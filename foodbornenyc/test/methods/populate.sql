Had the tuna as an appetizer and it was actually slightly frozen?!  Frozen tuna is not my idea of fresh. Then the monumental fail: extra spicy ramen.  It was like drowning in sea water.  It was alarmingly salty with no taste.  The broth was denser than anything I''ve ever seen.  When I questioned if they got the order right because aside from the pound of salt in that bowl it had zero spice.  They then brought me a small amt of an oiled pepper mix to add to the soup.  To be honest, I can make a ramen soup that is many times better using the one dollar packaged ones they sell at the store.  This stuff was egregiously bland yet too salty.  Also, the base they use for the soup is suspiciously identical to Knorr tomato cubes you can buy at the grocery store. When I tried to explain I was unsatisfied with the meal and didn''t feel I should pay for something I only tasted---no one spoke English!  The guy at the cashier in his really bad English told me he didn''t care and that he was going to charge me because they had made it for us and it didn''t matter we didn''t eat it.  Finally he only charged me for the appetizers but at the end I was soo fed up with them I was ready to donate my money to them.

I stopped in here figuring they had pancetta and I was right. From the outside I wasn''t sure if it was just another bodega masquerading as an Italian deli. Thankfully, it''s got that old school deli flavor with the brightly lit, spotlessly clean new school style. I went in after breakfast but before lunch so I was the only one, not knowing the procedure I went straight to the back and noticed the orders are taken up front. I heard some staff talking behind the counter and as I was about to approach another voice asked if I needed help. I put in my order and as he repeated it back to me in probably the most beautiful way I''ve heard pancetta pronounced. Seriously, I''d never heard it with an accent before. Anyway, as I was waiting I heard someone else yelling at my guy about how he should have asked if I wanted thin or thick cut. "What if he wants to make a sandwich?!" Yelled is too strong, it''s like a mom berating you for not taking out the trash. My guy came back and asked for the cut which was thin. As I was waiting I checked out their sandwich prices and noticed they were pretty cheap and saw their frozen section. They make their own sauces, pastas and meat sauce and whole 1lb pasta dishes that are flash frozen. I bought their spaghetti and meatballs and a San Bendetto tea, all still under the $20 mark. The pancetta was great in my dish. I ended up eating the pasta later and it was good. Definitely better than something you would find cruising the freezer aisle at C-Town.

It''s a famous neighborhood staple, and according to the baker I spoke to, their most famous item is the coconut drops.  There exists no superlative adjective adequate enough to describe the quality and taste of these drops.  I got them freshly out of the oven and the sweet doughy goodness is something that defies any Latin, American, Italian, or French bakery I''ve been to.  I would even go as far as to say this is my favorite bakery that I''ve ever tried.  They have bakes, doubles, aloo pies, and Chinese dishes among other Trini entrees.  I tried a bake with beef and it was fantastic, but I can never really tell the difference in the dough between the doubles and the bakes.  Doubles seem to be a little smaller and softer.  I tried the house special with  honey garlic chicken, fried rice, chow mein, and lo mein and took home some sweet bread which proceeds to melt in my mouth.  They ran out of some bakes I wanted to try, but the coconut drops and the sweet bread make it hard to believe that the others could compete.
