# Experiments

This folder contains the supporting code for `../Offical\ Results.ipynb`.

`baseline_experiment_helper.py` has all of the functions used in the offical results.

`best_models` has the final best models from each experiment regime used in the official results.

Pretty much all of the other files are for preliminary experiments. These are model declarations and separate scripts for running hyperparameter searches (they will likely be irrelevant).
