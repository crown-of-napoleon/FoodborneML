I was charged $17.00 and I wrote in the tip....In the morning I saw that my bank had contacted me to notify my of the charges on my card. Initially, I had thought that my card was lost when I was grabbing our coats at the coat check so naturally I blamed myself for the unauthorized charge on my credit card...but the following morning that wasn't the case because I had found my card in my car. Apparently Don Coqui or their servers feel they can switch up the credit card charges once their guests leave because according to my bank, once we walked out 40 minutes later my credit card had a credit reversal for $17.00 and instead I was charged $235.00 on my card for 1 coke and 1 midori sour. So to the server on my receipt by the name of 65 Jackie V. who swiped my card...learn your numbers  and to the \"manager\" by the name of Carlos. ....get more pull in your position and work on your customer service cuz as manager you should have had access to your transactions which I'm sure you did but we're to lazy to be bothered !!!

He says I can order two more mixed drinks and it'll be fine. I decide on settling for crappy beer and getting a side of the asparagus. No prob he says. He puts it all on my card. I know there's 18% included already, but I feel bad for the guy and I tip him an extra $10... on $41, after it's originally $66, for some appetizers and an entree.

I went up to the bar and tried to get one of the bartender's attentions. The girl poured herself a glass of water and leaned back watching people before she finally noticed me. I didn't want to seem like a bitch so I asked, \"Is the kitchen really backed up?\" She said, \"No, it's closed.\" And I gave her a surprised look. I said, \"I ordered asparagus almost an hour ago, I just wanted to know if they were almost ready.\" She walked over to the original bartender (a guy) and said something. He went to the kitchen, came back out, GRABBED A PLATE OF FRIES that had been sitting on the bar SINCE I originally ordered at 8:30 and said, \"Here's your order!\" with a smile on. I was like... that's not asparagus and it's cold.  He said, \"Oh, oops. Kitchen closed at 10?\" It's 10:05.  He already charged my card (around 9 when I ordered it) and the $10 I tipped is gone. He offers me a free drink, on the house, hands me bottom shelf vodka on the rocks. \n",

It was just a regular tuna roll (not exceptionally fresh) and some assorted random ass wack fish.  Wahhh.  I feel like wailing over this one.  The dessert- I can't really handle it at all.

When we were pondering if we should go in, the manager came out to greet us and make an introduction. The place was packed - a big group of people in the back and people waiting to get their orders. So there we decided to try. It turned out the group of people was the family and the reason people were waiting for their food was because the kitchen was too slow. My burger looked like a slider, $6.5, and it was branded Twist & Smash'd. My first short rib burger was raw in the middle. The manager came over and offered another burger, but unfortunately the 2nd was burnt. The end pieces of my friend's Idaho potato was undercooked. Apparently, the kitchen was not ready for the customers. The casher had trouble operating the cash register. The lemonade drinks were ok. The manager came over to apologize and gave us complimentary Twist & Smash'd bags and some snacks to make up for the food shock. I definitely have no interest to give a second try in a long time.\n",

There's no seperate entry way that most places install during the winter to keep the cold out when people enter (they have since added one) so it's bitter cold everytime the door opens. We ask the Hostess if we can wait for a table away from the door, she says sure, so we  wait, there's no place really to wait since the bar is full, so we end up standing up front next to the Hostess station/door.  While were waiting another couple walks in and they also tell the hostess they don't want to sit by the door. As this is happening space for two opens up a the bar.  The hostess aks if they'd like to eat at the bar and of course they say \"yes\" and get sat. So at this point I am slightly annoyed because had she asked us we would've gladly eaten at the bar, but I give her the benefit of the doubt and say nothing since we didn't  specify we'd sit at the bar if space opened.\n",

But, uh, the food is well, not that good. Im sorry! I feel terrible typing it even. I ordered the fried chicken and the meat was a low quality. Not terrible but below average. It was also dry and the strangest thing was there was hardly any meat to eat! I turned it round and round and contemplated eating the bones! The greens that came with it was such a small portion I didnt see them at first, the chicken leg concealed it. I was of course hungry after that so I ordered a side of cauliflower and boy was it old and strechy. I then ordered a shake because I coudnt take it anymore and just wanted calories. It was ok. The waiter said it was like a \"Wendy's frosty\". That didnt do much to make me want to order it but they withheld food for an hour so I was game and slurped the frosty down. I paid about $65 with tip. Anyways, I think true to Manahattan fakeness people come here to be \"hip\" or in proximity to a famous chef or be seen. Pretty pathetic. They line up around the bar and pose. And New Yorker's have the nerve to speak about Californians! This is why there is hype ongoing about this place. I live in the neighborhood. I was hungry. I wanted to find a place to eat because we simply do not have many places to eat around here. I mean how many red velevet cupcakes and cups of greens can a person eat? So folks, it was not the best Im afraid. Im sorry Red Rooster, I wanted to like you and I think you are ok but the very rude guy that takes reservations is not a plus and the waiters that think they are Obama's right hand man do not help either. All that aside, dont go hungry if you insist on trying this place. I know we all have suggestions but why cant they just get better quality meat, serve larger portions and do something to the fried chicken to make it taste unique? Serve a little unusual salad with it. For $1 of supplies they could make it much more pleasant. Where is this man's business sense? The vegtables should be fresh not dry and strechy. oh, geez, I hope something changes here because many people frown upon the food but just keep trying to wish the food to improve. The chef has the upper hand, I hope he doesnt think he can ride on his likeability forever.

It cost a whopping $11.75 - but I figured it was jam-packed with veggies and what I was told was \"wild\" rice.  When I got home I was shocked by the 75% full container, filled with a few flecks of wild rice, but about 90% regular white rice - not even Basmati or Jasmine - but what looked (and tasted) like regular parboiled white rice.  This probably should have cost $4.00, but I wouldn't be surprised by paying 6 or even 7 dollars (though it would have been a rip-off).  $11.75 is absolutely outrageous for about ten bites of rice mixed with some veggies.  The sad thing is, it tasted pretty good - This place could have had a loyal customer, if not for the overpriced small portions (at least in the case of the \"Baba Bowl\").\n",

My go-to order is 2 lbs of this cut into 3 pieces, ready to go in the freezer.  Their stuff has no preservative so I'd recommend cooking the same day or freezing.

The response to that was, \"absolutely no problem, we will sit the party at 7PM.\"  Fantastic.  I arrived at 7:15PM to my family at the bar, saying the table wasn't ready at 7PM and the hostess said \"maybe 20 minutes.\"  We all had a glass of wine and waited.  As I finished my glass, I realized some time had gone by (it was 7:45PM by then) and approached the hostess.   \n",

She (the same woman who had told us 20 minutes and she would come find us when the table was ready) immediately said she did not have our name, that if we were waiting for a table, we had to check in outside (though she had not previously stated that).  We went outside and they of course, did not have our name and the outside hostess said she could not help.  When we walked back inside, now realizing we have been waiting for 45 minutes for a table of 8 that we were apparently not going to ever get, the hostess IMMEDIATELY took insanely rude tone and began talking as if we had NO business being in her restaurant, had checked in wrong and were truly (not exaggerating) not privileged enough to be at the restaurant.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Long story short, we got a table after being verbally abused (the ONLY reason we stayed was that we were a table of 8 at now 8PM on 40th and 6th Ave).  When given our table, there were 7 chairs.  I kindly asked for an 8th, as the reservation was for 8 and we had 8 people... the outdoor hostess snapped, \"your friend [tone implied] said, 7.\"  I replied, \"the reservation was for 8 at 7PM, we need another chair, thank you.\"  It took 10 minutes to get another chair.\n",

      "First, I guess the food is supposed to be shared, so she brought out a couple small plates for both of us. The plates were stacked, and when my boyfriend went to hand my mine, we found a long black hair on the plate underneath. I tend to not like pointing out problems unless necessary, and we really didn't need the plates, so we didn't say anything. Next, my boyfriend had asked if one of the grilled cheeses was vegetarian, and the server said yes, but then he was brought a sandwich with meat, which he took a bite of and had to spit out. The server said it was her fault and apologized. On the menu, you have to specifically ask for the pancetta to be added, so it was kind of bizarre. Also, strangely, the sandwich came out first, way before his fries, or my salad. Then came the truffle fries, which were ok. Then, finally my Asian chicken salad, which managed to somehow be both the blandest thing I have ever eaten, yet also a little spicy. The whole thing was covered in a creamy spicy dressing, and that was all you could taste. I spent the whole time pushing it around my plate and being mesmerized by how bland it was. I ate a few bites and left most of it on my plate. Thankfully it only cost $9? Trying to see the positives here. Then my boyfriend got his vegetarian grilled cheese, which was delicious, because no one can screw up melted cheese on bread (overpriced at $8 though). \n",

The pasta was very good and they cracked open the head so we could eat the brain if we wanted to.  Some of us tried it out and it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either.

The bread however was very nice, and the fact that they had live lobsters, where they actually kill the lobster right before you eat it is impressive. I had the Chocolata with ice cream for desert and found it to be a bit hard and dry for my liking, you essentially had to chisel it to eat it. The original desert order I had wanted wasn't available since the oven was out of order.

      "Do not get the macarons though. The first time I had macarons from here was two years ago. I am back in NYC now and so I went for them because I loved them so much I used to dream about them. However, their macarons are unremarkable. The texture is so delicate that they break before you can even bite them. The construction looks sloppy. There is no chewiness of the inner part of the shell. I loved the black currant from here, but not anymore. It was overly sweet that I threw it away after a bite. The rose one had an off taste to it too. The coconut one still had the mellow coconut taste that I remembered, but it fell apart as soon as I tried to bite it that I could not even enjoy the moment. The espresso and pistachio were not that amazing. The vanilla one tasted like the vanilla ones from Trader Joes except I would perfer the ones from TJ's more because those have texture.\n",

With a delightful mix of flavors and textures.  I do not see myself going back to our feathered friend.  My only complaint is that upon a return visit, my sandwich was lacking in the vegetable department.  I was jealous of my girlfriends sandwich, all overflowing with pickled carrots and cilantro.\n",

I had been craving down home southern style food but I thought I'd give this place a try - soul food with a twist. The cashier at the window seemed pretty friendly and helpful while I placed my order.\n",

      "First, I'll start with what I thought was the best part of the meal - the cornbread. It was excellent and cake like but not sweet like typical southern style cornbread. The scallion butter was the perfect finishing touch but I would've preferred if it was served separately. By the time I got home the butter was all over and came through the bag the bread was in.\n",
      "The collard greens were delicious but in my opinion had to much of the sausage in one serving. The potato salad was very different but good however, it was hard for me not to compare it to what I'm used. It lacked the flavor that I'm used to in its traditional version. I had high expectations for the chicken but when I tried the breast - which is my favorite part - it was undercooked and the batter was still gooey in some areas. This is a definite issue that needs to be resolved. I had planned to try their wings at another time but after this experience I'm not sure about a repeat visit because the prices are pretty high to risk another chance at getting undercooked chicken.\n",

      "\n",
      "Strangely enough though, I tried these sandwiches recently and they aren't as good as when they made them at their original location.  Maybe it was because back then, I got to see how the sandwiches were made - the old lady behind the counter would heat the pork in the tiny oven and then scoop it out to stuff it into the bread.  Or maybe it was because they used to use a variety of meats (chicken, pate, and pork) in the sandwiches whereas now, they only use one type of meat in the #1...but my memory fails me, so I can't be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But irregardless, their sandwiches are still top notch and much tastier than any other Bahn Mi shop in Chinatown.  I have yet to try some of the newer places in the other boroughs (i.e. Brooklyn) so I'm reserving 5 stars for the yet undiscovered \"ultimate\" Bahn Mi.\n",
      "\n",

The first several times I went I can echo some of the other reviewer's notes on the slow service and overall sense that this staff doesn't yet \"have it together\" but I was willing to be patient.

      "I had my birthday party at Livingston Manor last weekend for around 10 people.  Shortly after we arrived a stranger at the bar began harassing my friend.  He was touching her inappropriately without her permission, whispering in her ear, and overall being a creep and not leaving her alone.  We immediately alerted the bar staff to his behavior but nothing was done.  After his behavior persisted we alerted the staff again who sent the bar back to speak with him.   The staff then told us that the man would \"keep his distance\".  Immediately after being told this, the man came back over and this time threatened my whole party, drunkenly insisting he did nothing wrong and we were all cunts and bitches.  We again alerted the staff of the bar asking why this man was not being kicked out of the establishment but they said that since they didn't see it they were not going to kick him out.  \n",

      "At this points, my friends surprised me with a lovely birthday cake and we had a large knife from the bar to cut and share the cake.  The man again came over to my party, threatened us, repeatedly asking some of my male friends to \"step outside\" and \"handle the situation\".  At this point, a friend of the man came over, also harassed us and asked us step outside and then picked up the knife from the birthday cake and threatened us with violence.\n",

      "Livid, we confronted the bar staff, including the owners, as to why this man was not kicked out the first time he behaved inappropriately.  Instead of dealing with the situation, the staff of the bar allowed this man and his friends to continue to harass us and threaten us with a weapon without taking any action.  FOUR TIMES we alerted the staff to their behavior and nothing was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several members of the staff made the excuse that they do not have a security staff and the bar back they sent to deal with the situation is \"only 22\" and \"has no security training\" so somehow, this is not their fault.  While the staff apologized, their apologies after the fact do nothing to rectify the situation or erase the harassment my friends and I experienced. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I would like to everyone reading this review to know is that Livingston Manor is not equipped with the proper personal to keep their patrons safe.  Furthermore, Livingston Manor will tolerate their patrons sexually harassing other patrons and threatening them repeatedly with violence and with weapons!  In my opinion it is 100% unacceptable that this man was not thrown out the very first time he inappropriately grabbed my friend.  The fact that he was allowed to stay and his behavior was allowed to escalate to the point that a knife was pulled on us is abhorrent.  It's important to note that Livingston Manor never threw this man or his friend out of the bar, they eventually left on their own.  So at no point did the staff of this bar intervene or handle the situation appropriately even after a weapon was brandished at our table.\n",

Loved that they came with a quail egg and that they split the portion for us. My boyfriend eats lightening fast so the fact that they split the portions ensured that I would get some food too (finally). For entree, I had the halibut which was a fish special. It was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had! It came with a smokey bacon/bean/cranberry side. My boyfriend really enjoyed his hangar steak. We also got the side of artichoke risotto which was creamy and delicious. For dessert, we pre-ordered the souffle and I have to say I was underwhlemed. It was good but not great. Maybe it was the fact that we had to pre-order it made me have huge expectations. I would love to come back and try other dishes. This restaurant did not get a 5th star for the simple fact that I did not enjoy the decor. There was not much ambience and I think part of the experience of eating out is having a cool ambience.\n",

I decided on a large leg and wing combo.  Spicy.  That's the way I like it!\n",
      "\n",
      "About 20 minutes later, my food was ready.  The chicken legs and wings were served in a frying pan together with some fries.  I probably should have ordered the regular size because the large was actually a bit too large.  In fact I could not finish everything.  I would say the large is definitely a meal for two people.  While I was eating, the cooks brought out a large pan of pig's feet and laid them a few tables from me in front of a fan to cool.  They must have been for the customers that night.  So in addition to chomping down on some tasty chicken, I also kept smelling some delicious pig's feet.\n",

For those not from Canada or who've never visited and experienced a delicious concoction of fresh-cut french fries, beef gravy, and cheese curds, called Poutine - you have absolutely got to try it sometime. You might even find it in Northern New Hampshire, but definitely a French-Canadian dish, probably best served and eaten across our northern border. For example, there's a food truck in Niagara Falls in a non-descript strip mall a few miles west of the tourist hotels on the Canadian side that serves an outstanding Poutine. Learned this from the Valet guy on a visit to the Falls, and have been back to the food truck 3x since. \n",

      "0.362062750292 A long overdue review of this wonderful place. My boyfriend surprised me with a birthday omakase in Dec 2014. After a year of dining at a lot of great restaurants, I can still honestly say that my meal here is top 5 in my books. If you want to eat here, there is a lot of planning that goes into it, as reservations open up a month in advance, apparently at midnight. Unfortunately I can't share my experience with booking the reservation (since my boyfriend did it) but I do know that he checked EVERY DAY for cancellations, which was how he got our coveted spot. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend the omakase, the sake pairing, and to sit at the sushi bar. There really is nothing like sitting at the bar watching the sushi chefs masterfully prepare your fish! I can't remember how many courses there were, but I do remember it being a beautiful symphony of flavors, carefully planned to build on each other from one piece to the next. The hay smoked salmon was out of this world, and fish that I would normally not eat tasted amazing. Quality was top-notch. Then there was the tamago at the end. If you watched \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" you know that the tamago was what Nakazawa struggled with getting right. And you know what - he did.\n",

      "0.361712144425 So I was hoping to find the Ramen Burger listing but with all the hype about it and lacking in reviews I wonder if I have not found the correct spot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my review for Ramen Burger. You know when people start a frenzy and you don't know if you want to go investigate and find out or run away and just find shelter to be safe? Ramen Burger craze was just that. They recently did a stint in Hawaii and I was gonna find out how it was. Yeah I seen it before in the media. Yeah there's a few people who are trying to imitate it (and from what I read the imitations suck here in Hawaii too). So the OG comes to town, I figure I gotta try it. Yeah I waited 3 hours for the first one and 2 hours for a second taste a few days later. Did I like it? Yes. Was it the best burger I ever had? No. Was it the best ramen buns I've ever had? It was the only time I ever did so that was default Yes. Would I buy it again? I did. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ramen and burgers are no strangers, especially in Hawaii. But to have ramen buns is the gimmick that I had to try. I always think about how much I love pasta and noodles and how it would be to have one fat noodle, like a huge block of lasagna noodle instead of layers or when you get the one bunch of chow fun noodles that didn't separate. I love that fat noodle feeling and texture. The ramen bun from Sun Noodle (they make dope ramen noodles period for some of my favorite regular ramen spots) was pretty good. yeah it was spongy, rubbery and not crispy like fried cake noodle. Some people see that as a drawback. I actually liked it but thought about how a crispy ramen bun would taste in comparison. The burger patty itself was good but their sauce is tasty. Somewhat like shoyu chicken sauce when you have leftovers and put it in the refrigerator and it turns into jello in the cold.  Overall its a good burger, it was tasty, and I liked eating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However I did not like the price. While others in the continental US were paying $8 for their ramen burger I didn't think it was worth $10. People were telling me before I got it that they were gonna use Kobe beef or something. They did use local beef but when I can get a bowl of my favorite ramen for the same price and a lot faster I have to choose traditional ramen. I also missed the traditional toppings like char siu or an egg (soft or hard boiled). \n",
      "\n",
      "I probably would buy another ramen burger, but at least now I know what I'm getting when I order one. I'm sure the long lines won't be a problem when they open a permanent spot.\n",

      "They have section of sake but be warned, if you attempt to try all of them in one sitting, you will break the same rule I broke - don't throw up inside, on the table.

I am not a food critic and don't have quite the right words to describe the soup, but it was like surprise bursts of flavor and texture with each bite. I could have had a whole second (and third) bowl of it. But luckily I saved the room for the salad, which was also fantastic. The variety of textures made this feel like anything but a boring salad, and it also had a mix of tastes that worked really well together.\n",

I ordered the Bronx bomber which is basically steak and eggs-on the menu it indicated it came with bacon wrapped in peas(or something lol). I don't eat pork so I asked for beef bacon, ends up that they actually changed that item, so it doesnt come with the bacon portion anymore. So, I got charged for a side of bacon-it was just a misunderstanding and I am sure if I asked them to take it off my bill they would have(I didn't bother because it was so good).

We ordered shumai, bean curd and fried pork dumplings. They were all good! I would have like to order other stuff but got too full real quick.

I am amazed at how \"night and day\" the whole evening was for myself and my guest. We were seated in the main dining room in a nice corner table near the center where we could take in the entire space. I seriously didn't realize how much it resembles a labyrinth, albeit a gilded and romantic one. Our server was attentive without being obtrusive and seemed to be genuinely excited about every ounce of food we ordered. The establishment had also arranged for a complimentary appetizer to be offered to us, which was a pleasant and completely unnecessary surprise. The little treats were like a Lebanese style panchetta (made of veal) in a mini pancake sandwich...so delicious. Once we had stuffed ourselves silly with all the Lebanese goodness the Pre-Fixe had to offer, the check came with an immense thank you and no rush at all to leave. While I finished my desert, one of the managers, Sheena, came over to thank me for returning and to ensure that I had a much more satisfying experience this time. I really have to say how amazing they handled this whole service issue. They really care about the individual links and go above and beyond to make sure that each guest's experience is as good as it can get.

      "0.355857189384 It seems that every now and then, I'll need a reminder that, as a 105 lb. girl, my stomach, unfortunately. has limits; and that I will definitely not feel well after eating three pork ribs, nearly 1/2 lb of brisket, biscuits and gravy, and cornbread. And that mac and cheese? Forget about it. (For all you skeptics thinking, \"What? You call that a lot of food? You eat like my baby sister!\" Well, I applaud you and the black holes you call your stomachs.)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First of all, from the outside of the restaurant, it seems that Morgan's is right next to Elbow Room, which sells mac and cheese. Once you're inside, the two restaurants will have merged into one - you get both menus and you can order from both on one check. This is great if you intend to order mac and cheese and want a wider variety to choose from.\n",

      "The highlight of the meal was definitely the pork ribs. The meat was smoky, juicy, and just tender enough to fall of the bone with a slight tug, without falling apart. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cornbread - standard, but not the best. I generally find that places err on the side of dryness, but Morgan's is actually a little too moist - perhaps because of the pepper jelly. It seemed more like pound cake than it did corn bread. However, the pepper bits inside do make it somewhat different from your standard cornbread.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fatty brisket was decent as well. My only criticism is that a big portion of it seemed more lean than fat, and not very juicy. I definitely needed a good dousing of barbecue sauce with each bite. Other than that, it was smoky and well-seasoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "For anyone who has had biscuits and (sausage) gravy before, and for anyone who has an expectation for a thick, creamy, slightly spicy, meaty, and hot gravy, I would shy away from this one. This one was a little too thick; it was warm at best; and had but a few tiny crumbs of sausage here and there. I think the bold flavors of the smokiness from the meat and the barbecue sauce might have overwhelmed my taste buds, because I thought that the first few bites of biscuit were flavorful, but after a few bites of brisket, the gravy became bland, and it became more chore than leisure to finish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, I only took two or three spoonfuls of mac and cheese, which I ordered from the Elbow Room menu. I had shared the Chicken Tinga Mac with someone, who ended up taking it home, but from the spoonfuls I did have, it was too dry for my liking. I like my mac to be a little saucier, and it just wasn't up to par. \n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, you're on this page, because you want barbecue, and in that case, you're probably better off ordering barbecue than mac, and probably some of the other sides that they offer, like the potato salad, which adds a nice acidity to the meal, or the collards. That being said, I haven't tried the collards, so I can't vouch for them, but after eating SO MUCH MEAT, greens seem to be a good idea.\n",

My server Christian he's A* with a smile on his face which is very important for an restaurant to have a waiter like him! Keep it up chris! You doing great! Food was excellent! Price for special entree should be less! That's what I think! None of the customer should leave with left over food bag (I did) that's not good for a restaurant! You know what's the reason??? Because you guys are serving way too much food! Even your appetizer is huge! Please cut down its a waste! You don't want your customer to eat the same food next day! You want them to come back the following day! Trust me your food is great! Also the appetizer price should be less! & your fried calamari is not fresh it's frozen! Please don't sell frozen calamari! Other than that everything is great! Now! now! I asked my waiter to open the window! He did open it for me only! I think during the summer time you should have your windows open! Saves money on electricity! Plus people from outside will smell your delicious food! Trust me it will make them come inside! Music shouldn't be american cmon guys you should be playing Peruvian songs or Latin songs! Your not a american restaurant! Manager please SMILE when you greet your customer! Button up! showing your chest is not good! & let go your sleeve having it rolled up doesn't look nice! Don't sit on top of the BAR NOT GOOD! Go around talk to your customer!

WRONG! Two Boots apparently started carrying Daiya vegan cheese a few weeks previously. Awesome! They still have the boring Mother Earth, which some people must like since it's been around for years at all their locations, but thankfully for me, they now offer a veggie slice with Daiya cheese. I went with that and it was $4 - not bad! The pizza was right on - hot, gooey cheese, fresh veggies, and a decent-size serving. I actually regretted not having gone back for a 2nd slice.

Two of my friends and I decided to do a 3-way belated-birthday meal amongst ourselves and thought  Babbo would be an appropriate gift to ourselves.  After weeks of coordinating and planning, we called 30 days before our desired date and spent an hour attacking the reservation line to eventually end up with a Saturday evening 10:30 pm reservation.

While the braised oxtail itself was good, both the spaghettini and gnocci weren't as well integrated with the sauce and other ingredients as I had hoped they would.

I do not understand why restaurant owners do not take a more proactive approach to getting feedback from their diners. Even if you do not want care what others have to say (see how far this gets you), at least you can do damage control on your own terms without it being documented publicly.

My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate his new promotion by giving soul food in Harlem another shot, only this time we would go directly to the Mecca of soul food.  I prepared myself for the the best down-home southern cooking to be had.  How could it not be awesome?  It's Sylvia's!  It's a national landmark!  (The boyfriend is Filipino and I think the closest he's come to traditional southern cuisine is Popeye's Fried chicken, so he was more or less along for the ride).\n",

I decided the best thing to do would be to stick to the basics- fried chicken (white meat), garlic mashed, and mac & cheese.  The potatoes were actually delicious and the mac & cheese was pretty good too.  The chicken, however, was a failure.  All I could taste was salt.  Every bite of that skin required two gulps of beer to rehydrate my mouth.  After a couple of tries, I realized this salt insanity was not localized to one part of the chicken so I peeled the skin off entirely.  The bird was still a bust because the meat was DRY.  So there you have it, the double kiss of chicken death- salty and dry.  You CAN NOT be a world-class soul food joint and serve up such shitty fried chicken.  \n",

That said, you're better off spending half as much and getting twice as much at Popeye's: The potatoes and mac & cheese won't be quite as good, but almost.  The chicken will certainly be a hell of a lot better.\n",

I'd heard that we might have to wait, but we were given a table immediately in the back, which was a lot quieter and more pleasant than sitting inside.

Plus, we got out of there a lot quicker than I thought we would, we received our food incredibly fast.  I've yet to have a brunch on Smith that's better, but I haven't lived here long, so we'll see.  For the meantime though, go here for the pancakes.\n",

The whole fish, a turbot, which is like a flounder, served whole was greasy once turned over and was barely enough as an entrée for one at $38! All portions are extremely small. The salad was Frisee and nothing else! As a result, the total meal for 3 was $265, subtracting the 2 bottles of wine it still amounted to $170 for three and I was still hungry! Tiny tables!

Not even a hint of eggnog but what I will brag on is that strawberry butter. That's the bees knees. That, I asked for more of. The chicken was crispy and flavored well. The mac and cheese was really good. My friends catfish was delicious and the spinach was fresh. That's definitely what I'm ordering when I come back. However, I wasn't a fan of the peach cobbler.

I'm guessing it's mostly foreigners to NYC who are staying at the Sheraton next door and feel the need to complain about their less than average lifestyle.  I'm a New Yorker and I work nearby.  This place has good food and good prices.. a wide variety of sandwiches and paninis available for lunch, and from what I can tell, everything is fresh and the deli is exceptionally clean.  I don't Yelp often, but I felt this place needed some love.  They're friendly, the food is good, they have good prices, and they're clean.. what more can you ask for in NYC?

There's a lot of Jamaican food in this neighborhood, and while this place is good it didn't exactly blow my mind, given that each item's about $4-6 more than most of the hole in the wall joints nearby.  The curried goat wasn't quite as punchy as I'd hope, the oxtail was good but mostly bone, and the mac and cheese was just ok.  In general it was pretty good stuff, just given the prices it wasn't quite worth it in my mind.

I like this place because, like most diners, it offers breakfast all day. They also offer some typical Latin American dishes for breakfast which is uncommon at a diner. My problem with this place is that the food can sometimes come out cold. For example, I've ordered the mangu twice and both times it's come out cold. Never again. The waiters are always super nice and getting it re-heated but I just find it annoying. Hot food should come out hot! On another note, they have a greek style panini which is absolutely delicious.

      "0.315215394767 THE BEST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD. I trekked across our fair island yesterday to pick up a couple of steaks based on their reputation. To my chagrin, I arrived home with hamburger instead of steak, a major disappointment. I spoke with Evan Lobel today who sent four NY strips to my home. Lobel's has an excellent sense of customer service and had a real desire to rectify the mishap -- I must also mention I am no stranger to steak, and hands down, this was the best steak I've ever had. Better than an Ottomanelli's cut, better than Luger's, quite simply the best steak I've ever had. Worth the $, worth the trip.\n",

After many experiences with halal carts around Manhattan, I've come to conclude that nothing really hits the spot like Sammay's. They cook their meat with onions. Halal guys got nothing on Sammay's. Also, his cart says Sammay's. So is it Sammy's or Sammay's? Can I get some answers around here? \n",

In the past, when we did RW, we found that many establishments gave you substitutes to make  up for the lower prices for RW. They would give you smaller portions or cheaper cuts of meat, etc.  The whole point of RW is to give prospective customers a chance to try the place at a lower price point. But if you go and serve them something not up to normal standards at your restaurant, then it would have been a waste of time for both the business and the customer.\n",

I've had the good old standy's at places like Peter Luger, Ruth's Chris, and Old Homestead, among others so I have some points of reference. The steak that I had at MarkJoseph's beats out ALL of the above. The steak was lean with just the right amount of fat that was't even visible but you could taste the tenderness in the meat. I got mine medium rare.\n",

In fact, if you put half as much oil, it would STILL be too much oil. Oil is not good for us and probably costs you money. So I see it as a win-win if you just put less oil. I finished my oil drenched Lamb Cumin dish and there was enough oil left in the plate to fill a small baby bottle. \n",

The CHICKEN SOUP - get it. It feels like some good home cookin' and comes with white rice.. drool. Also, their guac is pretty good, comes with plantain chips.

The food was robust Puerto Rican Cuisine.  I had a bean soup that was amazing.  Then tasted an Octopus salad, and a shrimp patty that was made from scratch.  I had a skirt steak with yellow rice.  It was very good.  They make their own hot sauce which is not extremely hot.  I had a homemade Flan which was really good.  The bill was very reasonable.   I also liked the presentation of the food.  I can only imagine that some people who gave this a poor review are really over critical.  It is hard to find Puerto Rican Cuisine because most of the Spanish places around are Colombian.  They did a really good job and with reasonable pricing this is a fun place to bring your family.\n",

I really wasn't that impressed with the bread.  For appetizers I ordered the fried calamari.  They were very good; light and not greasy at all.  The sauce that accompanied it was good too.\n",
      "For dinner I had the gnocchi bolognese and my girl friend had the fettucini alfredo.  The gnocchi was good but I prefer the one at Cara Bella located not too far away on 30 Ave.  The bolognese was good too but I was expecting more based on past reviews.  The fettucini was more on the lines of what I was expecting; the pasta's consistency was excellent and so was the sauce.\n",

I really look forward to dessert at Italian restaurants and in my opinion Italian food is well know for desserts and pastries.

They do a really good job of rotating just the right amount of a pretty wide variety of vegetarian, vegan and all-natural meat products to keep customers satisfied.  It's pretty standard \"health food\" cuisine but very competently done.  The store itself is fairly comprehensive, too, and the pricing is a lot cheaper than the Manhattan or even Queens independent Health shops, not to mention.  The funny thing about this place is for all the ethnically diversity and hippie demographic of customers and staff alike, I swear I get a suspicious, almost angry vibe, every time I go there.  Maybe I'm missing something.  I'm not from Staten Island - I live in Queens and usually work in Manhattan with cultural outings to Brooklyn once or twice a month.  I've spent the last two months on assignment in the Borough, frequenting the shops in the New Dorp / Dongan Hills area.  I swear, there's something edgy about the way they eye me and other customers who are apparently not regulars and the tension in their voice when they say \"Can I HELP you with something?\" By contrast, when I go into Joe's Lobster House which kinda looks like a stereotypical \"wise guy\" hangout (and I don't look like one of them) they all but hug me and kiss me on both cheeks.

The only thing I would do different next time is to ask for double tortillas on each taco to make them less messy to eat.

We loved our meals and had left room for dessert. We got the O Mi Cha Dragon which was a perfect portion for 2.

I also had codfish croquettes which were tasty I'm my opinion but maybe a tiny tiny bit undercooked.

Keep it spicy with the guacamole (you get your choice of mild, medium, and spicy... but there is really only one choice). Then for dinner, choose the Pollo Norteño.

The food is good, the drinks are fine (especially if you're into German beer), and it's just so cozy inside. If it's busy, then the service is so scattershot it's nearly hilarious. It's like the four or five service people don't know what any of the others are doing, so they all end up covering for each other part of the time and ignoring you the rest (eg. three people will ask you if you want another drink, but nobody takes a food order).

There are various type foods, such as a turkey club, philly cheese steak, calamari, quesadilla, chicken wings, wraps, salads... and then there's the Himalayan foods. A bit weird, but I kind of like the variety in case I want to eat other things. For my first time here, I went with \"different\" so I ordered chilly chicken (with gravy) sauteed with bell peppers, onions, and spices; mothuk, a traditional Tibetan momo soup with beef dumplings in a beef broth; sha bhakleb, Tibetan beef patties in fried dough; and potatoes that were in the counter area. Everything came with a light, airy huge tingmo.  While the chicken and mothuk were good, I don't know if I would order them again. I wasn't wowed, but it wasn't bad either. Not that I have anything to compare it to until I hit up Wasabi Point again and Himalayan Yak to try their take on the same dishes. The highlight was the sha bhakleb - it's addicting and comes in 5 relatively large dough pieces. Make sure you have a plate underneath when you take a bite, the juices will flow and you won't want to talk until you have devoured every morsel. It's that good.\n",

Lunch special is advertised as any soup or salad, and any pasta, pannini or pizze. I was informed that the only pizza available on the lunch special was the Margarheta. The insalda mista was good, the Pizza Margarheta was fine as well.  Overall, an OK place but certainly not worthy of 3 or 4 stars.\n",

It was the perfect balance of 'ma-la' - usually when you go to places that have this flavor profile it's either too weak or so strong you can't feel your tongue anymore.

Here in NYC sushi is all the rage but sushi is NOT Japanese food. That would be like saying Pizza means Italian Food. So let's just get that straight. Sharaku has a pretty extensive menu and if you are familiar with Japanese food the menu can be a little intimidating. I'll say that the menu is a little too big and layed out kinda weird. A little disorganized so its hard to see what time the special ends and what specials are available on what day. However, everything they make here is great and the price is worth it.\n",

      "0.296353606536 This event in its beginning stages was still a bit primitive. I was pretty excited to check this out but we left somewhat disappointed. Night markets have been successful in Asia for a number of reasons--the weather is cooler, people are out from work and have time to socialize, it's an alternative to getting drunk in a loud bar. An international night market would potentially work well for Queens by bringing together the best of the vendors and shopkeepers currently opening late in different parts of the borough. As it stands though, the food quality wasn't that special and frankly pretty below average with mostly unjustifiable prices. There were some highlights (purple corn juice?), but others are right in that you can really get better versions of most of the food here by venturing to the right neighborhoods in Queens. Nevertheless, it's still a great concept and a good environment, and I hope that it has the potential to really grow into a Smorgasburg of sorts (but hopefully cheaper and more diverse).\n",

For some reason, I'm attracted to old man drinks, and the Gentleman's Agreement which consisted of a fresh blackberry draped elegantly on the concoction of Scotch, maraschinos, blackberry and fresh lemon juice, was a beautiful drink. Perhaps I shouldn't have done this, but I dipped my toothpick blackberry into the drink which made it taste so much sweeter. \n",

The taste of the pancakes by themselves was just okay.  I really enjoyed the fresh blueberries though.  And the maple butter is very good.  Apparently if you sop the pancakes in said butter, then they become quite tasty.  Why can't they taste good on their own though?  The hashbrowns were very simply prepared.  No onions or noticeable spicy seasoning of any sort.  This should have been a failure, but I found myself coming back to them again and again.  They were surprisingly good.

French toast tasted like the bread was freshly baked and it didn't even need syrup, yum.  You can get get your scrambled eggs made to order: wet or dry.

      "0.292027429142 After hearing all the hype about The Spotted Pig I felt the need to check it out. It was also a good change from the pretentious restaurants I've been going to latley (i.e. Sette Mezzo, Philippe, Nello's etc.). The Spotted Pig is a very trendy low-key pub that's a mix of a hipster hang-out and a place to people watch. The place is always crowded and since they don't take reservations, getting a table can be a bit difficult. With investors such as Jay-Z & Mario Batali its no wonder the place is so popular. Since Jay-Z bought the building where The Spotted Pig is, they've added an upstairs bar and dining room so this has somewhat helped the large crowds overflowing onto the sidewalks. April Bloomfield is the head chef and the menu consists of Italian & English fused dishes. For lunch the menu isn't really anything to rave about. The Spotted Pig serves their 2 staple dishes (Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi and the Burger with Roquefort Cheese) and basically that's all everyone in the restaurant orders. I saw perhaps one person order the Cubano Sandwich and everyone else either had the Gnudi or the Burger. The whole restaurant is very \"hipster\" from the waiters in Ray-Bands and plaid shirts to the water served in wine bottles and the brown paper over the table cloths. The food however is very gourmet. As an appetizer I had the special of the day which were Duck Eggs with a salad in a vinaigrette and bacon. The dish was good, nothing mind blowing, the saltiness of the bacon went well with the duck eggs and the contrast between the dressing and the saltiness of the bacon was a nice touch. The Burger is served with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries. The cheese's sharp flavor actually went well with the large burger and so did the mountain of Shoestring fries. The gnudi, essentially a ricotta dumpling, was very rich and you could tell the ingredients, such as the sheep ricotta, were fresh. The Flourless Chocolate Cake was a slab of rich chocolate fudge that was a bit too heavy to have all by myself, but if you share it the dish is just fine. While I did enjoy my lunch at The Spotted Pig I do feel the place is a bit overrated. The menu has 2 hits and the rest sort of goes under the radar with most diners. If I were in the area I'd return, but if I was told the wait was longer than 45 minutes I don't think the wait would be worth it.\n",

It definitely does have an upscale feel to it, but nothing over the top. The bar and dining are dark but intimate and it wasn't too crowded. The food? Pretty solid! We got the bruschetta and house meatballs for apps. I am SUPER picky about my meatballs but these were pretty yummy.

Their hot sauce is pretty brilliant with franks red hot mixed with siracha.  The drinks are decent, i like the bloody mary and the red beer.  The food however just isnt the trek from manhattan.  I would say based on other brunches ive had this is just slightly above average ive had in manhattan.

The decor was gorgeous, I loved the arches and the lights. We enjoyed our corner banquette seating where we could have our privacy and people watch, but a couple they later sat next to us sniffed at the fact that they couldn't see and be seen and switched tables. Perhaps if I have any quibbles with Daniel, it is that it's that kind of place where a few, not many, had their noses too far in the air.

      "Chicken Tikka Masala - Cooked in the same fenugreek-flavored tomato sauce as the Fish Tikka, the difference with this particular preparation was that the chunks of tandoori chicken were served *in* the gravy, as opposed to being basted - then grilled - with it (the sauce).  And, frankly, I felt like the chicken got lost in all of the sauce.  Plus, the meat was a bit tough, which I chalked up to the fact that it continued to cook in the warm, bland sauce. \n",

      "Saag Paneer, Dal Makhni - While I found the paneer in the saag to be rubbery and flavorless, I fell in love with the Dal Makni.  Black lentils, simmered overnight with onion and garlic (among many other ingredients), were finished with butter and cream.  The result?  A soupy-like slurry, if you will.\n",

      "Naan - It would be hard to mess up homemade naan, at least in my eyes.  This fluffy, moist, and warm, pillowy flatbread proved the perfect measure of scooping up extra sauce and/or making \"burritos\" out of the proteins from our entrees. \n",

Not the ideal temperature/condition for a dinner, but nonetheless, we had a kickass time. Compliments will have to go to the food and our awesome waitress, Fleur?, who was a trooper - pausing for all our questions & my bickering about wtf is up with the AC. If it wasn't for her great smile and cheerful attitude, dinner could have been a disaster. Thank you Fleur for helping me realize to shut up, drink, eat, and drink. \n",

My wife ordered tofu with a sesame paste on top and it was delicious...soft, warm silken tofu with a sweet and tangy sauce. Gyoza were a delicate dough, fried just right, so they were not spongy at all. Minced pork with delicate ginger and scallion.\n",

I don't really fuse about music cause I'm not gonna remember it when I'm trashed anyway.  But, I know they had a good mix of genres.  Nothing worse than listen to 6 hours of straight house music (thump thump thump thump).\n",

The place was almost full, but there were a few tables (a little strange for a Saturday night, but I think the economy is really hitting restaurants hard). The meal started with bread, little jalepeno rolls (so good) and cornbread muffins. Next was soup, crawfish bisque (a weekend special) and seafood gumbo for my husband. Both were very good and thick with lots of seafood. Then I ordered the shrimp  ettoufee  and my husband ordered the shrimp creole. Both were very good, nice sized shrimps in sauce served with rice. We didn't have room for dessert. I ordered a second drink, and the waitress forgot about it for a bit, but remembered before I had to remind her, and then didn't charge us for it because of the wait. Overall, a very nice place, good food and a comfortable vibe. I liked the fact that the music wasn't too loud and you could still talk.\n",

I eat here at least once a week since it launched across the street from my office. Ive had the chicken quesadillas which are plentiful and good size, bbq pulled pork sandwich, wings, buffalo chicken sliders. Pasta dishes and even cocktails galore. Sometimes the bartender doubles for waiter. We know on those days the weight will be long to get our order. But major kudos to him for doing two jobs at once. It's not easy that's for sure. For the summer they now have outside seating. Come early or expect a wait for lunch. It gets pretty crowded. We usually got with a group of 10 so that big table is always available. I think it needs some good music but other than that I think the place is nice for lunch, dinner and even a non stuffy date place.

I'll go in dressed down to see how people treat me so I can decide whether the service is good.  This place had great food, professional service, CHARMING atmosphere. Plenty of space between tables so you are not on top of each other. They do not take reservations for parties of less than 6 however which presents a problem for me. I cannot bring business colleagues or out of town friends unless we can make it here by 6 for dinner.  You'll have to stand for an hour and a half waiting if you get here later.  They were packed even on a Tuesday night.  It's obviously a good place that doesn't have to worry about your repeat business because they have plenty of business already and, though they will be very pleasant and professional about it, they will start rushing you around 8. Do not get me wrong....I will try to make it back here...I enjoyed it.  They don't need your business if you are an older professional though.  There are plenty of young people spending their money here and they don't need you.   We tried a sea bass special which was cooked to perfection and a duck that was just  a touch overcooked but still absolutely delicious.  My husband's soup was perfect and I can highly recommend the plum tomatoes stuffed with cheese over arugula. The olive oil, balsamic vinegar and cheese was obviously quality. I'm looking forward to trying other selections on the menu. The Martinis we ordered were very dry, just as ordered. Everyone there was very attentive. No complaints whatsoever about the service.

The rice is mostly a hit or miss. On occasion it will taste delicious, but most of the time it's mediocre. I'm not a fan of the salad. The pita bread is good when not overcooked. Sometimes it can be burnt and hard from overcooking. Overall, I say it's either a hit or miss with the side items, but the chicken is always good. The sauce is delicious too!\n",

I don't mind dishes being sweet, but I could not bear the taste of the sauce.  The stuff on the inside was pretty unappetizing.  I understand that it's dumpling filling, but it was choppy and hard.  It didn't taste very good, and it had a really unappetizing mouthfeel as well.  I couldn't finish them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the broad black noodle dish was excellent.  Lots of noodles, with a good ratio of broccoli, chicken, and egg.  Everything was very moist, but not swimming in its own moistness.  There was quite a lot, some of which I brought home, where it heated up nicely for a late night snack.\n",

The ribs were a smoked type instead of the grilled type of rib I am used to typically. They were very meaty, moist and well seasoned but the sesame slaw side was not very good in my opinion...yuck! The dessert was also very good as well. My friend had the smoked sausage appetizer which was delicious and moist like the ribs.

      "After a recent dinner at Little Park, I imagine that Andrew Carmellini's process in crafting the high-level seasonal and sustainable menu may have looked a lot like that. The local, vegetal concept is the great idea we have all heard a dozen times before, but the challenge facing Mr. Carmellini is in creating food that defies our preconceived notions of this common idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't pause to consider what the shit iterations of some of these dishes may have looked like because, fortunately, Mr. Carmellini has a great deal of imagination, and his food at Little Park, while not without its imperfections, is exceedingly fresh and unique. Mr. Carmellini is taking risks in his cooking to avoid the tired and the ordinary, and while some resulting dishes are still stuck at just \"ok,\" many are, in fact, awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "I yearned for a greater depth of flavor in the Big Eye Tuna, whose red fresno peppers brought a little too much heat to the delicacy of the tartare, which was also served a little too close to room temperature. The pickled heads of the white beech mushrooms deftly punctuated the dish, though, the vinegar a welcome addition to the fresh radishes and herbs sprinkling the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Better was the Mushroom Carpaccio, an elegant plate of thinly sliced royal trumpet mushrooms marinated in a rich, meaty ragu with cured egg yolks. Here, Mr. Carmellini knows that providing a handsomely carnivorous foil to a plate can make a vegetable an even stronger star, and indeed, the best bites were towards the center of the dish where the mushrooms had had a chance to marinate even more deeply in the juices.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while the idea of strawberries in a salad recalls for me the soggy salad bar at a Souplantation, the Strawberries and Burrata with arugula and summer herbs was creamy, peppery, and sweet in all the right places. The strawberries themselves were small, tender, and without a note of acidity or bitterness, which could have decimated the plate, instead only highlighting phenomenal quality burrata that would certainly impress any connoisseur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Carmellini's food here pays special attention to the vegetable notes and accents across plates, even in the mains like the Scallops with chanterelles, brown butter, and nettle, and the Long Island Duck with turnips and tangy grapes. Rounds of dark duck sausage take on the same texture and sweetness as the grapes and olives beside it, an exceedingly democratic approach to the dish that biases neither the meat nor the vegetables supporting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many ways my entire meal here is a part of the creative process, the restaurant simply a step in the evolution of seasonal, farm-to-table cooking, and in many ways Little Park is truly a young descendant of restaurants like Blue Hill. It's still an exciting, creative, adventurous work in progress, and the young, downtown-based diners looking for a power lunch or a dinner date will intuitively accept the dishes that occasionally swing and miss because of the ingenuity and inventiveness upon which the cooking is founded.\n",

We went with a groupon for 4 tapas and the portions were way to small especially the price ranges were around $12-15 and that is too expensive for appetizers... my deal comes with sangria. Definitely has no wine taste more like a fruit punch. I paid $35 for 4 tapas and sangria and they add 16% gratuity and the total paid price with groupon, tips, and taxes came out to $60. For 4 tapas and sangria and still very hungry afterward. NOT WORTH THE PRICE.\n",

At just 6 dollars a pound, it's very affordable! If I get a chance to go back I'll try the banana pudding which looked damn tasty\n",

      "0.270472836772 The first time I tried Front Toward Enemy, someone in suspenders and a bow tie (the host?) ushered us through black velvet curtains.  We arrived into this gorgeous cavernous hall, beautifully decorated with damask wallpaper and metal sculptures - it was otherworldly.  The menu had very little on it, but the cocktails were unique (as you'd expect from a speakeasy-style bar).  We tried a couple of really authentic cocktails, munched on some apps and vibed with the 60s soul music.\n",

      "We recently returned expecting the same but the place has changed dramatically.  No longer were we stepping into this darkened speakeasy - there was al fresco dining and doors were wide open, giving us a lovely view of the gas station across the street.  Ugh.  Menu had a lot more food and a lot less cocktails.  In fact, it was reduced to 5 different kinds of mules, a daquiri and a dark and stormy.  There was also a live band that was a 5 on a scale of 10.  I hope they return to their roots, there are 5,000 other places in Astoria that offer al fresco dining, amateur music and 5 cocktails.\n",

I love the grilled corns. my absolute favorite and such a deal -  two corns under $4. I tried to make it myself but not the same. good cuban sandwich. Since the place is pretty small you need to wait until someone leaves and can hear next table's conversations but well, that's also a part of the fun(!??!!).\n",

      "0.26927768716 I absolutely love the food and concept. Staff was fantastic (I even met the owner) and I had the best octopus of my life. You really should try this place. I will certainly be going again and this will be a place I take out-of-towners to.\n",

We desired to sit in the back by the kitchen (seemed like a fun option!), and the hostess was extremely friendly and accommodating. Our waiter was very funny, amicable, and knowledgeable about the menu. I had great interactions with the cooking staff in the kitchen, other diners at nearby tables, (lots of jokes and smiles all around) and it made the overall experience very memorable. Not only did I have fantastic food (it really was fantastic), but I just had a great time, in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon leaving, I was addressed by the owner, who shook hands with me and asked me how everything was. We chatted for about 5 minutes. I left feeling very impressed and I really enjoyed the high-quality but laid-back atmosphere of the place. It is a little on the loud side (but pretty typical for NYC), so I wouldn't call it a place to go to unwind, but it was so nice to just be able to receive great service with a smile with plenty of jokes and laughs sprinkled in here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't mean to make it sound like this is a comedy club or anything - I just wanted my review to highlight the fact that the staff was very dynamic and vibrant, which is something I personally enjoy when I go out to eat.

This is one of those music venues I had heard so much about, and I had been perusing the calendar for months, but when I actually walked around inside, it was nothing like I imagined!  That was a good thing, however. It's fun imagining when this place really was a candy store, or luncheonette back in the day.\n",

I've gotten the Spicy Sriracha Noodles with chicken and shrimp several times, their steak with rice, their volcano chicken (which they set ablaze in front of you), and my new personal favorite is their Queen of Siam shrimp with rice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their mojitos have always been great, and their cocktails are fairly good. My favorite's the Tigers Eye. The Thai Long Island Iced Tea. Their lemon drop martini is spectacular as well, and Well drinks during happy hour are $5 a pop, beer's $3 a bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service has always been prompt. Wait times for a table can exceed ten minutes on busy nights, but the food and ambience are worth it. The bathrooms are always spotless. And as stated previously, if you want to take a girl out somewhere nice, this is the place to go!\n",

This is a tiny cafe that's carved out of what could, quite literally, have been a hole in the wall. There are three, maybe four tables, and a little bar-style table with stools facing the street. After standing around for five minutes, we were able to grab the bar-style table. My almond chai left me very, very satisfied: it was hot and creamy, with the right amount of almond flavouring in it. I tend to be very picky when I ordered flavoured warm drinks (I usually find the flavour too subtle or too overpowering), but these guys got it just right, and that instantly gives them five stars in my book. While sitting around and sipping our drinks, a steady stream of locals came in to grab coffee to go. The barista seemed to know a lot of them, which leads me to believe that this place has a strong following. I highly recommend it if you're ever in Hell's Kitchen.\n",

It seems like this place is having the perfect sort of identity crisis for our neighborhood, in a way that seems to work.  Part young professionals still in suits for happy hour, part afropunk/boho trendy with faux hawks, etc.  Particle board is an interesting choice, and I agree that at one point I considered the fire hazard, but hey: keep your overhead low to begin, if you want to survive right?\n",

No wait when we arrived, but when we were leaving the line had become 20 people out the door! Tiny place, seats maybe 12-14 in the back - we were lucky with timing to find seats.

      "0.263326225355 I've been spoiled.  I grew up in New Haven county in CT and love Pepe's, the best pizza you will eat.  Even the pizza in my home town, in the New Haven style, is really, really good.  Sal and Carmine's pizza is average at best, in my opinion.  It's thin, which is proper, but it just nothing special or different from other average pizza.  I had a slice of pepperoni.  The pepperoni was not a good quality.  I could not taste the sauce and the cheese was very mild.  It was salty, as some of the other reviewers noted, but not more salty than other pizza.  I think that the pizza lacks flavor, therefore you taste a lot of salt (found in cheese, sauce, meat, etc).  Salt intensifies flavor, but does not work if there is little flavor to enhance.  I would probably go back because it was edible and better than other pizza on the UWS; that is why they received 3 instead of 2 stars.  I respect that they are a long-lived pizzeria.  I wonder if it was better in the past; I'm not sure.\n",

I recommend skipping the garlic bread, for a serious low carb lunch.   While these steaks may be a \"tad\" chewy, the flavor can't be beat.  Last time I went to Spark's the steak was more tender but had way less flavor.  I'm a carnivore; I have teeth:  gimme a steak with flavor and I'll happily chew it.   \n",

      "0.262988955019 Lenny & John have become regulars at our dining table lately.   We found this pizza shop (a suggestion from a wise co-worker who lives in the area) and we are not giving it up any time soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In no particular order here are a few things that are good at Lenny & John's:\n",
      "\n",
      "The pizza.  Is really good.  Every single time we've gone to pick up, the pie comes out of the oven bubbling.  Perfect amount of cheese and sauce to not make it soggy or too dry.  and on Tuesday's you can score a large regular pie for $8.  Forget the 5-5-5 deal at Domino's down the street... we'd rather pay more for L&J.  Every other day of the week a regular pie is $13, which is still not bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you aren't in the mood for an entire pizza... or even an entire slice of pizza you could pick up a pepperoni roll.  At $1.25 each, and filled with mozzarella and pepperoni they are a solid investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "If pies and rolls aren't your thing you could also try the balls*.  Rice balls.  For only $1 (your choice- cheese or meat) and about the size of a hand ball, they too are a good investment.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Next up- the heros.  To put it simply- the meatball hero is amazing.  I consider myself a bit of a meatball connoisseur and these could rival Gramp's meat-a-balls.  (Sorry Gramps, but its true!)  Hubby tells me the sausage/pepper hero and the chicken parm hero are pretty excellent too.  Heros are $6-7 and you can add mozz to anything for an extra $1. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I should add that the staff is always friendly.  Even when the shop is busy, which it has been basically every time we've gone in, they take their time with each person to make sure the order is correct.   \n",

They've got big windows along two walls for good, natural light.  The nice thing is that even when it's busy, you'll still usually be able to find a spot to sit and work without being bothered or bumped by other customers.  Great place to bring your laptop and get some work done.  Only downside is that Starbucks doesn't offer free wi-fi.\n",

      "I've been on a mission to find a great bagel in my new hood, and until walking into The Pulp & The Bean I had been unsuccessful.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Pulp & The Bean has a small storefront right next to an entrance to the Franklin Ave 2, 3, 4, 5 subway stop (read: convenience).  There is minimal seating (2 small tables and chairs + a bench outside), but the service is quick and food and drinks are awesome.  I stopped in with a few friends on a Saturday morning, we all ordered bagels with various kinds of cream cheese + some lattes.  I had a multigrain bagel with olive cream cheese.  Usually multigrain bagels are only ok, but this one was amazing.  There were pumpkin seeds, it was soft and tasty.  The olive cream cheese was perfect, lots of olives, minimal pimentos.  My girlfriend got an everything bagel with garlic cheddar cream cheese.  The bagel, again, was great.  The garlic cheddar cream cheese was VERY garlicy.  I like garlic, but I couldn't have eaten a whole bagel with that cream cheese, but my girlfriend and our other friend (who also got the garlic cheddar cream cheese) loved it and happily devoured their extra garlicy breakfasts.  So just a piece of endive, if you're a casual garlic user you might want to take a pass but if you're a garlic junkie the garlic cheddar cream cheese is definitely for you!\n",
      "We also got a hazelnut soy latte.  It was great.  I usually get coffee from Starbucks and it was better then that, but not by much.\n",

Both were pretty good, although I think the cereal milk one was a little bit bland - the cornflake crunch makes it much better! The crack pie soft serve was good, too, but it just tasted like caramel soft serve. Still good, but it didn't quite live up to the hype. I'd come back though to try their other desserts and shakes!\n",

      "0.261156850624 Whenever I read the reviews on a place I like, and consider \"among the Best\", I always feel like I'm having to defend my taste.  You know, you scroll down, lots of 3-stars (fine, but for a place you figure has to be at least a 4)...the occasional near-blan thumbs-down (\"NEVAR AGAIN!\"-types, they're everywhere!)...and thats how I am about Sparks.  By all accounts, this is the best steakhouse in Manhattan, barring debates about the Johnny-come-latelies.  And I feel it deserves this reputation.  Sparks serves truly wonderful steak: steak so good you don't feel rooked for having spent $40 on it.  The sides?  Think I mighta tried 'em, I've heard the creamed spinache is tasty.  Other entrees?  I dunno, I've seen people order the giant lobsters.  Lighter eaters sometimes brave the fish choices (which, I'll admit, are reportadly excellent).  The cocktails are big and meaty.  Oddly, the ice cream here is the best ice cream I've ever tasted.  Seriously, try it.  But remember what you came for: a big, perfect steak.  No, not the filet (ok, ok, I'm sure the filet is wonderful) -- the sirloin, or whatever they call it.  THE steak.  Come here, wear a suit, ask to sit in the Mafia Table if you're feeling frisky.  Steak.  Creamed spinach, perhaps.  Cocktail, or wine.  Vanilla ice-cream.  And wear a suit -- it helps.  Enjoy.\n",

These pieces, combined with rich textiles, Celtic script adorning the walls, and rich, dark wood have shaped an elegant yet inviting atmosphere. You can't find a better place, nor one that's more convenient. The food is good and they serve nice pints. It's right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.

My favorites: seaweed salad, delicately chopped oyster in-the-shell (awesome presentation), and spicy tuna. Parking can be difficult because Covert Avenue is a very busy street, so be sure to park by a meter and put in plenty of quarters - there's hardly any parking on side streets, and if you park in the lots adjacent to Shintaro, chances are you will get towed.\n",

      "0.249150391543 A great local restaurant with very friendly and professional service. Large portions of food, well prepared and presented. Very good sangria too! The pizza was delicious, as was the filet mignon, eggplant parmigiana and the seafood-stuffed tilapia. Low prices and good food will keep me coming back. If the portions were smaller, I'd have tried some dessert. There's always next time. Parking is not the best unless you park a few blocks away, or you can use their valet parking. The restaurant is clean and very nice looking.\n",

The meal was delicious with a generous portion of lobster packed into the roll with a lemon on the side. To give you some reference, you get more lobster than Luke Lobster's roll. All meals come with a side of mixed salad and french fries. Nice touch. I would say it's the second or third best lobster roll I've ever had.\n",

I end my nights out here a lot simply because it's very accommodating and doesn't get too crowded like other places, which makes it great to just chat with friends while winding down.

No reservations needed but always good to make. Perfect for those lunch meetings with clients. You would think its pricey but it's not. Happy Hour tops the cake. Drinks and appetizers are half priced. A Friday night get together with co-workers turns into a night of memories. Every night is different. What gets me more is the setting.. Dim lighted with framed cuban art and posters, and the staff is so friendly and attentive to all your needs. If you visit, ask for Kaczan the manager and tell him Mike from Yelp referred you. He loves to compliment the night with a lil surprise. Enjoy!!!\n",

I guess since it was opening weekend, they had generous samples of a chocolate mousse cake by the register and it was nothing short of heavenly.\n",

      "I purchased a cannelle since I saw them flying out of the case by 4's.  People were ordering boxes of these things!  I'd never had one before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It kind of reminds me of a firm/crispy on the outside bread pudding.  The outside was just the right firmness where it was crispy but not like a cracker and the inside was eggy, rummy, and soft.  At $2.50 each, I'd choose this over a macaron any day.\n",

I would agree with other reviewers that its fantastic that it really tastes like sweet milk instead of 'vanilla'. The flavor has layers and never bores your tastebuds. The crunch just elevates the experience with texture and a matching cereal flavor. Only gripe would be the almost $6 price tag thought it seems all 'fancy' ny soft serve is pricey by serving.\n",

It is definitely as others have described it--old school, in its menu, decor, and service. The service was just alright, and the bread that came out was cold and a bit too hard for my liking. The food, however, was pretty good--I had the gnocchi, which was very good and fresh with average to slightly higher-than-average prices. The small dessert plate at the end of the meal was a nice touch, as well. It's a decent place to eat in the area, but not some place I'd go out of my way to eat.\n",

Both were equally satisfying for my fruity tooth and my endless craving for Italian pastries.

      "Started with the Caesar Salad with Kale and cornbread croutons which was eh.  ($7)  I thought the salad was a little under dressed and I wasn't sure what the Kale was bringing to the party.  I guess they added it to make it \"fusion\"?  Otherwise it would be just an ordinary salad?  I dunno.  The cornbread croutons I thought were a little on the sweet side for this salad as well but it was an interesting contrast.\n",

      "Had the Fried Chicken with the Red Velvet Waffle.  ($16) The fried chicken was good. Fairly moist inside with a good crunchy coating on the outside.  Most of the flavor seemed to be in the coating which leads me to believe the chicken wasn't brined or marinated.  I dunno...something just seemed to be missing that kept it from being amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Velvet Waffle was more like a cake than a waffle.  It lacked that crispy crunchy exterior of a good waffle.  I felt like you had to eat the waffle and the chicken separately as well.  A regular waffle is more neutral in flavor and doesn't compete with the chicken but compliments it.  The red velvet waffle kind of clashed with the chicken imho.\n",

      "Mac and Cheese was really good!  ($6)  Creamy and a really decent size portion - definitely big enough to share.  I really loved the parts that were sort of burnt on top - it gave it a nice crispy texture that paired nicely with the creaminess and richness of the mac and cheese - just wish there was a little bit more of that.  \n",

I've tried just about all of them, the fried eggs prosciutto being my favorite. Their lunch sandwiches are also good, as is their coffee. The rotisserie chicken is delicious, but be sure to call & reserve one before they sell out. They also sell imported Italian specialties like Italian Nutella (yes, there is a difference between that & the American Nutella), pastas and canned San Marzano tomatoes.

Without hesitation, we opted for the latter.  The back room is great, the building is actually single storey back there and there are numerous skylights (which occasionally had a few pigeons sitting on them, which is an odd angle to view a pigeon) and there is even a small courtyard.

What I especially love about this dish, and this restaurant in general - is that they don't overdo it with the garlic!

The Pavia (egg whites, spinach, onion, tomato, and brie) is great with chicken added to it or by itself. It is a huge sandwich, and very filling. The Altan (Mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, basil pesto-yogurt sauce) was a delight as well. The service is fast and friendly, and in an up and coming location. I am addicted to City Sandwich!\n",

Kalbi overpriced and not good.\n",

My four star rating is maybe more my fault than the bar's -a friend and I met there at about 4:45pm on a Friday, at which point the place was absolutely empty. We were the first customers there, and the bartender was pretty awkward about it, half listening to our conversation while half ignoring us. That said, he also recommended that we have the cider, which proved to be an excellent recommendation, since it was delicious. The place also, notwithstanding its emptiness, had a really cool, fun vibe, and was quite reasonably priced. I'd definitely go again, though I'd recommend waiting for a more social time than 4:45pm.\n",

Which is for the best in my book, although I suppose it is slightly less authentic, but no less delicious. The baozi (pork bun) was big and hot, with no stale or starchy aftertaste in the dough, and the filling, while at least 80% like the baozi fillings I've had in Chinatown, definitely seemed a little fresher and healthier. A great joint to have in West Harlem, an easy walk from the 145th st 1 stop.\n",

The menu may not be expansive, but for what it is (mainly hams and cheeses) it has to be the tops in the city. Sitting at the bar it reminded me of what a sushi bar would be if instead of raw fish, soy sauce and ginger you received exquisite ham, cheese, olives and almonds. Combine that with a great selection of Spanish wine and you have the perfect start or end to an evening.\n",

Delivery service can be slow on occasion. Overall one of my favorite grubhub choices.\n",

      "The vodka sauce was a bit thick and a little too sweet for me and I was very disappointed that they had no Italian sausage however, the available proteins (chicken, beef sausage, etc.) were good and fresh.  The other ingredients were good, seemed fresh and full of flavor and weren't overdone.  The crabcake sandwich was very large and for approximately $8, a good deal.  The bread was a touch stale but not offensive, the crabcake seemed to have plenty of lump meat and not full of filler.  Again, not the best crabcake I've had, but quite good for the price.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I still prefer Café Metro, I think they've though through the sauces a bit better and the number of sides for pasta are greater, but Flavor does a good job.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The seating is interesting.  A single, two person table and 6-7 seats that sit at a bar next to the window.  I think there's room for more tables and the single table seemed more like a taunt than helpful.  They should add a few more tables and structure the line so that ordering customers can wind their way around the customers eating.  \n",

The live music was definitely similar to Celtic music but still different. I think it being Scottish really set it apart from places like Kell's in Seattle that I am more accustomed to and thus made it a more enjoyable experience. They had a lot of liquor on shelf and beers on tap. We ordered calamari rings which were pleasantly tasty and not salty like so much fried shit in NYC. The prices were cheap for drinks in Manhattan. A very good place and I would recommend most people to check this place out. I for one will make a stop next time I swing by NYC.\n",

I know pizza, I am Brooklyn born and raised.  This place rocks!!!  I had their regular cheese pizza and the Sicilian square.  They were fantastic.  The sauce was light, sweet and full of robust flavor.  The cheese was fresh and the crust was delightfully thin and cooked to perfection.  In addition, the Sicilian square was thick, with a crunchy crust and a soft cheesey light sauce body.  I was thrilled to be their and enjoyed the experience.  The staff was warm and friendly as I told them that living in the south was wonderful and I love it, but it lacks real pizza.  What it needs is a Joe & Pats.  I highly recommend this pizza place and resturant.  \"Savannah's\" Dr Phil.\n",

It looks pricey, but the desserts are big!\n",

I definitely enjoy sprinkles, magnolia, and susie cakes  much better.  I was only able to finish it because I had a great pairing of wine!  The moscato and lemon tart did go very well together.  It was great to try, but I definitely am not craving to go back.  Props for the creativity, but now I can just do this at home with better cupcakes!  Oh, and yes, my cupcake was a little dry and crumbly, the icing was definitely the winner.  Service, I can't complain, and luckily it wasn't crowded.\n",

The cozy ambiance is created by an elongated room seductively lit and fortified by banquettes served by a charming and friendly staff. Our table of four enjoyed the large selection of creative  roman fare with the following standouts.....grilled  calamari and greens floating on an eggplant puree; tuna tar tare;lobster crepes  bathed by a wonderful creamy tomato sauce. The  flavorful osso bucco was tender and moist; and for the \"cholesterol challenged\" the thick and flaky branzino ,deboned at the table will help keep your eyes off  the osso bucco.The wine list had many affordable choices.  We enjoyed a Sauvignon Blanc and Chianti recommended by our waiter. For dessert my tiramasu was the best I have ever had by far. I will order it again and again(cholesterol be damned) which is saying something, since this foodie is easily bored. I've been to Alto ,Babbo l'impero,Fiamma,etc..

Portion was beyond this hungry guys fill, which meant a late night snack when the buzz wears off those happy hour drinks!  There was nothing \"-ito\" about the Pernilito!

Prices are reasonable for NYC and food is fresh and delicious. I loved the black bean burger on a multigrain bun with several toppings (chipotle habanero mayo!), one of the best veggie burgers I've had.

The six sauces they give you to add on are a nice touch. Great prices on the beer. We had a few beer towers, some food, and rounds of shots going all day which resulted in a surprisingly high split between the 6 or 7 of us so a heads up: it does add up. I'd suggest this place for a bite and beer or two to unwind or for a quick cheap pregame before heading out, its numerous large HD TVs also make it a sweet spot to watch sporting events.\n",

Low irritating hipster quotient, and far enough away from the subway to keep the tourist factor in check. Prices are fair and pours are generous.

There's a jukebox but most of the time I'm there the bartenders are playing an awesome mix of forgotten pop and metal from the early 1980s. By far, the best feature of The Gibson is the windows in the front are open to Bedford Ave, providing the perfect vantage for extended viewing of the open air fashion catwalk. It's a great place to plan your evening of debauchery and it's also a good choice for a quiet unhassled nightcap. Rarely crowded and always chill. \n",

If you have a decent imagination, you could definitely pretend you're in a European oasis sitting by your fountain enjoying your wine and finger foods while chatting with friends. Ventilation/air circulation could be a bit better but it was the hottest friggin' day of the week when we went.  Our bad.\n",

The service was a bit slow and the young man in the truck was a bit too into flirting ( not judging -- just saying).

Surprisingly our expectations were exceeded. The restaurant is in a very long, narrow, deep space.The decor takes advantage of that. We really liked wine stain art along the walls. The cheese puff starters were delicious. We both had the prix fixe menu. Chris had the soup and Diane had the salad. Chris had a glass of the mas de gourgonnier and he had forgotten how much he liked it. Diane had the vegetarian pasta. Chris had the Chicken. Both of us rated our main courses as fantastic. The same fantastic rating went for the dessert. Chris had the Opera coffee sponge cake and Diane had the melon gelato. The service was also excellent.

Worth the minimal effort to drive/walk to; the atmosphere is warm and pleasant and the owners and staff make you instantly feel like family and you belong there. They have a vast bar and coffee menu, but the cool thing about OTB is they host different chefs, music/poetry acts, artist displays, and events daily. Basically, the place is a wonderful local stop but offers different experiences at the same time. Obviously parking is a bit of an issue that you must plan on, but I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area!\n",

The Whole Brook Trout was the best trout I ever tasted! The Risotto had a lot of depth in it and had a great myriad of flavors from chorizo to butternut squash.

      "0.19471649958 A review that I am so far behind on on what is perhaps one of my favorite cocktail bars in the city. I love speakeasies. Absolutely love them. And, there was hardly a reason for why I should not fall instantaneously in love with Little Branch. The entire secretive aspect is one reason, but their expertly crafted cocktails is another. Little Branch is one of my first speakeasy experiences, and my first memory here is a sweet one. I have ventured through many, many bars, and yet, this still remains to be one of favorite secret bars. Though I try to keep it secret, as of late, the popularity has clearly grown. Either way, you will be in for a surprise on your first (and hopefully) many visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "While you can opt for your usual cocktail, or something straight off the menu, Bartender's Choice ($13) should be the one and only option to go with when here. Specify your spirit or type of flavor, and they will masterfully craft a perfect cocktail for you based on your personal preference. Doing otherwise is almost a disservice to yourself. Even without full certainty for what you like, they can make solid recommendations. I have had a fair share of cocktails here, both requested off the menu or Bartender's Choice -- the East Side (Gin-based, tarty), Dominicana (Coffee-based, sweet), Brown Derby (Bourbon-based, sweet and sour), and Don Lockwood (Whiskey-based, smokey). All were amazing cocktail choices here. From sweet to tarty to smokey, I can guarantee they will make you only the most excellent drink based on your personal requests. It is fun to stand by the bar and watch them make cocktails, but for a more intimate experience, you will definitely want to sit in one of their cozy candlelit booths. This is certainly the ideal spot for a date, or an intimate meetup of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the space and atmosphere, it is a true speakeasy experience. An entrance with a discreet sign out front ultimately leads you into a dimly lit, comfortably cozy space that imbues roaring 20s. A bouncer at front will indeed ask for your ID, but otherwise, no passwords required. The seating arrangement is very intimate and perfect for conversation, especially on a more quieter night (which is honestly becoming rare these days, unless you come early). Little Branch is perfect if you are looking for a bit of romance and privacy. Regarding service, it can suffer and slow down a bit when it is a very busy night, which might be the one flaw I am starting to notice on my more recent visits. Overall, I can overlook this. Little Branch still remains one of my favorite speakeasy spots in Manhattan that beats a lot of other spots in the city when it comes down to their cocktails. If you are a serious cocktails connoisseur, please look no further. Note: Cash only.\n",

The omakase plate was very large and diverse in its sampling.  I especially loved the eel.  It was my first time having eel, and I was very impressed.  It was quite tender, melted in the mouth, and had almost a light glaze to it whose taste was worth savoring.  The Toro was very good too, and I was quite happy with the mackerel.

      "0.15467760916 Great neighborhood spot in an area where there is little. We have shopped here for years because they have the best cheese selection on earth and knowledgable staff. When they opened their enoteca we were so excited! It's amazing, good wine and food at really great prices. Perfect for a glass of wine and a snack or a laid back delicious dinner, and then you can get groceries on the way out. Like Eataly, but tiny and neighborhood-y. Worth a stop in!\n",

      "0.153681834614 Great brunch, great service, great price! Can't say enough, this place had definitely become a favorite.\n",

      "0.153376879806 This is a really cute, but dimly lit coffee shop. The seating is limited, but quite comfortable. There are also bar seats should you want to chat with the staff behind the counter. The coffee was great, the ginger cookies were super gingery and very good. There were pieces of ginger throughout the cookie. The staff is super friendly. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood, as this place has a dearth of places to sit and read with a cup of coffee.\n",
