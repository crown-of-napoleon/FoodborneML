      "'08-05-14', 0.001, u'This place is absolute crap. It doesn\\'t deserve a star because it\\'s the definition if being conned in Korea town, but that\\'s not even an option on yelp. Please don\\'t be fooled by the lines. People go here because they seem to think bad quality and rude lacking service is somehow the cool equivalent of roughing it as though you were really in Korea- as though that makes it \"authentic.\" After walking down the K-town row of restaurants I wanted to be a little adventurous and try a new place. I came here for Korean BBQ because it was crowded and seemed busy. Upon entering they pushed us to the back by the bathrooms. It was weird. They took our orders as we were on the line at the back of the restaurant. The manager with her little headset kept telling me to move up on the line not realizing I would be blocking the bathroom for the people who were trying to get by me every couple seconds. You\\'d think if this \\'back of the restaurant line\\' is a regular practice she\\'d know that whoever is standing there needs to leave room for people who have to do their business to pass. Being pushed around by management bad sign #1. From there I was looking at the food people around me were eating as I was on the line and it didn\\'t look so hot. I had a bad vibe and wanted to leave with my friend,but alas we were STUCK. In forced haste by the headset lady, our orders had already been placed. They ask you to order while you\\'re on the back of the restaurant line, so you don\\'t even really get a chance to figure out what you want. So after a ridiculous 30 minute wait in this loud, stinky, crowded to the hilt small restaurant, we were led to our tables. I had ordered traditional beef BBQ. I can genuinely say it was the blandest lowest quality I have ever had the misfortune to pay 35 bucks for. No marinade could save the low quality of this beef. They cooked it on a portable BBQ which looked like it was from the 80s. The waiter was centimeters away from spilling hot grease on my friends foot. Looked down smiled and didn\\'t even clean it up. I wanted to literally get up and leave without paying for the crap we were given. The little Korean appetizers were such a small amount and so lacking in flavor, my friend was laughing from how absolutely horrible everything was and from the look of anger and disappointment on my face. A woman next to me ordered bibimbap that was obviously cold and had been sitting out for a long time. She asked the waiter for a new one. He kept insisting on getting her a new egg. She kept explaining she wanted a NEW one, but he kept pretending to not understand with what seemed like fear for his life. Btw I got a strong feeling that this place doesn\\'t follow labor laws. Anyways, time comes for the check. I honestly had crap service and truly it was the worst meal of my life so I didn\\'t want to give a tip. My friend insisted we should give SOMETHING. Collectively we gave 3 of the supposedly expected 5. The male manager comes up to us and says intimidatingly that the tip is 5 dollars. I tell him tip is optional and that I wasn\\'t happy with service. He takes our receipt goes to the front desk  and literally whacks the receipt to the ground in a fit of rage showing us the door. We happily walk out of that shithole for truly that is what it is.'\n",

      "'08-05-14', 0.003, u\"This place is great, the food is good and it is open 24h!\\nI'm happy I went there before seeing its yelp review because I might not have gone there.\\nIt's pretty crowded so you might have to wait to get seated but even in line they take your order so when you finally get your table, the food comes out right away!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'08-06-14', 0.002, u'I have been coming to this place for over the past 10 years, it has always been a part of my New York experience. It has always been a busy place, trying to accommodate to the rush and high demand of their customers. In the past, their food was what made it worth the wait, but it is no longer worth considering.\\n\\nAlmost every single time I\\'ve been there the experience kicks off by being forced to stand in a line against the wall by the entrance. The line is formed by the exit so you can imagine the congestion and lack of space already. This is phase one. There is a huge traffic jam of people are trying to leave, staff is running around, and people waiting to be seated. Phase two: while I am waiting I am handed a menu and constantly badgered to make a decision so that they can put my order in and have my food ready by the time someone else leaves and a table moves up. Phase three: I am led to the back corner by the bathrooms and forced to hover awkwardly over other customers eating. In order to accommodate to the demand and the high volume of customers, they have taken tables and put a little divider over it in order to serve as many people as possible.\\n\\nFinally after much confusion and waiting, I am seated at my table. My food comes out almost immediately. I order SoonDooBu (seafood tofu) for lunch special. It cannot be considered a \"seafood\" tofu when you are only given one clam and one shrimp in it. The soup base was poorly made, there was a ton of MSG, the vegetables in it were overcooked (the squash was disintegrating). It\\'s almost as if it was just sitting on heat for a long time. My rice was dry. They no longer give service (steamed egg normally). The only redeeming quality of my lunch was the boricha and only because it\\'s not even possible to mess it up. Over the past 10 years, the prices have steadily risen as the quality has exponentially gone down. It is not worth the money for the small portions they give. Over $20 for Korean BBQ? You\\'re so much better off going to H-Mart and grabbing a pack of meat and cooking it yourself. Also, there is definitely something suspicious about the taste of the food...almost like it came from one of those instant packages because my stomach was not happy after that. To wrap up my fine lunch time, the waitress brings me my check before I am even done, a subtle but clear warning that your time is up and you need to leave.\\n\\nThey\\'re currently building a new location across the street so that will definitely eliminate the chaos but who knows if the food will be able to redeem itself. \\n\\nTL;DR: The food, the space, and the atmosphere all suck. Save your money because it is NOT worth the price or the wait or the chaos.'\n",

      "'08-06-14', 0.005, u\"Came here on a Wednesday night. The wait was abt 20 minutes. Very crowded tiny restaurant. Don't come here if u are trying to relax. A waitress in a hurry takes your order while you wait next to a bathroom. Oh well...Much too noisy for any type of civil conversation. The food was so so at best.

This time after FINALLY getting through the line here (have tried twice before without success) I decided to be adventurous and went for the seafood tofu soup. The broth was delicious and had an ample amount of seafood and tofu. I think the tofu could be better, and it was store bought for sure. I have had tofu at Korean places in Toronto where they make their own tofu and believe me there is a difference. They do have great kimchi and other starters and in good portions too which I really appreciated.\\nMy friend got the seafood pancake, which was good but way too oily for my taste. Next time \\nThe whole place is an experience, squashed against the wall and ordering while waiting in line for the table definitely brought back memories of trips to Asia.  food looked freshly prepared. \\nGoing back? For sure. But sticking to Bibimbap next time :) I think it'll make this place a 5*.\"\n",

      "'08-11-14', 0.001, u\"I usually go to the Kun Jip in Palisades Park but last weekend I was in the city and decided to give this place a try with my friends. I was surprised to see so many people eating at 4:30am. We were a party of 6 and we were seated right away at a table. I thought the prices were slightly more than the usual but I guess it's because we're in NYC. It was $16.95 for the bibimbap+jjigae combo. \\nThe more important thing was that when we ordered and asked for specific things to be left out (been sprouts/carrots/etc.) they actually did this correctly. I found myself sometimes frustrated when we order things and say someone has an allergy but they still bring the dish with those ingredients. \\nOther than that I didn't see anything spectacular about the side dishes. There were 2 types of kimchi, spinach, bean sprouts, fishcake, eggjjim(?). Just your typical side dishes. \\nWe waited for a good 10minutes for someone to bring us our check but no one did. So one of us had to get up, go to the front and get our bill. Oh yeah, they also have a min of $20 if you want to use credit cards. This kind of made it awk for us because all of us ordered the $17 and couldn't pay with our cards. \\nOverall, unless there are no other places open at 4:30am on a saturday night, I probably won't be back here again. (at least this one in NYC). I just wanted to eat and get home but everything took slightly too long.\"\n",

We had to wait about 30 min, but it was a Saturday night and they don't take reservations, so that really wasn't bad at all. The service was great once we got to our table.\\n\\nMeatball appetizer - This is my friend's favorite, and it did not disappoint. It comes with three meatballs in a delicious tomato sauce with bread. Absolutely delicious.\\n\\nBurrata appetizer - This was a special that came with walnuts. It was extremely fresh and delicious.\\n\\nQueen pizza with sausage - This is what my friend always loves to get, and it was amazing. The crust is so good - it's soft and chewy, and the toppings were also delicious. I loved it. \\n\\nI would go back to Milkflower in a second, and would love to try more of the menu.\"\n",

      "'02-10-15', 0.001, u\"I've had this type of 'fancy' 'wood-fired' pizza a few times now and have been kind of disappointed by it. I avoided Milkflower for while because of all the hype but now that I've been I can say for certain that it's definitely worth a visit. We walked in for a Sunday brunch and we got the Abe Froman (for the meat) and the lady got the Arugula. \\n\\nI was getting ready to not like it, with the price of the pizza being a little higher than I wanted. My tune changed quickly though when the pizza came. I imagined that the Froman-would have a scattering of meat under the guise of 'gourmet' but I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza had a good balance of sausage with the other topics and definitely not on the skimpy side of topping placement. The arugula was also a good choice which had a little bitterness and crispness of the slightly uncooked arugula and the speck provided a nice counterpoint to it.\\n\\nProbably the best 'fancy' pizza place I've been to so far.\"\n",

I usually gag at truffle oil, but it's used very sparingly and adds that extra note of richness that makes the pie that much more special.\\n\\nI also love the spicy soppressata (they add honey! so perfect!), the abe froman, and was completely surprised and delighted by the superfly snuka (jalapeno + pineapple, can't believe that works!)\\n\\nNot only are the toppings inventive, delicious and thoughtful, the crust is just so great.  Chewy, crisp, with just enough char... I can't rave enough about this pizza.\\n\\nWe also tried the meatball app, which was good, but I have to say the real star for me was the sauce the meatballs sit in!

We ordered these delicious shishito peppers as a small plate and then we got the stun dunn pizza-- which was basically a vegetarian option.  We loved the pizza-- the crust was thin and soft-- the outer edges were thicker and had risen more than a regular thin crust pizza.  We had the gelato at the end of the meal.  The chocolate kind was in the bowl for about 1 minute-- while the strawberry and rose petal kinds went a little more slowly.  \\n\\n I wish they had different salad options-- perhaps they'll change their menu every now and then.

Didn\\'t read the reviews but saw they were all 4-5 stars so I told my friend to try them today. We got there around 4:15 and they were closed. They reopened 5:00. Whatever would we for for 45 mins in that area lol. We drove to Juniper Park for a walk and drove back at 5:00. \\n\\nThere was a family dining there when we returned.

The waiter came immediately with menus while we chose where we wanted to sit and asked what type of water we wanted. He asked if we were familiar with Thai food and what told us their specialties. Also recommended the Phuket Sampler which we ordered. For entrees we got beef pad see ew and chicken red thunder fried rice. \\n\\nSampler was small compared to other samplers I\\'ve had. Came with two pieces each of spring rolls, firecracker shrimp, steamed dumplings, and jade curry puffs. The spring rolls need to be filled with more filling, firecracker shrimp pretty good but lacks something, steamed dumplings were good, and jade curry puffs were my fave but were teeny. Their curry puffs were practically dumpling size. Significantly smaller than other curry puffs I\\'ve had. \\n\\nPad see ew pretty good, but felt the noodles were just a bit \"stiff\". The fried rice was very good and different from what I\\'ve had. Also felt the rice was a little dry. Other than that, the taste was pretty solid. Again, portion on the small side.

      "'09-09-15', 0.003, u\"My son and I were really hungry around 9 pm and this place was on our way home from the mall. I've wanting to check the place out as few of my friends posted visit to there on Facebook and raved about it. I was impressed at first look. It was memorial Monday and they were pretty busy. As soon as we walked in, someone greeted us and asked us to wait a minute as they were putting setups on the only empty table at that moment.\\n\\nThey have a good size menu, lots of options to choose from. As for my son, it left him confused to have to choose one or two from such a large menu according to him. He ended up ordering Tum yum seafood soup and spicy basil chicken. I asked the waitress whether to go for tilapia or salmon, she suggested teriyaki salmon and I went with that. We waited for a while and our food came but got no soup. I asked the person serving that we had a order of soup. He apologized and said he will go look. I asked him not to worry, we will skip on the soup. He came back after a minute and apologized few more times and offer a bowl of soup on the house. We decided not to get the soup as we were already into our meal. Half way through our meal, my son kept reaching for water as he found his dish to be too spicy. I tasted some of his food and found it to be fine. We got the menu again and ordered pad Thai noodles for him. The waitress took our order and came back again to ask what kind of meat would he like on it. I wish she would have pen and paper when taking orders. Maybe then she wouldn't forget our soup and what kind of meat we want.\\n\\nDespite missing on the soup and not taking order properly, I would have to say that the wait staff were really courteous and nice. Everyone spoke with a smile. When we asked the busboy that we want to take our leftovers home, he quickly took our plates and packed them up.\\n\\nAs for the food, I got to try both the dishes my son had and I would say that they are better than your average Thai restaurant. My teriyaki salmon was really good. The place it not very pricy and I think that will give them a lot of customers. I am not a big fan of dark decor or dark environment, I like places to be bright (and I know it's hard to come by in terms of restaurants). If dark is your thing, you might like the atmosphere. I would recommend my friends and family to go check it out. And I will probably go there again as it is only about 15 mins drive from my house.\"\n",

Of course prior to arriving I called to let them know there was a party of four coming just in case it was really busy. ;) fortunately it wasn't exactly brimming with customers after 9:30pm but just enough people. \\nThe decor is pretty nice (although purple isn't exactly  my favorite color especially for a restaurant). We ordered a few appetizers such as the firecracker shrimp, spring rolls and papaya salad. It was decent. The papaya salad was actually better than expected.   Their non-alcoholic drink menu is pretty on point. The Thai tea was good. My sister and mom had the mock mojitos and I totally forget the name of my dad's drink but it had berries. Everyone was happy........ Now on to the Entrees!\\n\\nOrder= \\nRama Duck- \\nCrispy duck with a sweet peanut sauce and jasmine rice. It was probably the best dish. If you don't like too much sauce be sure to have the waiter take note as it does come with a lot.\\n\\nLamb with Massaman glaze- \\nthe lamb was super tender and juicy. The sauce was pretty darn good....until I got to the potatoes. They tasted a bit off, maybe even sour. I made sure to tell my waiter as well as the guy whom is the owner/manager.

The toppings for the Rocky Road favorite combination wasn't mixed too well, but that's all right because it would have turned to a sticky soupy mess if the worker mixed it more. But I have to give their award-winning double chocolate ice cream props, because it is so deliciously amazing. And I'm not even a fan of chocolate ice cream! The pistachio flavor was disappointing, sadly. The taste was very synthetic with A LOT of sugar. \\n\\nI miss those days back in the 90s when Carvel made pistachio ice cream with actual pistachio nuts. Gone are the days when food was made with wholesome ingredients. Now everything is just natural and/or artificial flavors added.\"\n",

When we finally got our food, the waitress messed up the orders for 3 people in our party delaying them from fully enjoying their meals. It is also worth mentioning that the only thing memorable about the food was that it was cold and it took over an hour to come out - the same time it took for us to get our drinks. Then, when someone in our party complained that they did not like the chicken because it was dry and asked for a different dish the waitress snapped and said, \"the kitchen is closed\". That was the official moment that I was over this place. Why wasn\\'t our party ever greeted properly by the waitress? Why weren\\'t we told that the kitchen was closing prior to the kitchen closing? We weren\\'t even able to order a dessert and sing happy birthday to my cousin because she didn\\'t inform us that the kitchen was closing. It wasn\\'t until I vocalized these issues that the waitress ran to the back to get the \"kitchen manager\" who said, \"we don\\'t inform guest that the kitchen is closing. We close at 11pm.\" After all of this, a busboy comes over to our table to tell us that his coworkers are racist and we were well in our right to complain because they treat minority customers poorly at this particular restaurant.

I couldn't get over how tasty they were.... all I remember of childhood is that they were so bitter, nothing but bitter...... so this was a VERY welcome surprise.  Turkey was moist, all the sides had flavor.  The only downer, and a minor one at that, was that it came out bordering on cool in temperature.  I sent it back, and they brought me a new plate that was much warmer.  My husband ordered short ribs (of all things) for his Thanksgiving dinner (*rolling eyes*).  I can't say I understand that, but it's a free country, and he chose what he wanted.  No, I didn't taste it..... I refused.  It was Thanksgiving.

It wasn't my choice for dinner; I deferred to the group of seven I was traveling with.\\n\\nHowever, I was excited when I read on the menu that they offered housemade pasta. I rarely have the chance to enjoy fresh pasta, so that was clearly the choice for us that night! I offered for my husband to choose which dish & he went with the Penne Alla Vecchia Bettola: crushed tomato, prosciutto, asparagus, garlic, cream, parmesan & a splash of vodka. Sounds delightful, right? When we realized that this dish was also an option on the prix fixe menu, we opted for that. For an additional $7, we received a glass of house wine & an appetizer. It was a no brainer. \\n\\nThe small braided rolls brought to the table were rather hard & forgettable. Our server was none too generous either: one for each of us (7) in the basket.\\n\\nOut came our calamari appetizer. It's an infrequent occasion that I order anything fried, so when I suggested this to my husband, he was surprised but, as a sweet husband does, obliged to my request. The calamari was good, not great. It was a mix of tubes & tentacles, which I like. But they lacked that crisp bite one expects from well-prepared calamari. In addition, the marinara sauce for dipping lacked any seasoning. Another disappointment. \\n\\nI'm sure the fresh pasta will redeem it all!\\n\\nNot. The bowl was small, which wasn't terribly surprising since we opted for the prix fixe portion. I took a bite &, while it tasted fine, it was far from fresh pasta. Seriously? Urgh. I decided to forego questioning this in front of our group, but approached the manager when we left that evening. I asked about the menu's claim of fresh pasta & he replied that the housemade pastas are the lasagne, fettuccine & occasionally, tagliatelle. The fresh options are noted on the menu with an asterisk. All of the others are dried De Cecco pasta. I told him how I thought this was misleading & should be made more clear on the menu. He was kind & responded by saying he would try to think of a way to re-do that portion of the menu. I thanked him, but no bother. It was a quick stay in NY for us this time & knowing the other food we had here wasn't that memorable, I won't be back when we do return. There are far too many 4 & 5 star options to try!\"\n",
