It was late, around 11, but I didn't think anything of it since they said the kitchen was still open. Also I had to eat something since I didn't get a chance to eat dinner. I got the Mac and cheese and went home to eat it. It tasted a little funny but I didn't think any thing of it since it was literally just Mac and cheese. Long story short I wake up at 4 am puking on and off for the next 6 hours. I literally have never felt so bad in my life. I had the hot and cold chills, I couldn't even bare to look outside since I had a headache and my eyes were sensitive to the light (prob from dehydration since I can't keep any water down) I've never had food poisoning before but believe me it's NO joke. Whatever they prepped my food on must have been contaminated. I'll never go back here again. I'm very disappointed with this cute little place.\n",

The food is laughable as well I understand the food is not the main attraction for this place but no amount of saki bomb is worth getting food poisoning again. Oh and their saki is basically watered down nothing and you have to beg them to warm it up even a little.

It has so much salt in it, it was literally enough to gag a person. Most of the party refused to eat it and few continued on, but there wasn't much to be had since 2/3 of the pot was unopened mussels meaning they were beyond dead before being cooked posing a food poisoning threat, so most of it was left uneaten and the rest that were edible required multiple glasses of water to wash down the immense amount of salt. \n",

We were sat 1.5 hours after our reservations that we made weeks in advance. The staff was rude at every interaction topped with the manager who makes cab drivers seem polite. I wouldn't employ this staff at a McDonald's; just complete incompetence. The food was pedestrian at best and inedible in some cases. The icing on the cake was the food poisoning the next day. Just disgusting on every level, avoid at all costs.\n",

      "The food was awful and the portions were very small. The worst French food that I have ever had. We started with the mussels (they were mediocre). Most give a giant pot, but they gave us the smallest little dish I have ever seen. I got the halibut, which was dry and flavorless and had sauce on the side that obviously didn't complement the fish. I am by no means a chef, and if given the raw ingredients used to make my food that night, I believe that I could have done a better job, which is sad. My boyfriend got the coq au vin, which was bland and mediocre at best. The service was okay. It was my birthday dinner and I was expecting much better from a pricy French restaurant. They need to hire a new chef asap!!!\n",

I was starving so I sorted my Seamless options by closest distance, and this is one of the top 5. After I placed my order, an hour goes by. I called and asked about the status of the order. Like another reviewer on Seamless mentioned, the lady tells me, \"he left.\" I quickly asked, \"how long ago?\" She says, \"I don't know, maybe 5-8 mins.\" I then thanked her and hung up the phone.\n",

I have totally forgotten about my meal by now until I heard a doorbell. Needless to say, I got yelled at over the phone, received my food half an hour past estimated delivery time (that is, over an hour from ordering), and got food poisoning as a result of all this. After this experience, I will be sure never to order here again. Leave the Mexican food to the Mexicans, please!\n",

Big mistake. Firstly, there was a lady by the pizzas and I asked her if this is margarita (I am vegetarian), she said \"i dont know. it is what it is\"j. Anyway, i ordered a slide of margarita and they took one slice from their pre-made pizzas and warmed in the oven. They gave the pizza on a paper plate. Well that slice cost me $6. it is way too much overpriced to loot the tourists in the times square area.\n",

We were excited and decided to do the full tasting menu. However, it did not end well as we both had food poisoning that affected plans for the rest of our NYC visit. I even contacted the restaurant because it was so disappointing to get food poisoning from a Michelin star restaurant let alone on our anniversary. They only followed up with calls during inconvenient work day hours and never cared to followed up otherwise. Should have just gone to Per Se again where they have impeccable unmatched service...\n",

I ended up not wanting to eat it as I was afraid of getting food poisoning before my exam later that evening. He handled money without washing hands, then proceeded to touch the fritters , pizza slices and rice balls with his BARE HANDS. He rearranged them multiple times while I stood there with a friend waiting for my food, who also was in shock.  I am not sure if it was only the guy that was there today that does this but that was really disgusting.  \n",
