"We had a party of 18 people for Easter dinner yesterday.  We were seated in a very overcrowded dining area with 1 long table so that we couldn't speak to anyone at the other end at all.  It was so packed, they put up a tent outside so that they could accommodate more people, I should have known that it would be a problem since the kitchen and wait staff were still the same and not equipped to handle the masses.  We had the most obnoxious waiter, Peter, he was abrupt and in a hurry and we felt like we couldn't make an informed decision about our menu choices.  He pushed appetizers on us without us even looking at the menu, he was acting like a big shot - ""who's in charge here?  You want me to do platters for the table..."" The apps came out fast, however, we waited and waited for the rest.  Some of us got the set Easter menu which was a 4 course meal for $36.95 - the first course was a choice of soup, we got half empty dishes of soup, some had more than others served room temperature.  The bread was gone and never replaced, one of the guests didn't get his meal until the rest of us were finished and when he did, it was cold.  I got the lamb which was sliced so thin and was fatty, I had to cut most of it away.  It was pre-cooked and dipped in juice to moisten and served.  I went home hungry.  Then when it was time for dessert, obnoxious Peter re-surfaced (he was gone most of the 4 hours that we were there) and told us he would do a platter of the desserts that came with the pre-fixe so everyone could share.  You know what he did instead?  He brought out a variety (without asking us what we wanted) of sliced cake on individual plates and just spread them out across the very long table.  He was so obnoxious, did I say that already?  Oh and in the beginning of our day, we asked him for 3 separate checks so it would be easier for us when we had to pay, he told us not to worry about it now, we will do it at the end.  That turned into another fiasco.  He divided the checks the way he thought they should be and the audacity to include his tip in all of them, we had him redo them because they weren't correct, and while we were standing with him at the register, half way through he threw up his hands and said he couldn't ""do this no more"" and walked away and had the manager Nina come and take over.  She was very nice about it with us, but it didn't make up for a horrible Easter meal/service.  Peter even tried to switch a receipt on us for a higher one, because he forgot to include his tip in it!   The nerve!   I have been going out to restaurants for Easter for 10 years, we try different places all the time, I have never had such a horrible experience.  Then to end the 4 hour long ordeal (the menu stated 1 1/2 hour seating please ....Ha!) while I was waiting on the valet to get my car, another family were waiting also, and one of the men started projectile vomiting right there in front of the place!   How very apropos!  Then the next day, my cousin called me to tell me that they switched our credit cards, she was charged for our meals and we were charges for hers!   I owe her $90.


P.S. - My cousin called the restaurant the next day to talk to the owner who she knows casually and instead of apologizing and trying to make it right, he said that he never got a complaint and that we were rude to them!   Will never return, Ciao Uncle Bacala!   You will not see the likes of us again, and I will tell anyone who will listen not to patronize your pitiful excuse of a restaurant.",1.0
"Several years ago I was very sick and searching for the best source of chicken pho I could find that wasn't too far from my house. I saw a review for Gia Lam and went, requesting a chicken pho that's made with chicken broth. It was delicious then and I'm happy to say it's still delicious now. The chicken is cooked in a way that comes out moist and savory that's just delicious (I rarely eat meat but for this when I'm sick I make an exception). My roommate loved her beef pho as well and we both thought our coffees with condensed milk were delicious. The server also was super sweet and the place was full of locals by the time we left which is always a good sign.",1.0
"Maybe it depends on what you get but I have explored a lot on this menu and have never been disappointed.  It is perfect for me on a lazy Sunday with great breakfast and lunch options, great shakes and when I was sick with stomach issues I ordered soups, salad, and jello.  I agree quality has gone down a bit, prices up-but not significant enough for this to be a top 5 seamless spot for me and my family.",1.0
"Yummy Sushi is not yummy and the falafel made me feel awful. The California roll was the smallest I've ever seen. 6 pieces the size of quarters. My daughter was still hungry. The falafel pita was tiny and disgusting. The falafel was green and smelled strongly of fish. It had chucks of tomato, lettuce and lots of dill pickle slices. The smell of the fish and pickles made me sick to my stomach. Couldn't eat it. The only good thing was the tempura vegetables, but only slightly. There were 2 slices of sweet potato and 3 slices of eggplant. The tempura batter and dipping sauce were delicious, but not enough to redeem this mess of a dinner. More than $20 and we're still hungry. 2 thumbs down from us.",1.0
"I will give the food a 3 star really. Its nothing special at all however its decent.

My real gripe is that I just left there and I am having the worst stomach pains in years. I generally don't get sick eating almost anything but I am not sure if its how the food was handled or preparation but something went terribly wrong. Again food didn't taste bad but I am having the worst night in a long time. I can only point towards the food. Sorry, I won't be back.",1.0

"i was under the impression that this was a nice place boy was i wrong i ordered i platter for the nursing staff at Mt. Sinai as gift for looking after me while i was sick 

the manager was very nice in taking my 120.00 dollars and everything went downhill from there 

1st i asked for them to email me a picture of what i paid for it never happened 

2nd when it was time for the delivery the delivery guy kept calling me about the pick up and not the nursing department 

3rd when they finally delivered the platter the delivery guy harassed the nursing staff for a tip 

lastly, when i called to speak to the manager about my issues i was told Fuck You and  hung up on

"We hosted a corporate event in their event room and the heat was unbearable.  We begged the manager to turn on the air conditioning, and they never did.  We disappointed our clients and had two customers feel so sick we almost called an ambulance.  The food was okay, but for the chaos that was involved and heat of venue, not to mention a poor AV situation with an ancient projector, we will never book another event here.  Look elsewhere for any event that involves a private room.",1.0
I don't like this place and the customers. So much cigarette buds on the sidewalk and someone getting sick on the sidewalk. So annoying.  Please go somewhere else.,1.0
I had ate there twice. To me the food there is tasty but every time returning home I get Diarrhea from the broth. The meats are pricy and dinner charges are even more expensive  than lunch. It's not like no other hot pot but just vegetables.,1.0
"Consistently ill-cooked burgers delivered and when told they did it wrong they push back. I had to take my burger in to get resolution, and even then they acted like they were doing me a favor. Got so sick of their attitude I demanded my money back. This is when the manager told me I had no right to demand anything.

What's most aggravating is how often I've eaten in the restaurant with no problem. Because they didn't see my face, they thought they could push me around like I was just some unhappy customer bothering them. 

Never going back because of their poor customer service and how they resolve wrongly cooked food. This is not how to run a business.

And when they sent me my money back, they sent it without including the tip for the delivery guy. I think that's my decision to make, not the manager's.",1.0
"$3 rolls, $3 beers, $3 appetizers happy hour got me in the door. I had the Kani salad, spicy salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll, and California roll. I would be happy just not get food poisoning for $3 sushi rolls but they were actually very good. They were lacking the flare, aesthetics, and the fresh wasabi you would get at other places. This is excused for their cheap prices.",1.0
"The food was too salty, I had been sick for 2 days. The service is ok. Apparently there are lot of reviews about the salty food but it does not change anything!",1.0
"If I could give it a zero I would, got a English muffin with black mold on  it.  I threw up in my mouth a little bit lol.  Guy who made it offered me another one but I was sick to my stomach.",1.0
"Let's put it this way: it's exactly what you'd expect by looking at it... Should you find yourself here, maybe you should find a dealer who will meet you at your apartment, or try an escort service in lieu of the stroll. Yeah - it's crazy sketch up in here. We all had burgers for lunch and the 2 other tables (at 11 AM) were just drinking Bud tallboys and talking trash - I have no problem with that, but it made a daunting experience slightly more surreal.) Look - there was nothing ""good"" about the food - it tastes exactly like you think it's going to when you look at the outside of the building - kind of like you know what you're about to encounter before you open the door of a porto-potty. But if you're cool with peeing into cold plastic in the dark, then go for it. I guess the best thing I can say is ""I didn't get sick... or shot.""",1.0
"I always said I would never serve fried chicken at my dinner table (mother never served or cooked fried chicken for dinner) but OMG, if I knew how to make fried chicken in this manner, I would be plagued with obesity and whatever other sickness could come from eating fried chicken EVERY-SINGLE-DAY! 

I really wished their waffle tastes like something, anything, I mean a hint of chocolate would be nice but nope... Simple waffle that's red. How about adding white chocolate in the batter or coco for favor?!?! 

I'm watching you SoCo and once I taste my idea in your waffle, I want my cut!!!! Lol

Oh and if staff is in one of their 'moods', stay home! Our server look like someone pinched his butt really hard and he was done with the entire world afterwards. Lol",1.0
"HORRIBLE AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  I ordered from them the day before and the service wasn't that bad so I did it again today on Sunday.  I ordered a simple orange juice and omelet.  They didn't deliver the orange juice so i called up just informing and asking if i can cancel.  Right away the girl said she'd have' him' talk to me, didn't explain why just shoved some guy on the phone.  Right off the bat he was nasty and when i asked him not to speak or raise his voice to me, he claimed he did it because i was...which i wasn't (and trust me that's rare for me).  I then asked for his name and he refused claiming he didn't have to tell me. I am so disgusted i can't even eat the omelette they DID send me.  Avoid this place, they are nasty, they don't care about their customer and they will use sick excuses like claiming you are being nasty to them for them to be nasty to you.  AVOID AVOID AVOID! I will make sure I never order from ANY of the Europa Cafes if this is the type of disrespect they allow in their establishment.",1.0
"I've received food poisoning once from their cooked food and was sold a rotten fish once. They wouldn't give me a refund. I started showing their customers what they sold me, and eventually they refunded the money. This place is run by crooks. Enough said. I've never gone back. The service is always dismal. They opened a store called meat heaven a block away. I've been shopping here ever since. They always greet you with a smile and have fresh products.",1.0
"I can't figure out why the high ratings at this store maybe it's because of the convenience of being so close to the 116th 6 Stop (which is the ONLY reason I myself have stopped in). I feel sorry for the people who only shop here because they are pumping their bodies with GMO's, pesticides, and sugar and fat. The only thing redeemable about this store is the fact they have a small juice bar so if/when you catch it open this is probably the best thing even though it's conventional or gmo produce. The store is expensive and for a middle income community forced to shop there I found this sad. Even some grocers will carry a small albeit poor selection of organic or non/gmo food but this store has virtually none. Their produce is very high too. Save yourselves walk 2 blocks west to Fine Fare or stop at Trader Joe's and get affordable produce. Really $3 for 3 apples (gmo) and $6 for a honeydew melon, they cost much less than that at Trader Joe's? I believe this store is all about the major chains and how it sickens and ruins people, charge out the ass for things you can get elsewhere for much cheaper. They can keep their Campbell's, Kellogg's, and Kraft products because I don't consume those cancer ridden foods and families shouldn't either.",1.0
Super strong margaritas! Pace yourself though because one is enough! I got the seafood enchiladas as well and they were tasty and service was friendly and quick. I did feel a bit sick after the meal so I am not sure if it was that one margarita or the food. But not a bad spot for tex mex and quite a lively vibe.,1.0
Not a review about food but what happened yes the food is good and some of the people there are really nice this has to do with I don't know how many owners this place has but the owner / manager there this easter sunday. I did not want to cook so I thought let me go here to get something to eat I have a lot to say but I will try to keep it short after my food was finally done the manager / owner I don't know his name got my order proceeded to bag my food in a paper bag but stopped since one of the waitress / server started talking to him finally after she stopped talking he finally started to finish bagging my order not with a new plastic bag but a bag that was already on the counter when I came in around 11:40 am I didn't mind too much but I kept my mouth shut but what made me mad was after he put my order in the plastic bag he coughs right on both bags to me this is disgusting and disrespectful I am always respectful when I come here after seeing this I still kept my mouth shut and just said thank you and all I got in return was an attitude when I got outside I took out my order of food from the bags he cough on and the foil tray the food was in was not properly covered and almost fell out on to the sidewalk cause I did not want to get sick so I put it in one of the bags I got from the grocery store the point of my review is people are disrespectful to other's by not covering their mouth's when they cough and sneeze and in return other's get sick I have multiply health issues when I get sick it takes a long time for me to get better I don't know if he did this on purpose if so that was wrong because people that work there know me and know I am always respectful this has taught me a lesson I am too damn nice and respectful but now I feel I should stop being the way I am and start being disrespectful,1.0
"The only item I've tried here is one of the breakfast wraps to go, which tastes really good.

However, the staff here do not inspire confidence in the safety of the food at all, in terms of their grooming and hygiene.  A lot of them have multiple facial piercings, tattoos, all kinds of weird haircuts, beards, etc.  Nothing wrong with any of that--if you work at a video store--but at an establishment that serves food?  No thanks. 

The last two times I went in, I walked right back out--the first time, about five employees were all standing around doing nothing, either having a discussion with each other, or checking their phones, and one was biting his nails.  Nobody even looked up when I walked in.  

The next time, the guy behind the counter was massaging his long goatee right over the counter.  Yuk.  This dude is going to touch my food after that?!  Don't think so.  Neither time was I greeted or welcomed in any way.  

I understand it must be hard to find qualified workers willing to work for low wages, but that's not my problem.  I am a paying customer who would like to avoid getting sick.  This place needs better management.",1.0
"SO OVERPRICED! I came here on a whim and will not be back. $12 for a pretty small burger and $1 extra for CHEESE! Who charges extra for cheese? Would rather make the long walk to shake shack where the burgers are better and they don't charge extra for the cheese. I also felt sick after eating the burger, so something tells me the meat wasn't cooked right...",1.0
"I was quite hungry and after checking out the menu I went with the titled, ""A great steak sandwich.""  I received a ""not great at all steak sandwich.""  The only thing you can taste when you eat this sandwich is the unclean grill.  I couldn't taste the meat, the blue cheese, the caramelized onions, arugula or bread.  Seemed like a no brainer that this sandwich would be great and easily loved with these ingredients.  But burnt residue from a clearly unclean grill trumped all those great ingredients.  Also served with the steak sandwich is a bacon potato salad, which again sounds great, but the bacon was so undercooked I wondered if it was cooked at all.  It looked exactly how bacon looks when you pull it out of the package.  Hoping I don't get sick, having just left there.  The bartender was very sweet an attentive but the meal was so unsatisfactory I felt compelled to let the yelp community know.",1.0

"The worst coat checking experience ever in my life. I lost my ticket for the coat and the checker would not give out coat back even though we took the picture of the tickets. We have three coats checked but only mine is lost. Even though we present the two tickets to the checker, they still didn't buy that we three are together. The worst part is that after we decided to wait for the party over and got our coat back, we have been told with different time when we should come back to get the coat. First is 5 am then changed to 6 am then changed to after 12 pm and then 5:30 then 6:30 finally they confirmed that it's 10 pm. Basically we wasted out whole day to get our coat back in such a cold day. Btw my friend got sick and fell in the slippery bathroom. So the party is great to be fair but the experience is awful.",1.0
"This place is filthy! I ordered from here once and soon after I was throwing up. It became nonstop and I went to the emergency room, turns out I contracted H Pylori. Which is a stomach bacteria you get from infected saliva, feces or vomit. I'm assuming someone spit in my food or didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom. Which is disgusting!!! 

I had to put one star because I had no other choice but I wish they would close this place down

I will be reporting them to the board of health. 
Do not eat here!-",1.0
First of let's start by saying that we sat down outdoors and the table given to us was dirty and stained. They didn't change the table cloth even after I complained about it. The gentlemen who was attending us was nice but the fact that he basically recommended plates for us because it was our first time without thinking that we were only 2 upsets me. He gave us a platter of sushi samples that can feed a group 5-7 people. The sushi didn't taste fresh it also got me and my friend sick. The environment was nice but the food experience were horrible.,1.0
"My first impression sums in one word - boring. But than I found it also to be insulting and condescending. The onion soup was bearable but then came a salmon that my wife ordered and the chicken with fries that I had. There was nothing French about these dishes aside of the French accent of the waiter. Hienz ketchup bottle like a soldier in red stood silent to morn the fries that were long gone before they were brought to our table for burial. What can I add about the crepe Suzette that I had for dessert, simply bad.
To sum this dinner event we rolled from side to side in our bed at night keeping ourselves from vomiting. Seriously, this place gave a new meaning to ""bad food""",1.0

"I was craving Sichuan food and decided to order from here since the reviews on Yelp seemed like it was decent.I ordered the egg drop soup, scallion pancakes, mapo tofu and the sauteed spicy aromatic shrimp. The overall experience was painful and disgusting.The soup was bland and was not cooked long enough that all the ingredients tasted raw and the liquid was gooey. The scallion pancakes were OK but did not have enough flavor to them. The mapo tofu was delicious and the tofu tasted fresh. The worst dish was the sauteed aromatic shrimp which was mouth numbing experience. The color of the dish was brown and looked over cooked. My boyfriend and I were so hungry at that point thatwe decided to give it a go. The minute we ate this our mouths started to go numb and the taste was as if they had poured gasoline in the dish. I understand some of it might be the spice but I've had enough Sichuan style food that I know what it should taste like. After we ate this, our bodies started to tingle and we felt nausea for about 4 hours. I looked up these symptoms and it's the case of over using MSG. There was SO MUCH MSG used in this dish that my body had a reaction to it instantaneously. I called the restaurant and the lady was nice enough to credit us but what rubbed me the wrong way was that she insisted that it was my first time trying this dish and that I had nothing to compare it by. I've let her know that I've had enough Sichuan food to understand the deeply rooted flavors but nothing should numb the mouth and gives your body a nauseous reaction. This could also be a case of a dirty kitchen and staff who may not have cleaned their ingredients properly. I really had high expectations for this place, but I will never go back after this experience. I understand in NY, most restaurants use MSG but this was a case of over using and making a customer very sick.",1.0
"Food is great in concept. I have been wanting to go here for several months, but we haven't had the time. 

Our first and only visit: Food looked great & staff was amazing. But, I found a hair in my food, and our whole family has been sick ever since we ate lunch there. Hopefully it was just an ""off"" day for the kitchen staff...",1.0
"I went with my husband yesterday July 31st, 2015 for the first time and LAST!
I had as a main course the GRILLED BRANZINO (Olive Oil Crushed Potatoes, Spring Vegetable Salad, Grilled Lemon). When the dish arrived to the table it didn't smelled very good, but I thought I was mistaken....I added extra lemon and ate it....by 2:20 am I felt so sick that I had to run to the bathroom to throw up!

I am so upset that even though I feel sick I couldn't wait until tomorrow to write a review!

A terrible service, awful food and a 200$ dinner!
We will never comeback!

"I had always wanted to try this place and a couple of my girlfriends and I were looking for a last minute spot on a Friday night in midtown for dinner.  Both had previously been to Brasserie for lunch and said it was pretty good.  This turned into one of the worst dining experiences any of us have ever had.  I want to preface this review with the fact that I own a food service establishment in NYC myself and dine out nearly 3-4 nights a week so am very familiar with the NY restaurant scene.  This place HAS to be on EATER'S death watch!

We walked into a mostly empty restaurant around 7:30pm.  Everyone dining was a minimum of 65 years old.  The decor was awkward, probably cool in 1959 when it opened but now just dated and bad.  I literally felt like I was in a weird time warp, even everyone's suits looked dated.  The bar was nearly empty as well.  We sat at a table and had a moment of ""should we leave""?  We should have but decided to give it a try.

We were told that a couple of the menu items we were eyeing were unavailable for the night which was disappointing.  We had to ask for an exception when we were also told we couldn't enjoy the $1 oyster happy hour special unless we were seated at the bar.  We ordered two dozen Oysters, the Tuna Tartare, the Frisee Au Lardons Salad, and the Field Greens Salad to start.  When the oyster tower arrived they smelled extremely fishy.  Not being an oyster eater myself I had to switch seats with my friend because the fishy smell was too strong being that close to me.  The Tuna Tartare was ok but had a fishy aftertaste.  The salads were basic, nothing special.  

We noticed the restaurant was seriously freezing, like we were all eating in our coats and shivering.  Our waitress said the building controls the climate so it's sort of out of their hands but they were working on it.  By the end of dinner the climate turned into a balmy/greenhouse feel which was strange and also uncomfortable.  

My friends both ordered the Scallops for dinner and I ordered the Chicken Paillard.  Their Scallops also arrived very fishy smelling and one of my friends said she had tried the scallops at lunchtime and they were WAY better before.  My Chicken was boring and tasteless, I could have made it better at home myself. I had to ask for balsamic vinegar to bring some kind of taste to it.  

The only saving grace to this place were the complimentary Petits Fours we received for dessert only because we told the manager the scallops were fishy.  At least the pastry chef might know what he/she is doing.  Also the free baguette and butter was decent so we tried to fill up on that. 

By the time we left around 9:00pm there was NO ONE at the bar.  One of my friends went home and got very sick from her meal.  I'm guessing this restaurant has their ""A Team"" in the kitchen during lunch hours because that's when they do the bulk of their business, but this experience was horrible all around.  The evening was a waste of time and money and I have a strong feeling this place won't be around for much longer.",1.0
"Ok so I'm never eating at this place again. I just got a delivery two custom rolls that I always get (salmon eel and cream cheese) and I decided to try their steamed lobster and spinach dumplings. The rolls this time fell apart the second you picked the up and you could tell the fish was old. The dumplings inside were very tasty but I didn't expect an order of dumplings to turn into three chunks of lobster, the dough for the dumpling was so raw I couldn't believe it. Raw white rubber. I feel like I'm gonna be sick but I'm trying my best to keep it down but it's coming up. Never ordering here again, the price and convenience isn't worth wasting money to get sick, and the fact that I tipped the delivery guy 20% and he was trying to tell me how much to tip him ticked me off beyond belief. What was the reason I didn't call to complain and exchange my food you ask? I already know how rude these people are and know I would've gotten a no once the money was in their hands. The b on their window is bad enough but should really be a d. Gordon Ramsey would walk in here and leave on an ambulance considering all the variety he tries when he goes somewhere. Never again will I give this place one more chance the past year this place turned to shit",1.0
"Average brunch. Inside is very small and with a bar. You line up outside.
We ordered....banana walnut pancakes, corn beef hash, and farmhouse breakfast. Out of all dishes, the pancakes were the best, the other two were okay. I actually think my party that ate the poached eggs got a little bit sick due to the eggs were extremely runny. Our waitress was very nice and refilled out coffee several times. The food came out really slow though. Overall, it truly is good enough to eat, but not great enough to return if there are better options.",1.0
"The food was ""inventive"" and the drinks were pretty good, but that's about all I can say. Many of the waiters were rude and slow. Two of our group ordered the pre-theater fixed price option, but before even our main course arrived we were already late for our show (and we had ordered 2 hrs in advanced). And on top of all that, all FOUR of us ended up getting terribly sick later that night with food poisoning-like symptoms. This was the only type of food we all ate together, so this was about the only lace we could think we got it from. I can maybe see how this place has good ratings if others had better experiences but I have absolutely NO idea how it got a Michelin star.",1.0
"This one-star review is for the FOOD only. Over-priced and mostly microwaved. In a word: disgusting.

The short of it: four of us went there for lunch today, three of us are sick or nauseated in one way or another. 

I got the avocado and egg on an english muffin off their ""brunch all day"" menu. From what I could tell, the entire sandwich had been put together hours earlier, and then the entire thing was microwaved to be heated. 

They microwaved a toasted english muffin. They microwaved a sliced avocado. They microwaved sprouts! It was disgusting. Besides the texture of rubberized food, it just tasted gross. Complete waste of $5.50.

The people who work there are super-friendly, though. And I thought the cold brew was fantastic.",1.0
"NEVER AGAIN EVER.

The decor of the place isn't that great, but I've been to restaurants where the food was so great that the decor didn't even matter.

My sister ordered the california roll and when I tried hers it tasted ""off"", definitely not fresh. I didn't comment on the taste because i wanted her to be able to enjoy her meal even though I now braced for the nastiness of my meal.

I ordered the Udon with tempura. Safe choice right? NOT EVEN. The soup tasted fine, but again the miso soup that came with the meal tasted ""off.""

Lo and behold i get home and as I lay down I get super dizzy and run to the bathroom where I puke out chunks of the miso and udon. My sister didn't barf until the following day.

"Came here on a Tuesday night for the sushi bar omakase. The place was small and cozy. The staff was very attentive. Chef Ichmura works very slowly and quietly. I do wish the courses came out a little quicker but because the chef was the only one preparing the dishes it's understandable that it was a little slow 
The quality of fish was great or so we thought. We actually ended up getting sick the next day. It was too much of a coincidence to not be from the dinner. It could been an off night.",1.0
Took them an hour and 40 minutes to make and deliver 2 salads and a soup four blocks away. Once we got our order it was wrong and the soup got us sick. Never again will I order or walk into this place in the slopes again.,1.0
"I was recently here for a birthday party. The food ranged from very good to ok. The reason for such a low rating is that a bunch of us who ate there got very sick the next day, so it seems very likely that something at the restaurant sickened us. I'm not sure it was the food, though, since otherwise everyone should have been sick (we more or less all ate the same thing), so perhaps one of the servers was sick and/or didn't properly wash his/her hands. I'm not sure exactly what the cause, but I'm pretty confident something at this restaurant was the cause, so I do not think I will be returning there in the future.",1.0
I was there on Mother's Day. What a horrible experience I had we had a table of 14 people we didn't get a waiter until 45 minutes and only 4 waters on the table. He came and got the order from us  and when he came back a 1 hour and half later the food was cold and it was all wrong. The pit bread was hard has a rock the pasta was cold and the rib steak was all fat. Then I notice that the board of health grade was pending. If I would have seen that I would have never went in. Also table was not good for us for 14 people. Do not go to this place at all. That night 6 people of my family were sick from the food it was very bad.,1.0
"The worst food i ever had. 

First of all i went there in person to have it to go. They looked me in a disgusting look. 

Secondly when i placed the order with them they seem like they were in a rush to serve customers when there's no one in the restaurant.  

Third when i got the food the soup base was cold and i asked them why is the soup cold isn't it supposed to be hot? 

Fourth when i brought it back home i found out they messed up with my order i told them no avocados and wassbi bc i was allergic.  I didn't know the sauce was wassbi. 

Fifth me and my god sis end up getting sick.  Diaherra all night and also this morning. 

Service sucks and food wasn't fresh. Stay away",1.0

"This place has given my co-workers food poisoning on multiple occasions. I have actually called the restaurant to let them know and they apologized but haven't done anything to address it, as it's happened multiple times in the past few months.

"This place used to be good but last night we were a table of 6 and wanted hotpot. The soup base came however the food we ordered took forever to come. Our soup base was boiled to where it is half gone. The utensils by the sauce table was so dirty. There were still leftover food stuck on the utensils!! The sauce table was so dirty and messy. 

The soup base used to have flavor however we ordered the bone soup and it was literally clear like water and lacked flavor. A few of us ended up having diarrhea. I will not be coming back!",1.0
"Food here was mediocre at best.

We got the oysters and asked for lime, but they wouldn't give it to us ""because that's what the ssam cocktail sauce is for."" It wasn't great and when we asked for hot sauce, they said they only had sriracha or the house made ssam sauce (which isn't spicy).

We also god the pork buns, but it was really greasy and bland. Tried adding the ssam sauce, but it's kind of overwhelmingly salty. 

Lastly, we got the tempura soft shelled crab which was the most delicious dish at our meal. Would've benefited if there was something spicy like jalapeños in it, though. 

Immediately after our meal, my sister and I got the worst food poisoning of our lives and we're still trying to recover. I knew better than to trust oysters in the city.",1.0
"My family has ordered from this place regularly but after the last THREE times of trying to hope for the best, we will not order from them again. The owner really needs to regroup and check for quality and freshness. You have made us sick! The gauc had spoiled avocados. Your chicken burrito was cold and tasteless. And your tortilla soup, which is the best ever until now, was not spicy and just a bowl of slop.",1.0
"Ooooch I hate leaving terrible reviews and usually I prefer to say nothing, but this was a pretty subpar experience. 

I chose this place for an early Saturday dinner, based on its sidewalk appeal and its 4.7 google review. Our waitress was very sweet, and the service was not bad. However, the prices are a little high for what you get - small portions and okay food. There are so many more wonderful places in the neighborhood...

And, I'm not 100% sure it was because of the food here, but both of us were sick upon returning home. It's always hard to pinpoint the exact cause, but it seems likely. Either way, we won't be back. 

Two stars because the wine was great.",1.0
"This place made my wife and I sick. It happens. But the worst part is that when I told them about it, they said it wasn't their fault because no one else complained, therefore we must not really be sick. I was told we ate the same things as everyone else, which is not true since we ordered a la carte items in addition to the omakase. I was condescended to on the phone, accused of lying and treated like garbage. The sushi chef was great, I don't blame him, but the management of this place is terrible. Will never go back for that reason, and must recommend that you can find sushi as good other places without being treated so poorly. Caveat emptor!",1.0
"Having previously been to the Chelsea location and enjoyed the food, I was pleased to see Ootoya open a Greenwich village outpost. There were many positives from our experience - the ability to get a reservation for 13 on a Saturday night - a spacious and comfortable settings, generally tasty food (chicken meatball and beef yakitori, along with the egg custard side dish were the highlights for me), but a few big negatives really tainted the experience for us, and make it impossible for me to give this restaurant a high rating:
1) A friend arrived with an almost full tea drink from another cafe and the restaurant made a huge fuss about it and basically confiscated it. I get that this is a pretty standard policy at a lot of restaurants, but the way it was handled pretty much ensured the evening got off on the wrong foot
2) For our table of 13 the food more or less came out 1 at a time. As the first person to be served, I was initially reluctant to start eating given the majority of the people didnt have any food in front of them. After waiting a good ten minutes, with only half the table having been served, I reluctantly started to eat for fear of my food getting cold. I'm pretty glad I didnt wait, given that it was probably a full 20+ minutes after my food was served that the final person got their dish.I know I would have trouble serving a party of 13 simultaneously, but then I'm not a professional chef running a restaurant kitchen.
3) At least 6 people at our group felt somewhat sick after eating the first course. Two of them had to get up and leave shortly after their entrees arrived, having left them untouched. Its a little difficult to diagnose exactly what caused this, but the restaurant was completely unapologetic and unsympathetic about it.",1.0
"Horrible Vietnamese food. Do not eat here my gf and I got real sick.
Stomach will rumble and made my tummy hurt for couple hours. Pho broth taste too sweet feel like missing couple ingredients maybe anise. The worst is Com Tam grilled pork broken rice and they don't served with broken rice wtf. The chicken curry is bland and potatoes smell rotten. I would never eat here in my life again I would give it negative 2 stars if I could. They should reevaluate there menu or find a new chef they need help here.",1.0
"Nice looking restaurant. Very nice staff. Food was good in the restaurant but was sick all night and the next morning after. Only had one cocktail that night at the restaurant. Maybe it was something else but only ate a bagel that morning.

Anyway, a lot of the complaints are that the portions are too small for a high price. I thought that the size was appropriate for each dish.

We started with the guacamole. It was simple guac but still tasty. Nothing that you couldn't make at home.

Had asparagus, burrata, bean salad, tamal, and meringue husk desert. The meringue husk was pretty to look at and had an interesting taste. Expect a salty taste though. 

Mostly 3 stars just bc being sick was aggravating and we tried an asparagus dish at the nomad restaurant which tasted better. The drinks were good, we tried paloma and margharita. Worth a try, I'm sure my experience wasn't the norm.",1.0

She was extremely rude )We sat at bar and after 45 minutes we were seated. Waiter order our drinks and decide to come back 20 minutes to take our order.

"Two stars, two words: MSG poisoning. We ordered the beef scallion pancake, soy bean tofu salad, and one each of the pork and crab xiao long bao. The pancake was delicious and crispy. The xiao long bao were average, hot at least, tasted as expected but nothing mind blowing. Salad was fine.

But the real adventure began about 15 minutes after we left.

"I was really excited to try this place and finally had a chance last week.  We went on a Thursday night and were excited there wasn't a wait.  I have to say I was quite disappointed.  

The pros here:
Ambience is great,  I love the open kitchen 
Drinks are awesome - try the penicillin 
Servers are knowledgable and friendly
Diver scallops - I'm not a fan of the texture of scallops but omg the dashi I would have licked the bowl if I could.

The underwhelming:
Fluke - the sauce it was in was meh. The flavors didn't seem to compliment each other
Oysters - wasn't a fan of the plum sauce.  
Chawanmushi - hated the smoky flavor of the mushrooms
Beet salad - I was expecting this to be a little sweeter since it was on a honey sauce...but lots of earthy sweet flavors and it felt like something was missing
Steak - was ok nothing amazing.  It was on top of a ramp purÃ©e...but the ramps were purÃ©ed to the point that I couldn't taste the natural flavors
For dessert we got the lychee and I think honeydew sorbet but again nothing memorable.

Cons:
The upset stomach both myself and my friend had for the next few days.

Granted I don't eat pork, but we tried a variety of dishes and I was not impressed. Furthermore the upset stomach I had for the next few days has turned me off to this place.  My friend had been here a few times before and was also surprised by the quality of food.  

If it wasn't for our awesome server I'd give this place a 1 star for literally making me sick for the next few days.",1.0

"I hate writing negative reviews about places that I think ""do"" and ""should"" have all the elements to be an extraordinary dining experience but tonight's disappointing meal & it's aftermath prompted this review.  I spent a lot of time/energy looking for a restaurant for my bf's bday - trying to find a place that would match the service, food, atmosphere & trendiness factors that the new restaurants he takes me always seem to excel at.  In essence, I wanted something special & the glowing reviews on Yelp, NY Mag, etc. made me cancel a much coveted reservation at a very buzz-worthy/hot Japanese place, in lieu of Rebelle where I thought we'd have a more memorable evening.  Boy was that decision f*ed. 

The evening started ordinarily enough but was punctuated by inconsistency & odd vibe.  Though our table was visited several times by random busers & our waiter they were all incredibly stoic - imagine people just coming to your table & not saying a word (ie when the menus were just set down w/o an introduction or a smile).  Did I somehow walk into a practice run of Sleep No More? It was just... weird or maybe our waiter was sparing us b/c his breath STANK something awful so perhaps I should be grateful.  Regardless, I was excited for our meal - which I figured would be great considering their extremely limited menu.  We placed orders, and waited.... and waited....   and waited..... 

The momentum of the evening seemed to have peaked with the journey from the hostess to our table.  The energy was off, water glasses un-refilled, timing between plates extremely long and dragged out.  Basically at 1.25 hrs in we were still w/o entrees, water or fresh cocktails -  anyone would start to get a little grouchy, no? I complained & asked where our food was privately to the waiter b/c frankly I was pissed that THIS - mediocre food, barely there service - was how his bday evening was going but didn't want my bf to be aware and ruin his evening further. Of course, he failed to communicate this to the manager who came over to offer dessert which we declined - but again, no discretion.  Rather then let the manager know how I really felt, just politely smiled b/c I felt bad that my bf knew I was also upset.   I just left there feeling so incredibly DISAPPOINTED and sad... I hoped to redeem the evening with cake & presents at home. 

Anyhow, the reason I'm writing this review at 1:58 am is b/c the evening only got worse & the sentiment was exacerbated by the fact that w/in a half hour, I was feeling ill and burping (tmi?) with nausea - it faded but my bf started feeling sick shortly after.   We didn't even make it to cake or presents.

It's his BIRTHDAY & he is sitting on a bathroom floor MISERABLE & SICK and has to be up tomorrow at 5 for work. If they were open, I'd be calling them right now to let them know. Instead I write this & wait to see if it passes or worsens enough to go to the ER.  For the person who wrote ""run don't walk"" to this restaurant - I truly despise you.  Wtf.  

To be honest, while the food was okay, it wasn't anything worthy of the acclaim its received.  It was hard to tell if it was even good b/c by the time it came out I was so hungry I just had to eat!  
Cocktails: nothing innovative
Good dishes: fluke (share this not b/c it's a large plate but b/c one can only swallow so many bites of this warm, buttery fish w/o feeling a little gaggy from the texture).  The Monkfish (tasty had it not been cold and somewhat salty)
Okay:  Pate (portion is way too big, I felt like there was a murder scene on our plate but only came w/ 2 small pieces of bread), duck 
Sucked: leeks aka mostly onion but bland, squash (the likely culprit in us both being ill) also bland
Wines: didn't try them but I liked their stemware",1.0

I finally inquire about the ownership of this place p, waitress is like 'I m new here', then I told her that hakka noodles are spoiled and saag paneer has too much salt, she took the tray back to kitchen almost with an attitude, she sort discarded any concern or offered any remedy to the situation!

Then comes the bill which we had to wait for 15 mins, btw my sis n i were the only two ppl dinning there!!!! Then waitresses and a very new waitress stood over our head, now they were in a hurry to get paid!!!! 


Disgusting! How the hell they got an A, Barley anything was warm there! 

I am sure this place going to be closed soon! Or change ownership...

One more thing, we got a dirty look from the Chef who finally brought so called fresh hakka noodles after we paid!

"Really wanted to like this place, but I'm giving it 3 stars and I personally don't have any plans to return. The wait staff and service were world-class, but the seasonal tasting menu was practically inedible. Things were undercooked, over-seasoned and flavors clashed like they were angry at each other. I'm not a culinary expert, but try to imagine how the following dishes tasted: 1) Ruby Red Shrimp & Green Mint sauce, 2) Overcooked Halibut drenched in a tomato sauce w/ olives, 3) Spicy Red Pepper Sauce + Chorizo + Lobster, 4) Rare slices of ribeye + blue cheese lumps.

Anyway, our waiter was a sweetheart. The bartender wasn't mean but she definitely had something against smiling. She wasn't friendly at all and didn't make us feel welcome. My friend was coughing up a storm because I guess she choked and I asked for water and the bartender said ok and she kept texting and then started mixing drinks. HELLOOOOO LADY! DO YOU NOT SEE SOMEONE COUGHING?! It literally takes less then a min to her a glass of water...especially to someone who is coughing and clearly needs it. When she finally gets the water, she doesn't even bother to look at us when she puts it down and the straw fell behind the bar and I had to try to reach over and get it myself. So ridiculous.

"Me and some family were in Brooklyn for the weekend and decided to try this out after seeing the good reviews. We were seated right away and everything seemed ok ,until we asked our waiter to tell us more about their lamb burger and the guy was so rude. He said with the accent ""A wah u wan know, It's just a regular burger with everything you see there, nothing special"". We were shocked; he acted as if we were bothering him, ZERO people skills.  This guy had ZERO customer service all he did was bring the food. Another waiter noticed our disbelief and started helping our table. We passed on the burger!! I got the salmon which looked delish. The taste was o.k.. Problem is, the next day I was sick with vomit and diarrhea all day. I got a case of food poising! Then I spoke with my brother who also tried some of the salmon and he was sick as well. 
The business was closed Monday when I called to complain. I got the management on Tuesday and she too had little customer service skills--this explained the waiter.

"Disgrasian- a person who brings shame or loss of respect, honor, or reputation to their race

I rarely if ever write one star reviews but this one is truly worthy if the situation ever presented itself.  3-4 months ago I booked a reservation for a party of 70 of my closest family and friends for a dinner and a deposit was made and penciled into the calendar.  This place had been used in the past by former family and friends for similar gatherings so I felt despite the mixed yelp reviews, this place was a known quantity.  Imagine my surprise when 1 month prior to the reservation, I get a phone call from the manager not asking but TELLING me that we were bumped to their basement floor since they had a larger party that wanted to reserve the main floor and his comment was ""You understand how it is right? (subtext: you're chinese, you know how we are...)  Ummm....NO, there is nothing Chinese or Asian about not honoring an agreement with a deposit for the sake of making more money.  He pretty much said take it or leave it since there was no room for negotiations or a discount.  Due to lack of time in rescheduling a new venue since we were planning this dinner from out of town, I had my sister (who is a local) evaluate the basement floor and it actually looked presentable and had added privacy, although I was still steaming based on principle.

Fast forward to the day of the dinner a few weeks ago, the manager finally showed a shred of remorse and offered to throw in an extra dish....but it never came.  We gave them a headcount of around 70 so with tables fitting 10 people, we were expecting to pay for 7 tables.  Upon arrival, there was an assortment of medium and large tables so that some tables fit 10 whereas others fit 7-8.  They then proceeded to charge us for 8 tables and blamed us for seating ourselves even though we clearly were feeding the equivalent of 7.  How many Asian 3rd graders do you need to make this calculation?  No real complaints actually about the food (cue in ominous foreshadowing music...) and we then reach the classic end of a chinese banquet with a sweet dessert soup.  Imagine the shock and horror when the soup is presented before us served not in bowls, but in CHEAP PLASTIC CUPS?!  I'm pretty sure in the history of Chinese banquets, this has never been done and the emperor would have surely rolled heads back in the day.  If you ran out of silverware or bowls, you are much better omitting the last course than to trudge out this embarrassing spectacle.

However, I've saved the coup de grace for last.  Fast forward 30hrs post dinner, and imagine the outrage when I'm informed 23 of the guests who attended this dinner were either vomiting or having diarrhea all night (including my mother who wasn't sure she was well enough to catch the plane back home).  You don't need a statistics guru to figure out the source so the NY department of Health got involved and recently isolated a virus from stool samples (how's that for a thank you for coming to dinner?).  Not sure if it was from the food or contaminated employees who didn't wash their hands, but there are no words to describe the disaster this experience was for nearly all involved.  If there was a floor for one star yelp reviews, I think I may have found it and subsequently discovered the Marianas Trench happens to lie below it and that's where you will find this establishment.",1.0
"As a Muslim, I really hate to give 2 stars to a halal establishment but my last visit was really disheartening. Despite impeccable service, I really feel like sub par food is grounds for a low rating, especially if the food makes you sick.

First of all, we came for Father's Day. My brother suggested this place and I wish I checked the reviews before we came. Had I done that, I would have suggested elsewhere. We were seated next to a family with a bunch of screaming children. In all fairness, we were asked if we would like to move to a table farther away. We declined seeing that our table was more spacious and the suggested one was a bit cramped. We ordered the drumstick heaven or whatever you call it and those were ok. I didn't see the huge deal people made over them but, not bad. Drinks, I ordered a green tea and that was good. They brought out honey to go with it and I appreciated that alot being that not many restaurants do that. 

Now onto the food. I don't know what they do to the green curry but I ordered the lamb, mom ordered the fish, and dad ordered the duck, all in green curry. We all got sick, me the worst. When I say sick I mean I had to use the bathroom. The bathrooms are filthy by the way. No one else got sick to my knowledge. We skipped dessert, took our food to go, paid the bill and got the hell out of there. 

I thought maybe if I cooked the food down some more at home, it would be better. I got sick again so I know for a fact it was the food at Taipan. 

My advice: FIRE YOUR COOK!! Would love to see your restaurant on a Kitchen Nightmares episode. Aside from the culinary displeasure, our male servers were polite and accommodating. The waitress was a bit crude. I also noticed her cleaning other tables and she wasn't doing a good job at all. Decor was nice though.

"Bad News
On Sunday, August 24, 2014, my nephew and I had dinner at Buckley's.  We each had French Onion Soup and Prime Rib.  My nephew usually inhales the soup.  I finish most of it and leave the rest as a token to the gods.  He did not finish his.  I had about one quarter of mine.  It tasted really salty.  I mean really, really salty.  The beef was as good as always.  That night I woke up with a pain like I was having a heart attack.  It was ridiculous.  I tried pills, liquid and Nexxium.  Nothing helped.  At one point I was about to call 911.  Later I had to go to the bathroom to relieve my body of this curse.  I went a bunch of times and blew the toilet out each time.  At one point I passed out and fell on the floor.  I was able to crawl to my bed and go to sleep.  Now I'm nursing a cut/bruised knee.  The stomach pain is gone.  I called my nephew later that day.  Lo and Behold, he had the same problems.  I think the soup was BAD.  I don't think I'm going back to Buckley's.  I don't like getting poisoned and I'm not the kid of person who sues people.",1.0
"Went back today after a 2 year hiatus.  We used to love this place.  In the past, the decor was terrible, but we were drawn by the food, the service, and the prices...  Now that the place was renovated, the only appeal is the decor...  the food/service/prices have all changed (and not for the better).  The beans were tasteless, the maduros kind of dry, the yuca was hard, the bacalao didn't look, smell or taste like any Dominican bacalao I've had in the past- and that's not a compliment.  The worst part?  My wife and son became really sick, vomiting and diarrhea.  I was bloated and felt nauseous.  The only thing I can attribute this to is that the 3 of us had Guanabana shakes (the shake sucked as well- super thick, cake like, and an eye squinting amount of sugar).  Lastly, the waitress had her tip automatically added to our 40 dollar bill.  I've seen this done with much higher restaurant bills, but not for  a 40 buck dinner.  Not sure if it's a new owner, but he/she has their work cut out for them.  This isn't the same La Brisa restaurant we once knew.  Customer lost.",1.0
"Summary: AVOID like the plague

Plus:
The beef with tendon broth is very delicious and flavorful.
The pork filling in the dumplings is delicious

Negatives:
Place is dirty
Service is crazy slow at 2PM Sunday. 45 mins to get our food.
MSG is main ingredient in the soup
The noodle is too doughy.
The dumplings are too doughy.
Dumplings that were suppose to be fried, it's steamed soggy.

My wife and I had food poisoning here. First time and last time coming here.

Prosperity dumplings in Manhattan are less doughy, cheaper, and they serve you within 30 seconds fresh from the pan frier. 

Lanzhou Handmade Noodle in Flushing is not doughy/starchy, very light and flavorful.",1.0

"Do not eat here. 

Last night, I ordered the chimichanga and it tasted like a giant, dirty egg roll. When I went home, I was soon sick.

I went to the doctor today because my stomach was killing me....and I didn't have food poisoning...

I have worms. The doctor asked me what I had eaten in the last 24 hours and I said ""Pedro's"". I was prescribed an anthelmintic for my worms.

"What's better than violently vomiting, sweating and shivering all night? Violently vomiting, sweating and shivering all night when you're 5 months pregnant. I felt compelled to write this as s warning bc of how sick i became.

Came here for the first time last night based on the stellar reviews, and not only was I disappointed by the taste of the food, but unbeknownst to me, I also left with a horrible case of food poisoning. Being a vegetarian, i didn't order any meat or fish dishes, so i suspect the staph aureus bacteria that made me ill either came from my *vile* roasted vegetable market entree, or the flavorless peanut butter sundae I had for dessert (the pb mouse and whipped cream seemed too warm). Being pregnant, not only does food poisoning hit you harder, but it can also do harm to the baby. I hope to g-d everything is okay.

The roasted vegetable entree was vile for many reasons. One being the vegetables were way overcooked. Another being the fact that I couldnt even identify what vegetables they were-- one item on the plate was grayish and looked like something you'd find on the bottom of the ocean. The peanut butter sundae was bland and the ""cookie"" in the middle was a very strange consistency. Though the decor is nice, i left feeling very underwhelmed-- but when i started feeling ""off"" about an hour later, i knew this place was not only poor, but dangerous too.",1.0
"If you are in the mood to get sick after you eat here please feel free to go.  Came into this place with my wife and sister in law and her husband.  When I walk into a place in a Friday night and I see that it is dead, Houston we have a problem.  The garlic bread that they first served us were drenched I mean drenched in oil.  Then we ordered clams and it felt like I was eating sand.  Tried to stay positive so I ordered the platter for two for 100 dollars it came with fish and shrimp scallops and most importantly 2 lobster tails.  Good came and we began to eat my sister in law got the ribs and lobster tail meal.  The ribs actually tasted good they fell right off the bone.  As for our dish im not a fan of fish and I asked if they could substitute something else for the fish said no was like ok.   The scallops actually tasted very good best thing on the platter the shrimp was bad had a horrible taste to it. I didn't touch the flounder I went for the he lobster tails oh my God what a disappointment the tail was tough and chewy I was so angry.  Finally the water says was everything good today I said no the lobster was the worse l have ever had.  He says he's going to tell the manager.  Manager never came but the waiter comes back and tells me that the lobster is hardshell lobster that's why the meat was tough.  I didn't know they had lobster that gives you tough mean and one that was tender.  The best part about this seafood restaurant was their fries.

The food tasted okay, but we did get sick later that evening. That's what we get for food reheated in the microwave for a few seconds. I'd rather eat at Raja Sweets which doesn't appear to be as clean, but at least none of us got sick and the food was HOT!

This Store is exactly .09 miles and 5 minutes away from my House 

By 12:50 AM, I still did not receive the delivery, so I called the store. 

First,  When The Guy who answered the phone hear me calling to follow up on my delivery, he hunh up on me. Like this, I had to call back another 3 times, with different numbers; He finally stop hanging up on me, but this time, him and His Co-Worker are Laughing Sarcastically at me on the phone after His Co-worker said:""Let the B**** Wait"". then Hung up on me again with No Answer for my order.

After that, They purposely Delayed another 15 Minutes on my delivery. 

So finally at 1:40AM, and After 1 Hour and 40 Minutes Hassle and Harrassment, I  received the delivery.

This is not the Ollie's that used to be near Times Square. I am not sure how they are using the same name. The environment itself is pleasant and well decorated with friendly staff but the food is far from being pleasant. The scallion pancakes were dripping in oil which is amazing as even over local Chinese restaurant does a better job with them. The dumplings were good but the cumin lamb was almost inedible as it had about 10 times as much cumin as it needed.  We are used to eating all kind of spicy food from all kind of nationalities and we cook all kind of spicy food ourselves plus my background is Indian. Trust me this was bad. The beef and noodle soup was tasteless. So i put one tiny piece of the cumin lamb in the soup and it flavored the entire dish with cumin. At least then I could it eat it. Six hours later we were both really sick. I can't say for sure it came from this meal but even with out that we will never go back to this place.,1.0

My friends home fries were ice cold. I asked for a refill of coffee in a clean cup and they brought it to me in a plastic soda cup. WTF. They put a bowl of butter samplers on the table and there was a mysterious blob on one. Couldn't touch them, too grossed out. There was a half eaten muffin on the floor. If this even interests you by now, the food was awful. We felt sick by the time we left.

The first time I came here, Alicia Keys was finishing up in the booth we were later sat in so I definitely had high hopes - how things have changed.  The last two times we came here we sat at the bar and both the food and service were mediocre.  Single items being bought out to our group with significant wait times in between.  The bartender disappeared quite frequently - just a mess but I chalked it up and still returned recently for their 1/2 off lobster special and all 3 of us were up sick all night.  

We also had the mini lobster rolls (STELLAR), Caesar salad (GOOD) and calamari(AVERAGE AT BEST - thank goodness it was such a tiny portion/less than 10 pieces) as starters but the lobsters were a bit chewy.  Also ordered the lobster mash potatoes on a whim and it was gross.  Hard, bland and with one chunk of lobster placed on top of the dish.  

The upstairs ladies room reeked and lacked ventilation.  Should have steered clear a long time ago.

Not worth it.  Take care City Crab.",1.0
"I was expecting a lot from this place as I had a great experience at Yakitori Totto.  

We were seated in the back next to the bathroom and near a large party.  Why they even have a table there, I don't even know (you constantly having people walking past you to relieve themselves).  I can let that go.  What I can't let go is, the horrible service.  It was impossible to get any server's attention and when we finally are able to, we get served after other groups that asked for assistance way after we did.  This is simple things, like a water refill.  The food quality was horrid too for the price.  We ordered various yakitori, mussels, a carpacchio, and several tempura items (veggies, calamari, baby octopus).  The tempura was actually very soggy!  The meat was inconsistent and had a very strange taste, I suspect it was undercooked.

We both ended up sick that evening.  

The worse part of the night was since we were so appalled by the food and service we decided to give the bare minimum tip.  The waitress actually chased us outside and asked why we didn't tip more!  We explained to her the situation and she kept arguing ""But I served you guys right?""  

I rarely say this and I'm generally forgiving and open minded but AVOID THIS PLACE unless you have a party of 5 or more.  Personally, i'd still avoid this place and head straight to the much better sister restaurant Yakitori Totto.",1.0
"I came here for an early Thursday dinner with my boyfriend. We went off the yelp reviews and such to find a nice place with food and oysters. 
As we walk in the beachy decore caught our eye,  somewhat of The Hampton's feel to it. 
We got our oysters on the happy menu which was great $8 for half a dozen. 
The oysters were great the decor was lovely the staff was a little absent minded but we're patient people so we didn't mind seeing how good the oysters were. BINGO! 

YA RIGHT!! We proceed to order dinner the seafood special which had an assortment of crab legs, lobster tail, scallops and stuffed shrimp. And an order of steamed muscles with white wine sauce. The seafood special couldn't even fill a 12yr old boy let alone the fishy smell it came with, the crab legs probably frozen. The steamed muscles were soaking in butter, I felt I was eating butter sticks.. high cholesterol... no thanks! We didn't finish our meal we cleared our bill and headed home. 

We both got terribly sick. 

Word to the wise... stop at the oysters. If you want proper Greek Seafood go on to 36th and Ditmars... don't waste your time or upset your body.",1.0
"Created a Yelp account just to write this review!

Ordered the Pork Katsu and it tasted and looked like it came out of a freezer bag. It was like something out of a TV dinner or elementary school lunch. The dipping sauce tasted A1 and ketchup, so that didn't help.

We very nicely asked if we could return it and order something else, because we honestly couldn't eat it. The response was simply no, you can't change what you order, and our server walked away. 

Paid our bill quickly and left. We had only had a few bites and it was so greasy and the meat was so bad we were sick with gas ALL night! 

If a customer is not happy with something and is willing to try something else they should get to, especially if they are nice about it and the restaurant isn't busy. My boyfriend and I both work in restaurants and we would have never treated our table the way we were treated. 

If anything, just DON""T order the Pork Katsu!",1.0
"Be warned all.....

We have been to this restaurant for dim sums and dinners on numerous occasions, the service was always good and the food was always delicious. It was a trusted restaurant until we encountered an unfortunate event here.  We hosted a baby banquet dinner at this restaurant on December 27, 2014 with 50-60 guests.  The service was very good, the wait staffs were attentive and engaging.  The food was delicious and appeared fresh.  Overall, we had a great night. However, 24 hours later, most if not all of my guests became ill from the food they ate from this restaurant with severe vomiting and diarrhea.  At first, we did not suspect it was from this restaurant, but when 90% of my guests became ill at the same time it became highly suspicious.  When confronted to the owner,  he did not want to take any responsibility.  A case is now open with the Department of Health to investigate.

Unfortunately, when we made our second box, we had bad ingredients.  First we made the cod and I got sick that night.  I'm pregnant so I gave blue apron the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to pregnancy related sickness.  The next day we went to make our chicken dish.  The smell of the raw chicken was revolting.  It had gone bad quite a while ago.  I was home when the box came and all ingredients were cold, so I think it left the warehouse spoiled.  I tried to contact Blue Apron twice and received no response.  It's now been a week.  I see them say, ""contact us and we will make it right"" on bad reviews, but apparently that is just for show.  Extremely disappointed.  $60 is too much money for spoiled food, not to mention the extreme inconvenience of having to come up with a plan B for dinner at the last minute.",1.0

"I would not come back here. Period.

It is very clean inside and service is friendly. The lunch menu is nice and the prices are great for the financial district. I spent a total of $11 for a soup and 2 beef sliders which is great.... The food not so great.

For one thing if you are coming here for your lunch break beware because the service takes awhile. I spent almost my whole lunch hour waiting for food. Being that this is primarily a business area and not a residential area most eateries around here are very speedy knowing that people typically only step out for 1 hour. So that was the first con. The second con was that my broccoli soup was cold. Not even warm I couldn't believe it. The sad part was that the soup was pretty tasty but I couldn't get the full effect. How on earth could I have waited so long and not have hot soup?! The sliders were sub par nothing that great. My friend had a Ceasar salad and we both agreed that something in it was super salty.

"I had a very bittersweet experience.

SWEET Experience  ---The appetizers are delicious, they are a variety of cold appetizers of vegetables and meat.  Definitely worth trying because the flavors are unique, strong, but not over powering.  

This place is well known for their Xiao Long Bao ( soup dumplings) and there noodles, and I can see why.  The flavoring is just right, the skin doesn't pop very easily when you try to pick it up. But the skin isn't thick either, still relatively thin and the meat is moist and flavorful.  The soup is actually slightly less fattening compared to many other Main St restaurants.  

I ordered the Kung Fu Beef Noodle Soup, and the flavor is great.  Definitely a fattening dish, but it is delicious. the Beef is flavorful and well marinated, the soup is great, although I preferred it to be lighter and less salty.  I am not sure what kind of noodle they use, but it is just right.  One of the most amazing noodles I had ever had.  Not too thick, or too thin.  Not to soft or too chewy.  It has a nice texture and it soaks up the flavor in the soup very well.

BITTER EXPERIENCE----- I also ordered a bowl of soy milk because I love  sweet soy milk with fried dough.  This is a very popular combination.  I felt fine with all I ate so far, and lastly I drank my soy milk.  In the end I started to feel nauseous, dizzy, and my stomach was upset.  About 20 minutes later, I had a terrible urge to throw up.  My mother and I both threw up.  She only had the soy milk, therefore we concluded the soy milk wasn't prepared properly.  Possible just for today!

Soy milk is made from soy bean which gets blended with water, then boiled.  Without properly processing the excess waste and boiling the liquid extract from the blending, the soy milk can make people sick.  Therefore, anyone who plans to make soy milk, make sure you boil it long enough.  This place certainly didn't, my mother and I had to suffer for the consequence. 

I recommended everything else, but the soy milk.  or maybe nothing from this place, I don't know what exactly made me throw up, but that is one possible conclusion.",1.0
"My friends and I love beer so we decided to try it.  Beer Authority has an extensive tap list but it wasn't very varied.  They were out of a bunch of the beers we wanted to order.  The beer list and the menus were extremely dirty, as was the table.  Our food took 50 minutes to get to us and it wasn't even good.  Plus, we didn't have silverware on our table when the food came out.  The chicken fingers were pink, the fries tasted old, the salmon was undercooked, and the sliders were so tiny, even for sliders.  Half of us felt sick afterwards.  The server messed up the order too.  My friend asked for no cheese on her burger and it came with cheese anyway.  She is lactose intolerant so she sent it back and it took another 20 minutes for a new one to come out.  We waited for ketchup for 20 minutes also.  it was absurd.  Then, they charged us for the cheese!  The service was not only slow, but our server was VERY rude and arrogant. She acted like it was a burden for her to serve us.  She was an Irish lady who never smiled and hardly checked on us.  We would have ordered more rounds of beer if she had come over more.  Then, she had the nerve to add gratuity to our bill!  This woman certainly did not deserve a good tip.  TIPS stands for ""to insure proper service"" and our service was far from proper.  Our waters also took a long time.  The restaurant was also too loud.  Everything about this place was a disappointment.  We asked to speak to a manager but they said they were ""too busy.""

"This place should be avoided under all circumstances. Not only is the food likely going to make you sick, but the waitress may try to rip you off with the check. My wife had to throw up while she was still on premises. My stomach got upset too but somehow miraculously I managed to hold it until we got home. One of our friends found a long curly hair in the meat in his ""schawarma"" sandwich. I write ""schawarma"" in quotations because the meat does not even come close to the special pit preparation you'd expect for this dish. We had 2 ""schawarmas"" but the waitress somehow managed to include a third one in the check. When we asked her to correct the bill, she brought the updated receipt back and immediately picked up the cash we'd prepared, barely leaving us the opportunity to even see what the new total amount was. We had to then directly ask for our change back because clearly she assumed that $20 was a justified tip on a $65 total.  She acted all too surprised when we asked to see our change back so we can decide how much tip to leave.  All things considered, I'd strongly recommend avoiding this place. Downtown Manhattan has enough other fine dining places to choose from, and I'm sure you should never find yourself in such a dire need as to risk experiencing what we just did at Alfanoose!",1.0

"I think the kitchen should get inspected. Several of my colleagues had diarrhea problems after eating there... When it just opened, it was much better. Now the quality has really slid, by a lot!",1.0
"Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.

We were so excited to try this place and everything looked so delicious.  We got a cream-filled pastry and a cookie.  Both tasted a little off, so we both tried them but didn't each much.  We were really disappointed. 

The next day, both of us were incredibly sick and the only thing we had both eaten the previous day were the pastries.  Will never go back.",1.0
"Bought a large piece of sea bass that was cut off the whole fish in front of me. Everyone that had the fish was violently sick. I called the next day to inform them so they would sell the rest of it. The owner on the phone was short, insinuated that I didn't cook the fish properly, offered no apology and did not offer to refund my money.",1.0
I love Spanish food.  I was not happy when I brought home the pernil (roasted pork) from this restaurant and everyone in the house got sick that night. I ended up having to kill a parasite in my intestine for 3 months. from that nights pork. Many employees working their touching food and sneezing..not very clean. Can;t keep pork under a heat lamp all day. Eat at your own risk.,1.0
"Bear burger in Long Island city/ Astoria; My son has had acute stomach pains after eating sliders & an Italian salad yesterday at this bare burger. My other son had the same food but luckily vomited it up. 
I question their quality controls. Sometimes food establishments don't throw out old food when they should or have poor quality controls",1.0
"Great style and atmosphere, helpful bartender, but very poor quality food. The decor, music, ambience and vibe are all pretty good here. My girlfriend and I had great time hanging out with a fantastic wine recommended by server. The wait was a little longer than expected, but nothing outrageous, and we were enjoying just hanging out. If our experience ended before our entrees arrived I'd say we had an excellent experience. My steak was a very poor cut, and the marinade was more of a 'subway southwest sauce' than the ""au poivre"" described. Cooked to perfection, but too awful to eat. My girlfriend enjoyed her Monkfish, although we both ended up sick at the end of our evening, and this was the only meal we shared all day. 2 3/4 stars if I could, but the let-down rounds it down.",1.0
"If you don't want to read my whole experience below, here's a summary: You get what you pay for. $60 omakase is cheap but I rather pay double and go to Yasuda in NYC!

Food Taste: 3 stars We were impressed with the sweet shrimp and lobster with butter garlic herb. 
Food fresnhness: 0 star The fish in the fridge looked old. Please see the pic I posted. We both had diarrhea after dinner.
Service: -1 The lady at the front desk keeps lying! The servers don't clear out our dishes or refill tea. Chef Yasu was offended when we asked what's the difference between the $40 and $60 omakase. He said we only have the $60 omakase and haven't had the $40 omakase in years. I saw it on yelp!!! After he said it, I see the price menu right behind him for the different omakase sets!!!!!!!This place is not honest, so I wouldn't come back for their business!

This is the full story:

I don't understand how this place gets so many 5 stars review. Is it just because the omakase is cheaper compare to others? Service was horrible for a Japanese restaurant. My fiancé and I were in the area since yelp said they do take reservations, we decided to call ahead of time. We called at 6:45pm on Saturday asking for a table at 7:30pm for 2. The lady who answered said they're extremely busy right now and that I would have to wait even with a reservation. She asked me to just come and wait since she won't take my name over the phone. Since we were not super hungry, we decided to go and give it a try.

When I got there, I told the lady at the front desk that I called earlier and was told there will be a wait. She looked at me by surprised and said, ""Oh, it's you. The situation has changed."" What do you mean???The restaurant was empty!!! How did the situation ""change"" in 15 mins!?!? I don't know why she had to lie to me. They have about 15 open tables with about 8 open bar seats. It was pretty much empty at 7pm on a Saturday night. I was upset that she lied to me there was a wait. I left my fiancé looking for parking himself while I rushed to the restaurant. I didn't get to walk around the shops in the neighborhood afraid there would be a wait. The lady kept asking me if I wanted the $60 omakase. She told me I can only sit at the bar if I order omakase. If not, I'll be sitting at a table. I asked her to explain how many pieces or what type of fish they serve. She said she doesn't know. She said it's always different based on the price of the fish they get that day. That doesn't make any sense to me. Every where I went, I know they can't tell you the exact fish since it's by chef choice, they should be able to tell you generally what they have to offer. I told her, I'm not sure yet and want to wait till my fiancé gets here before deciding whether we are ordering omakase or not.

While I was waiting there, I was scrolling the pictures and reviews on yelp. Seems like all the omakase looked similar. How come she wasn't able to tell me that it comes with a lobster soup, sweet shrimp, tuna and monkfish as a starter then other sashimi or nigri to follow! That seems to be very consistent on yelp! My fiancé finally got there and didn't have a preference on what to get. Based on the yelp reviews, seems like the omakase is the way to go. 

When we sat down, she told the chef ""omakase"". We asked the chef what's the difference between the $40 and $60 omakase and showed him the yelp pictures I saw. He seemed offended and said, ""We don't serve $40 omakase. Only $60."" I wasn't even trying to be cheap. I just wanted to know since we wanted to order the Marilyn monroll and other items on the menu. Right after he said that, I saw the omakase price list and how many pieces it comes with! (I posted a pic, so don't get tricked like we did.) I got even more upset when we found out the person and the couple next to us didn't order omakase!!! The lady at the counter told me twice that I need to order omakase in order to sit at the bar!!! I really didn't care where I sit but why did she had to lie to me over and over again!!!

The fridge in front of us was not appetizing! I'm not a sushi chef but I know salmon and tuna shouldn't be piled up on top of each other. They're different parts of salmon and tuna! Not just 1 kind! I posted a pic of it too. I've never ever in my life seen a sashimi fridge like that!!!! My fiancé and I were scared. I wanted to leave at one point. 

The chef told us they weren't able to get any uni from California and the ones directly from Japan were too expensive. We were a bit disappointed but you really can't beat $60 for 16 pieces with a lobster soup anywhere in the city. We felt it was still ok without the uni. Even though the presentation was not as neat compared to the restaurants in NYC, I had to say I was pretty impressed with the sweet shrimp and lobster with butter garlic herb. 

The food tasted fine but we both had diarrhea after eating there. I don't like to support dishonest business owners. We both agreed we're not going back.",1.0
"Food was definitely a miss on a Friday night.

Beef Bulgogi Tacos: it was just an ordinary taco you can get anywhere. I don't see this as an item that has beaten Bobbly Flay's throwdown.

Spicy Tuna Pizza: The tuna was definitely not fresh at all. 

Very Berry Roll: Again, fish was not fresh at all. could barely taste anything. the mix of the berry sauce plus almonds on it made it even more weird.

Spicy Salmon Crostini: this was mostly bland.

Togadashi Fries: worst fries ever.

on top of the horrible meal, my friend and i got sick from it.",1.0
"Very bad food quality which three of us spending total $125.00 for the dinner on last Sat night (2/7/2015, $110. + 16% tip), but two of us got stomach virus, which one went to emergency room , and one had vomiting & diarea which have to stay on the Bed for two days just by drinking Water with nothing else.

So upset with this restaurant, which probably they selling left- over food to new customers to caust us sick because those spicy foods taste really weird.

Suggestion to bring your medical insurance card with you if you dare to eat-in there.",1.0
"The pizza looks good but you'll regret it. I felt SUPER sick after eating this pizza   so did my wife. We tried 4 different types. All looked OK and tasted OK but give it an hour.  Pics look good but not good.  

Oh yeah for the owner your staff is ringing up NO SALES. This means they lie to people and say the credit card machine dosent work and they collect cash in their pocket. They refuse to give receipts.  

The cc machine was sitting there functioning and they refused to use it.  They will pretend to ring up the sale and cancel it before completing Sale.",1.0
I've had the water in Central American and have gotten really sick but that didn't come close to how sick my partner and I got after eating food we ordered from here yesterday. Sadly it's a place we've ordered from several times and the food and service has declined in quality within the last year. Won't be having food from this place again.,1.0
"This is a very nice restaurant. Decent decor, service and food was absolutely amazing. The servers were very attentive. Only downfall is I became very sick hours after eating the food. Not sure if it was just the combination of food that didn't agree with me, as no one else besides my step-daughter and i were sick. All of the food taste very fresh, I'm just not sure what happened. All I know it wasn't a pleasant after experience....

All in all, i would try again....
Just not now!",1.0
"I eat here all the time. Except, this New Year's we had Bon chon and my boyfriend, dad, and I all caught a cold two days after New Years. I can't think of any other culprit because we all woke up sick on the very same day in the very same way. New Years was the only time the three of us together met with nobody else. Can someone tell me if they caught a cold after eating here recently too? I love it here and I love how the chicken is air-fried and sweet. However, if it happens to be this BonChon that got us sick, I don't know. I don't want to make any accusations!",1.0
"I really wanted to like this place and I have been eyeing it for many months since I live so close.  I have always put it off because of price but decided last night to give it a shot.  We ordered a small selection of a few things.  The pretzel dumplings, the wings and the the bacon pad thai.  After not eating meat for the past few days, I was craving it.  

Everything was very tasty but I felt like I was spending a ton of money on something very similar to chinese take-out.  My taste buds were excited and we ate everything, actually every last possible bite.  This raised some suspicions for me.  

The bill was paid and on the walk home both of us felt uneasy.  Definitely felt sick from the food and so did my partner.  My conclusions dont need to be publicly disclosed.  I dont think I will be returning here other than to go to the bar and get a quick drink.  

After all the hype, I have to say I am dissapointed.",1.0
I had the Connecticut Lobster Roll and it was absolutely delicious. Service was ok. They took a little longer than they should have to bring water and glasses. Especially when the restaurant was at 20% capacity.  The only reason I gave it one star is because my entire party which consisted of 3 people total had upset stomachs and diarrhea an hour after eating.,1.0
"rice overcooked, service sucks, fish is old, on top of that there was something in my roll some plastic crap . the rolls arent held well together and i am truely disappointed in their service. they have no passion for this cusine and the worst part is the fish is old and i got sick from it vomiting blood and diarheaa.",1.0
"My family and I were here Sunday, March 8. The service was terrible, we were constantly looking for our waitress. I had to flag her down after 20 min so we could finally place our order. My son was literally gagging while eating his kids meal burger and said that it didn't taste good. When we finished our meal, we ordered 3 milkshakes to go (one kid size, 2 regular size). The waitress brought us our shakes and the cups were only filled half way. When I asked why the adult shakes were the same size as the kid shake, she said for some reason that's just the way the guy in the back did it. I asked for them to add more and she gave me an attitude.
An hour after we left, my son ended up getting sick and after speaking to the other people in our group, everyone who ordered a burger got sick.
I've eaten at Red Robin many times but this was my first time at this location. I will NEVER eat here again. The meat was obviously no good and the service was awful!",1.0
"Won't be going back here--cute spot but food is not very good, service is weird, and we felt sick afterward. First, on a Monday night when the restaurant was half-full, they did not have enough menus for our group (and one of the menus they gave us was for brunch). Two people in our group then distinctly disliked their wines by the glass and the cheapest wines by the glass were $10, which is way too high at a burger place. Then  my ""truffle"" grilled cheese was just a piece of regular cheese on regular bread--neither component was notable--and I literally could not taste the truffle. And I'm pretty sure that the ""taro root"" in the accompanying salad was actually just a crushed Taro Chip out of a bag. And it cost $14!!! If you're going to give me a mediocre grilled cheese that I could have made at home, don't charge me more than like $8. And the wait staff walked around the table with a water jug, but only poured water for people who specifically asked for it (even if the person next to them was visibly out of water). Then after we got home, we both felt nauseous all night. No thank you, Rye House.",1.0
Stay away unless ecoli is your idea of a good time. Within 24 hours of eating here two friends and I were in an emergency clinic with ecoli poisoning. The burgers weren't even close to worth it. You've been warned.,1.0

"We came here for brunch on a Sunday for my friends birthday. The ambiance was cute- middle eastern themed and open air and the food was delicious but we all got sick after eating here! 

Such a shame because it was really good but definitely not worth getting sick for!!!",1.0
"The server was awful... She was completely unable to answer any of our questions. 
The food was mediocre at best. Nothing had actual taste or flavor because everything was way to spicy. The calamari was so chewy and it was not cooked right. For ten dollars you hardly get a handful of it by the way! 
That night and the next morning we all got sick from it as well!",1.0
"Went for brunch a couple of weeks ago and it was terrible. The bloody mary was chunky and did not taste appetizing,  our group had to send back coffee because it tasted like instant coffee. We had to send back a tuna dishes because it did not look or smell well for an appetite.  the worst part was 2 people of our group got sick 1 hour after eating at the restaurant. It was the only place we ate at that day. All-in-all it was a terrible establishment that offered its guests poison for food. The medical bills I had to pay for being sick shows the proof. P.s they pour water in their mimosas.  Just disgraceful place.",1.0
Lunetta food poisoned me and my husband!!! Three days later and we're still not fully recovered.  Gastric apocalypse.,1.0
"Absolutely awful. This is your typical Chinese takeout hole-in-the-wall so of course the decor is expectedly nothing special. It is quite a shock, however, when it's not just dingy and unfurnished but also questionably sanitary. Not only did the sticky, grime-covered walls and floors need cleaning but their food prep was abysmally unappetizing as well. Their general cooking equipment all looked as if they needed to be replaced or thoroughly scrubbed. While we were ordering our food, a man in the back was washing out a wok and all he did was spritz it with hot water. No dishwashing soap, no sponge... I'm not an expert on wok cleaning procedures but I'm fairly sure spraying it down with hot water isn't enough. The commercialized coca cola fridge that most Chinese take-out places use for storing beverages, they used for storing buckets of fried chicken as well. Ignoring the fact that fried chicken has no place at a Chinese take-out place, no matter how Americanized the joint is, this chicken wasn't even appetizing. Over-fried and who knows how many days old, this chicken is probably heated up in a microwave for overly brave customers. This beverage fridge turned fried chicken fridge was also in need of a major scrubbing, its glass door already yellowed over with grime and grease.

But enough about the general squalor of the place... what about the food? Well, there's not much to say about that other than the fact that nothing was appetizing, nothing was fresh, and both of us got stomach aches afterwards. The General Tso's Chicken was dry and overcooked, and the cold noodles were just disgusting (something about the sauce did not sit well with us and I've had enough cold noodles at other joints to know that this is not how cold noodles are supposed to taste).

The service only added insult to injury. They weren't terrible but they were a bit snarky and on edge, like we had come to inspect their restaurant. If you're so ashamed of the state of your restaurant that you're treating customers like inspection officers, giving them a wary suspicious eye, then you're definitely doing something wrong.

Food: 1/5 -- Cold, dry, overcooked, and causes gastrointestinal distress
Service: 1/5 -- Snarky and on edge
Atmosphere: 1/5 -- Absolute squalor

Overall: 1/5 -- We went to this restaurant for its convenient location... we left with a bag of poisonous take-out food.",1.0
Waited over 2 hours for food. When it came half the food was cold. The drinks were terrible and best of all gratuity was included which is not stated on the menu.  They ran out of mac and cheese and cornbread.  The bacon wrapped bacon was the most insane thing I have ever seen on a plate. I wouldn't give it to a dog. All six people who ate felt sick after and one person threw up. While we were there 2 other tables got up and left because of the poor service. We complained to the owner and he didn't care.,1.0
"First thing first, the mac is dank. The staff is friendly and I lined their drinks. It's reasonably priced and the portions are huge. 

Points off for quality. My friend and I both had mild food poisoning (so much pooping) after eating a small mac. I only assume this was due to substandard cheese used.",1.0
"Place was empty when we went in for a quick bite.I was not satisfied with the service.The waitress apologized for the wait saying it was busy, although there was only one other table being waited on. Took about an hour to get just 3 rolls. They prioritize strangely. Take-out before the eat-in customers. My sushi rolls were missing ingredients. Later that night my partner and and I felt sick. They served the worst sushi I have had by far.",1.0
I recently went to this restaurant. It was not good! The food made me and my s.o. sick --it was covered in deep grease. The charizo was just cheap sausage! This would all be fine if it wasn't slightly overpriced. My s.o. had to take a Bayers after the meal because he literally felt like he was having a heart attack! For drinks its a cool spot--but that is about it! The waiter was sweet and helpful and its too bad he had to serve such shitty food.,1.0
"I came - I tried and It will definitely be a longtime before I return. IF I EVER do return. Like most people who come to this restaurant I was mainly attracted to their featured drinks.
First, when I arrived the restaurant was not at all what I expected. It is very small and far from what I remember the sugar factory in Las Vegas looks like. I expected the restaurant to have a plush and expensive look but it was not at all like that. The tables and seating looked very cheaply made and worn. The nicest part of the restaurant is the bar and the chandeliers throughout the restaurant. The candy section in the front was not inviting because my friends and I noticed that some of the product packages on display were very dusty which should have made me run. 
I chose to try this restaurant on my birthday unfortunately and came with three other friends. Most of us arrived at about the same time but one friend was running late. When we explained this to the hostess she seemed to have a little attitude and instructed us that all people in the reservation must be present in order to be seated. However, waiting at the bar became difficult because the place is so small. I eventually asked her to seat our party without the fourth person and lied that the fourth person would just be excluded.
We were soon seated a table with four chairs and I promptly used the extra seat for my bag and once our fourth person arrived I called her over to sit. The hostess said nothing but she did glare our way for a while.
When were given menus they were difficult to read because the place is kept so dark. .
Three of us order their burger and one friend ordered a breakfast/dessert entrée (waffles). The food tasted good but nothing special as most reviews stated. The drinks however, were very inventive and delicious. I ordered the lollipop goblet and after the ohhh ahhh of watching it bubble it was basically a sweet, candy tasting drink that I could drink like Kool-Aid. I didn't finish my goblet and I didn't taste any alcohol in my drink but I sure felt the alcohol when I stood up after dinner. After dinner we all agreed that we would return in the future for drinks but not for the food.
The next morning when I was dealing with symptoms of food poisoning I didn't immediately blame the sugar factory until another friend who the burger entrée said she had been sick with food poisoning symptoms as well. We realized there was a reason one burger looked so different from the other two-it probably was the only freshly made burger! I was so sick that I submitted a food poisoning complaint via 311. Thanks sugar factory for giving me food poisoning on my birthday",1.0
"Was here a few nights ago. While I would like to have said I enjoyed this place, I think I got a bit of food poisoning instead. Not sure what it was. Friends and I ordered the big platter of oysters, clams, shrimp, tuna tartar and salmon tartar. By the time dinner was over I had to make a run to the ladies room! The next 24 hours I felt miserable. Didn't get nauseas or throw up but spent time in el bano. Thought it was my lunch but turns out my friend was uneasy after dinner when she got home as well. Otherwise place looks nice and the service was good. Just wish I didn't have a bad experience with the food (which had tasted good so I'm not sure what happened??)",1.0
Omg. Do not eat here!!! I know the prices are great - hence why we ordered - but my roommate and I have had the worst food poisoning ever after both eating sweet and sour chicken and fried rice from here. Im going on my 36th hour of this. Seriously hell on earth. Stay far away from this place !!!!,1.0
"So I use to frequently this place with the previous owners who were the best. Since they sold the new owners are the worst any and every time we've attempted to eat here, my boyfriend and I have gotten sick. The sauce dishes are usually oily and under seasoned and they are down right nasty......yes I said nasty. They touch all things with ungloved hands after they've scratched their face.....nose etc and touch dirty money.

And trust the consistent pending grade from the health dept confirms what my stomach has told me. And I'm sorry that they have gone down hill since they are so conveniently located around the corner from my apt when the late night cravings hit for wings in ketchup and hot sauce.",1.0
"I've given this place several chances because I really wanted to like it. Not only is this spot two blocks from my apartment, it has a cool vibe and the owner is incredibly friendly. 

That being said, I was preeettty taken aback by my last couple of experiences. To note, Teany's is really small, so even when it's full (which never happens), it shouldn't take much effort to make sure all tables are tended to. We were one of 3 tables around noon on a Saturday and I literally had to walk up to the front counter to get our waitress' attention. By the time our food arrived, we were starving and promptly dug in.....BIG mistake. Two bites in to my salad, I noticed a red fuzz was covering my greens. I said something to my friends, and they too started finding bits of red fuzz throughout their salads. GROSS. Our waitress took the entrees off of our bill, but we were all sick to our stomachs the rest of the afternoon.

Bad experience #2: My friend and I were desperate for dessert at 9 p.m. on a Sunday when most places were closed. Teany's was still open, so we popped in to check out the menu once more. Ice cream caught my eye. Ice cream is safe, right? Nope. Wrong. I ordered two scoops of hazelnut for $3.50 a scoop and was literally served two spoonfuls of melted cream in a glass cup. I ate the entire thing in 10 seconds....and I wasn't racing my friend. $7 for some flavorless mush. Super.

I was rooting for you, Teanissimo....wudda shame.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this place and our dining experience last night, but unfortunately the fact is that we both suffered stomach problems after the meal. I'm not sure what could have caused it since we had shared everything throughout dinner, and we both did not eat during the hours prior to the meal (in anticipation for it). We were seated promptly at 9:45pm. My boyfriend had already started feeling uneasy in the middle of the 2nd course and ended up only eating half of his entree. Around 1am, when I got home, was when I started getting gut-wrenching pain and was confined to the bathroom for a while. 

However, this doesn't take away from what was otherwise a wonderful evening at the restaurant. There were complimentary treats peppered in between courses which was a nice touch. Our server noticed that my boyfriend didn't like his cocktail very much and removed it from the bill for us. Attentive and great service all around. Our courses were also good, but dessert was just alright. 

What we ordered (Dining Room pre-fixe)
+ drinks: passion iced tea, crossfire cocktail
+ 1st course: pasta w/ bolognese, beef tartare
+ 2nd course: pork loin, striped bass
+ dessert: chocolate plate, selection of sorbets

Hopefully, the aftereffects were just a one time mishap. For a place of such prestige, I did not expect to go home and feel sick after my meal.",1.0
"The WORST sushi I've ever had. And that was prior to all three of us getting sick! Restaurant was empty at 8:30 on a Saturday and now I know why. We had edamame which was good but the sushi was 100% inedible. Couldn't agree more with the reviewer below about the ""threesome"" roll - the worst of the worst. 

All of it was warm (even the raw rolls) and you could tell the fish had been sitting out. Makes my stomach turn just thinking about it! We stopped after having a few bites and realizing how terribly un-fresh it was. 

Scarily, the waitstaff acted like this happened all the time and kept apologizing as if they knew how low the quality was! And the manager would only refund us for the spicy tuna and salmon rolls which even he had to admit we're warm once he felt them. We left a huge uneaten plate of sushi behind and memories of the worst dining experience to date in NYC.

If you go to fatty fish, make sure you bring a very strong stomach with you. This place won't be in business long making people sick like it does.",1.0
"You want some good,  authentic chinese food? Come here.  The food is consistently good, and the servers know my family pretty well now.  Fried salt and pepper squid and the steamed seabass are really good.   For the adventurous types,  give the fish maw soup a try.  The sautéed vegetables are phenomenal,  don't skimp on the greens (especially the yu choy).  The only thing that holds this place back from 5 starts is that one time a few of us got a touch of food poisoning.  But hey, we like to live life a little dangerously too.",1.0
"Terrible terrible brunch..... 2 hr unlimited = small plates, weak drinks, and 1 waiter for the entire restaurant.  Employees spend most of the time drinking at the bar not paying attention to customers.  They also ran out of Champagne 45 mins into the 2 hr brunch.....better hope you like cheap vodka after that.   Oh and the 3 ppl in the group who ate meat dishes all felt sick later that night....but im sure that just a coincidence.  There are plenty of great unlimited brunches in the city.....skip this one for sure.",1.0
"Holy incompetent operation.  Our whole dinner party got severely ill after eating at Sing Kee with vomit and diarrhea.  Note that TWO other Yelp reviewers below had hair in their food and one had a worm.  One provided photos.  Also, note the Yelper below who had the experience of a staff taking his soup to the garbage without first checking to see if he was done, then returning the same soup from the GARBAGE to his table when he complained - REALLY?! - this is how you run a restaurant?  The health department should shut this place down.  Like other Yelp reviewers, we experienced the EXTREMELY RUDE staff too.  It turned out to be a very aggravating night.  So, on the eve of Lunar New Year, this otherwise empty joint got a little bit of business.  They were beside themselves with frazzle, losing the reservation of the irate guy and his party of five ahead of us (they went next door to Ken's Asian Taste), which is what we should have done. We had a reservation and ended up waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes.  We NEVER would have waited that long, but they strung us along - half an hour, another 20 minutes, another 15 minutes, another 15 minutes, you're next.  During our wait, we saw that this place was chaotic beyond belief with no visible manager on site, the woman hostess running around like a chicken without a head with no power to make anything happen, and the wait staff aggravated and rude.  Several just ignored us when we called on them to place our orders. One said he'd be right back and never returned! HOLY CRAP!  I've never in my life experience such disregard for customers.  They didn't care if customers left and many did.  While we were waiting, they got yelled at by two different people, each waiting an hour and a half to two hours for their take out order.  A staff person told one of the people - oops, your order never went in to the kitchen, but it's going in now - after an hour (!) and them saying it's almost ready periodically.  That guy lost his temper.  The other, an older woman, never got her order despite waiting more than an hour.  She, joined by another lady, yelled at them for several minutes at the top of their lungs, creating more of an unpleasant atmosphere for diners - but who can blame them.  We sat at the front of the restaurant, so it was extremely chaotic.  We should have left this drama, but it was New Year's Eve and we every place is busy that night.  So, we sucked it up and stayed.  We just wanted to eat and leave. This place cannot run a restaurant.  Save yourself hours of aggravation and food poisoning.

"On Sunday, Dec. 21, daughter and I had mushroom pizza, wife did not.  12 hours later, daughter and I, but not wife, got sick with same symptoms--vomiting, diarrhea, fever. Place has ""Grade Pending"" sign from NYC DOH.  We should have known better.",1.0

"A friend saw the reviews and recommended this restaurant to us since I was visiting NY for the first time. We were able to get a reservation for 6:00 pm...when we showed up, the happy hour was just finishing...so we had to wait. While we waited my wife ask a worker what dish would he recommend he said ""I don't eat from this place"" (should've been a warning sign for us) but since we were already there we waited. They finally sat about 15 min after our reservation time and the waitress came and took our drink and dinner order...she was quite pleasant, it's a shame that would be the last time we saw her.( never returned). My wife and I ordered the Mac n cheese, feijoda and okra fries. The feijoda was supposed to have oxtail in it..there was none. The mac n cheese was ok ...so were the fries. The restaurant was filthy..napkins thrown on the floor and when I went to the bathroom there was vomit all over the stall and floor. After paying we waited another 10 min just to get our change, then on the taxi ride back we both began to feel ill....It was a horrible dining experience.
Food made us sick..horrible service...filthy appearance.",1.0
"We were excited to see a restaurant with so many positive reviews on Seamless but unfortunately had the WORST ordering experience! 
The order was OVER 40min late with a consistently busy phone line. They forgot one of my drinks and the incompetence did not stop there! We received a dry ""steak"" burrito in a soggy wet tortilla which was  just rice and dry steak meat no cheese and no guacamole (apparently their listing provides false information!) We also received nacho chips which were extremely mushy and soggy with BLACK burned chips sticking out the sides and rancid tasting ""chorizo"" that then gave us food poisoning and of course the gaucamole was AGAIN false advertising. 

Food was not as described, was disgusting and old, and to top they forgot our drink. Would certainly NOT recommend and am honestly suspicious of the positive reviews at this point.",1.0
"I spent $200 eating here for two people and as soon as we got home, my dining partner threw up. He doesn't drink so it was probably the hamachi tartare. 

Our appetizers -- the hamachi and a roasted cauliflower salad -- were NOT good. The roasted cauliflower salad was cold and slimey, I really expected more for $15 but it was just a small, cold pile of vegetables. The hamachi was well seasoned but tasted off and we didn't realize how bad it was until we got home and got sick. 

The entrees were good though. The ribs and stuffed quail were phenomenal. 

But I'm highly disappointed that we paid so much for this meal and both got sick afterward. I definitely won't go back and wouldn't recommend it. Id rather go somewhere with a little less ambience if it meant lower prices and not ending up ill !",1.0
"I cannot even begin to describe how terrible the quality of this restaurant was.  Let's begin by saying that the food gave me a stomach ache, and it gave my girlfriend diarrhea.  That is just the beginning.  The water was undrinkable.  It tasted like their faucets have not been cleaned in over a decade.  Some of the food was tainted with whatever funky flavors were in the water.  If all of that isn't bad enough, well, the prices are completely outrageous for the amount of food we received.  The side dishes that came with our meal were pathetic.  The amount of Kimchi would not even suffice for one person, let alone three people, which is what our $115 order was supposed to serve.  The quality of the Kimchi was a joke, which is actually funny considering that this is supposed to be a Korean restaurant.  The amount of meat we were served might be enough for one person but certainly not three.  There are plenty of really great Korean BBQ in NYC, but this is not one of them.

This may be some of the worst food I have ever had. Although some of the menu does sound intriguing and worth a try it was TERRIBLE. First of for a gastro pub I had to order 4 different beers before they had one I wanted. Apparently they were out of pretty much everything. I went with a large group and we ordered basically everything on the menu with the intention to share and I could honestly say out of the group of 10 I was with not 1 of us enjoyed anything. The service was god awful and we had the rudest waitress. My fiancée and myself were actually physically sick for a solid two days after eating there. Nothing comes out how it was described on the menu and although the ideas sound great and if pulled off right would probably be very good it is all half assed and done with crap ingredients very lazily. STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. it's a complete and total mess,1.0
"Be weary of street food our group of three all felt sick after eating here and can almost narrow it down to this food. It is a great deal, a fun part of town, and very filling but the spices will clean out your nose and depending on how you order kind of plain food. 

Order one dish per two people, lots of food comes with it!

If the line is long, go to the same stand on the other corner at this intersection run by the same people.

PROs: line moves fast, sit on the Goldman Sachs steps, filling food, good deal
CONs: be weary of street food, must have the stomach for the spices",1.0
"I have heard so much about this restaurant (scenery, crowd) but during my first experience I wasn't impressed.  Yes the scenery of the Hudson was amazing but the food and service wasn't worth the 18% tip that is automatically applied to the check.  With a party of six, the waitress didn't take everyone's drink order nor the entrée order at the same time. It wasn't until her performance was brought to her attention that she paid a little (just a little) more attention on our needs.  I ordered the chicken lollipop.  Not knowing what this dish would look like (I assumed it was just grilled chicken on shrewers), the entrée came out and the chicken was shaped into a round ball with a stick poking out.  With the lights being so dimmed, I couldn't tell what I was eating and all of the hot sauce placed on it (it didn't taste good at all)), I left half of the food on the plate.  My sister ordered the calamari (which was cold) and mixed greens with grilled shrimp along with the peach sangria.  By the end of the night, she didn't feel well and by the time she reached home she began to experience stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea.  By the end of the night, my feeling about this place was ""been there, done that"".  If I was to return back to this establishment, it would be for the drinks and the view only.",1.0
"The food was delish.   However hubby and I became sick with diarrhea  after eating the stake and mash potatoes I was also vomiting. When I made the reservation I Reyes to call back to find out how much time I should allow for the meal.  But there phone was r working.  
The meal took 45 mins and we were rushed no offers of second helpings for bread. My Accessaride was scheduled for 12 mid and I expressed this to the waiter however the white headed man with a chip on his shoulder was rude. I was Ina bs out of the bathroom due to there food.  The chunky man reading of cig smoke wearing a Hawaii shirt was even ruder and a liar. He wouldn't let us stay and use the restroom even though staff was inside the place. The nicest person there was the hostess. This meal was a huge letdown and for almost 300.00 a rip off of a groupon. Learned my lesson concerning groupon. No more.  I have a second groupon I won't be using.",1.0

"So everything was fine at first. We made reservations for 5 people on a Sunday night, which turned out to be unnecessary because it was quite empty when we arrived. The waiters were all very nice. They served fried eggs and dukbokki as banchan - not the banchan I'm used to and wasn't exactly delicious either but whatever.

We tried to order a dozen raw clams, was told they didn't have any. Tried to order raw oysters, but they didn't have any. We ordered the octopus hotpot and they didn't have any of the large octopus. Huh?????????? A seafood specialty restaurant at 7pm on a Sunday that doesn't have any clams, oyster, or octopus. Okay......

Luckily the hotpot we got was more than enough to fill us all up. The assortment of different seafood was awesome, but unfortunately the accompanying soup left much to be desired. Kind of bland and despite the reddish color, not at all spicy. Still pretty good though, so whatever.

...

Fast forward about 2 hours and I have a painful stomach ache. The next morning (today), my boyfriend has been violently throwing up. I asked the other people who ate with us if they experienced the same thing. They also said they felt ill afterwards. We all waited until the seafood was cooked thoroughly before eating (if anything, a lot of the stuff became overcooked) and it was also our last meal of the night so I don't think anything else could have cause us to all get sick.",1.0
"Went here for an anniversary dinner and was expecting good food AND good music. Unfortunately I only got one...

Decor and atmosphere was great. The lighting is appropriately dim with the prime focus being on the stage. The place is quite small but makes the experience that much better. The musicians are only 15 feet away from your table! The music itself was very good and surpassed my expectations. I would come back here just for the music if there wasn't a dining minimum.


For dinner my girlfriend and I each got the $38 prix fixe which includes an appetizer, main entree and desert each. 

For starters I had the popcorn shrimp and callamari which was very good. No complaints here. My girlfriend had the lobster bisque which was also good albeit a little different than the creamier bisques I am used to. 

The main entrees is where it starts to get bad. I paid the upcharge to get the steak and french fries. My steak was a large portion but overall pretty terrible. The meat was tough and lacked flavor. My steak contained two separate large pieces of cartilage that I had to awkwardly spit out midway through dinner. The fried onions they put on top were bitter and inedible (too much baking soda in the batter?). Would not recommend to anyone especially if you pay full price for it during non prix fixe weekend dinner.

My girlfriend ordered the sea scallops with bacon. At first I was shocked by the portion size (c'mon only 3 scallops on a bed of lettuce). They tasted OK but came out rather cold and nothing sounds worse to me than cold scallops.

Finally came desert. Once again these were good but nothing to write home about. The chocolate brownie desert they serve with prix fixe was hard and felt like i was going to flip over the tiny table while trying to break off a piece. I wasn't expecting much with the desert given the other reviews I've read on yelp and was satisfied with what I ended up getting. 

The terrible part of this experience came after dinner. No less than 20 minutes after leaving the restaurant and while on the subway back home we both came down with food poisoning. I'm pretty sure it was the sea scallops (cold and improperly cooked?). A great way to cap off an anniversary dinner thanks to Smoke Jazz Club! I definitely will not be coming back here.",1.0
"Originally, we thought of a 4 stars...
Although we encounter a few bummers during the night and this morning after having unslept on it... we are giving a 3 but really because we like Traif (same owners).

First, it was really cold inside. The AC was over cooling the place and it did not establish a comfortable mood for our dinner.

Cocktails were good but the only disappointing part is that with the ice cubes cocktail you really drink it when you are almost at dessert... Which is not a cocktail / aperitif anymore. The toasted black sesame - almond with house tequila was good .

The food comes first ready, first served , as Traif. Until there no problem... Except when they forget one of the most important ones : the sliders. 
The bone marrow taste was good, maybe not melting enough like butter and the beef tartare was not good.

The butterfish hamachi was good, the Mexican spicy edamame was good. The Coconut tuna was not pleasant and almost frozen... and the Brussels sprouts are fried so it removes all that deliciousness about them. 
Life and food is about balance... Not here.

The scallops were good, the foie gras was good, the ribs were ok.

We are still cold with goosebumps all over our arms and waiting for the sliders which never came. Meanwhile, someone refilled tap water on our bottled sparkling water. What a waste. One of us expressed it and the manager brought some sparkling water from the gun bar (sorry, that does not replace bottled sparkling water with minerals).

We thought of leaving at this point but again, because it's the same owners as Traif, we thought of not leaving on a bad note. So we gave the desserts a try.
We got the tres leche carrot cake and the maple flan. And that was good !!!
Pfiou.... Something at least alchemic and as fine as you can find next door. 

But one of us could not digest the food. He got sick during the night, and another one is still trying to calm an unhappy stomach.

We will not be back, we'll keep it at Traif only.",1.0

"Went here to celebrate a birthday.  The staff was absolutely great, very professional and friendly.  Excellent wine selection, not all of which were budget-busters.  

The appetizers- we had baked clams and tuna tartare- were unbelievably good.  Since it was a special occasion, we decided to splurge and try the Kobe steak and the Wagyu.  We requested rare but both came out medium.  The Kobe was incredibly flavorful, though at $125 for an 8-ounce portion it was extremely pricey.  The Wagyu tasted bland and no different than a regular steak at a regular restaurant- it was also over one hundred dollars and seemed absurdly overpriced for what was, in the end, a mediocre entree. 

As a coda, we were both very sick the next day, but since we were sharing everything I can't pinpoint which item caused the illness.  This was an overall disappointing experience and we won't be back- the service was just excellent, but the main attraction, the steaks, fell way short of our expectations.",1.0

That being said, the last time I went there with my roommate; he had the margherita with sausage and I had it with ham. Within 30 minutes of leaving we both got very SICK.  It was a long long evening and did not recover until the next day.  Extremely dissapointed.  It is not a cheap place to dine and that is unacceptable.",1.0
"When this place first opened, I heard the wait was super crowded because it was new and the only AYCE sushi place near 8ave. So I waited until the hype died down and tried it with my bf on a weekday night. It wasn't crowded. I came here several times because honestly, I thought the food was pretty good. I liked how their sushi rolls are smaller than other AYCE places so I don't get too full from one roll and can try more of the other stuff. The rolls are comparable to Sake, a huge competitor AYCE place. I loved their selection of appetizers. The mussels are good but I wish they'd stop adding egg to it. The squid is probably their best appetizer. I like the crispy tentacles. Honestly, the first time I came here to eat, I really liked the place because the sushi and appetizers were really good and comparable to Sake. I felt like it was the first AYCE sushi joint that matched up to Sake and it was within walking distance from my house so I stopped going to Sake after this place opened. 

However, the one experience I had here, after eating here about 3-4 times already, really left me disappointed. After dinner here one night with my bf, I had food poisoning. It was the first time I ever had food poisoning and it was literally the worst thing. I couldn't eat for a whole day because everything I ate, I threw back up. My bf did not have it as bad as I did but he had food poisoning too. Needless to say, we never went back after that time. We got a new favorite sushi joint now.",1.0
"The short of it: Extremely dry brisket, deceptive pricing, under average service, dessert that gave everybody stomach problems. 

Meh. I've been to this Dino BBQ one other time and remember it being delicious, so maybe this past Saturday night was just a fluke. But, I was super disappointed to say the least. 

I came with a group of 4 other friends, and we shared the sausage, cheese, and crackers appetizer. This was the highlight of our night. And it all went downhill from there. 

The first confusion and disappointment came when ordering. My best friend ordered the Tres Ninos (what was supposed to be a smaller portion of ribs, pork, and brisket) and I ordered the exact same but in combo form. Our waiter told us that my portion should have been larger. But, when the food arrived, our entrees were exactly the SAME SIZE. In fact, she seemed to get a larger portion than I did. Why, then, was her meal only $15.95, and mine $20.95? Not worth it. If you are okay with ordering the tres ninos, go down that route. The combo is a waste of money, and honestly feels a bit deceptive. 

Another miss at the table was the brisket. Maybe we got a bad piece as a table, but the brisket was so dry. Now, I understand that it was lean brisket, but even then, the meat was tough and hard to chew. There was no juice, and only one person in our partner finished their portion. 

The next complaint I have was about the service. Our waiter was nice, but he was never there. We waited almost 30 minutes to get our check, and even longer to pay. When one of my friends needed a refill, he waited almost 30 minutes for another waitress to walk by. Even then, she told us she couldn't help us and we would have to wait for our waiter. When we explained that we've been trying to spot him for a long time, she just apologized and told us she'd let him know if she saw him. Are you serious? I understand the service policies put into place, but this was ridiculous. 


Finally, for dessert, our table shared two of the chocolate pies. These were DELICIOUS....until we all got home and all started feeling sick. Now, maybe it wasn't the pie, but a few members of our table definitely commented on feeling queasy after eating it. 


All in all, we spent over $150 at our table and were left disappointed. Again, maybe this was a fluke. But I would think twice about ever frequenting Dino BBQ again.",1.0
"Dear god, I used to love this place. I ate here every day when I worked in the area. As a vegan with Celiacs, it was an absolute delight to find a place where I could get gluten free Chinese food. 

My parents are in town, and we've been looking forward to it - my mother also has Celiacs, and hasn't had Chinese food since her diagnosis a few years ago. 

Among other things, we ordered the gluten free general tso's tofu. When the food arrived, we served up heaping plates, and started chowing down. I immediately spat out the general tso's. It was chicken, not tofu. Grubhub took care of it, and we had tofu within 30minutes. Hurray. 

Now my mother and I are taking turns being horrifically ill while my father cancels our evening plans. 

In addition, the delivery guy was the rudest, surliest delivery guy I have ever encountered. After not following the instructions that I put in the order initially, he actually threw the bag of food in my face when he redelivered. What? 

I've never had an issue before. I've also always done take out, not delivery, so maybe that's the issue. However, I probably won't be returning ever again. Poor service and poisoning aren't really a repeat.",1.0

"Me and my husband had a pretty terrible experience here yesterday. We were in the area and found this place on Yelp, decided to try it based on the fact that they have gluten free options in the menu and great reviews. We were even happy to wait about 20 minutes for a table.

I double checked with our waiter before ordering to make sure the food we ordered was gluten free. He assured me that the chicken satay appetizer was so we ordered that, and also a pad thai with duck and a massaman curry. All options were marked GF in the menu and the waiter assured me they were gluten free as well.

To my surprise the chicken satay came ON A BED OF BREAD. When the waiter realized that he just said ""if you don't eat the bread it's gluten free"". i was like ""ok..."". We both have non-celiac gluten sensitivities so we didn't think contamination would be an issue, plus I hate to be that customer that returns food or is picky, but I think it's pretty reasonable to order a menu item that is listed as GF and expect it to be, well, free of gluten.

At this point I am not sure but it's possible that some of our other food also contained gluten, maybe the sauce that came with the chicken or the duck/curry sauce. I've never gotten gluten poisoning at a restaurant before so I wouldn't say I am extremely sensitive, it's sounds more like the food that they list as GF is actually cooked with ingredients that contain gluten... not to mention the bread as well! Anyway as soon as we got on the train to go back home we started feeling sick, at this point we just thought we were tired, but by the point we got back home we were both having symptoms of gluten poisoning. Lots of abdominal pain, acid reflux, joint paint, migraine, several unpleasant visits to the bathroom, you get the point. I still feel terrible a day later, this thing has pretty much ruined my weekend.

I am pretty disappointed about the fact this place claims to have GF options but then the waiters/kitchen staff are pretty uneducated about what gluten actually is and that caused me and my husband to get pretty sick. The restaurant had nice decor and service, and the food was fresh, it is clearly very busy too, so I have no idea why they advertise all these gluten free options that don't really exist. Gluten free is not a fad diet but an actual lifestyle some people have to follow in order not to have chronic health issues. I am mad I spent about $60 on this place only to get really sick.",1.0

"This review is for the brunch experience, or lack there of. i will list the issues as following:

No utensils were provided to eat our meal with. 
The smoked salmon tasted store bought on sale in the discount isle. 
The bread (english muffin) was not even toasted. 
it took the wait staff over 40 minutes to bring us our check for the no utensil, no flavor, meal. Both my friend and i felt sick for several hours afterwards. 

i go out for good food and good ambiance, this one was neither and i agree there are much better brunch places in town, probably even a block down from this place.

"Went here with a friend on Wednesday night and enjoyed happy hour margaritas. They tasted gray and were not watered down.

"i would like to start this review off by saying i have never been dissatisfied enough to ever write a review. This restaurant is horrible, i ordered a dirty martini for my  husband and he poured vodka and olive juice into a glass and served it, yes i know these are the ingredients but being a former bartender i know this is a lazy job of serving a $30 drink, (it should be poured on ice, shaken up, then poured into your glass.) Next i would like to say the steak tartare came out on a plate looking like a raw sirloin burger straight out of the package. Also being a pregnant woman and having to stay away from certain foods because off bacteria and foodborn illness, i could never imagine getting sick from such a high end resturant. My husband and i couldn't stop vomiting 2 hours later after leaving this restaurant. Cipriani Downtown was a threat to my unborn child's health as well as ours. We will never be going back and highly recommend you don't either.",1.0
"Had a wonderful late lunch at this little spot on Bond Street, Great Neck. Nice atmosphere and very relaxed but expect to wait a bit to get served.  Great place for organic and natural foods. We ordered the fish taco (made of mahi mahi) and the wild salmon burger. Both were delicious and tasty.  Unfortunately by the time we got home we both had really bad diarrhea. 
Called the manager the next day to complaint about the bad fish and he made an excuse that it couldn't be a problem with the fish not being fresh. He said it might be the spices and that is usual. I said I wouldn't eat here if it is usual to get diarrhea eating their spices. He left it at that. I guess no responsibility for the good they serve. Best to eat elsewhere of that's the case.",1.0
"*Disclaimer* I went to Arepas on August 8th, which was a while ago, but I wasn't able to write this review until now. Even though it wasn't recent, I have to make sure people know why they should avoid this place like the plague.

At first glance, Arepas Cafe is a quaint and cozy Venezuelan restaurant. My girlfriend and I were looking for a new spot to enjoy in Queens, and a quick Yelp search led us to Arepas. I'm very particular about my food, so I don't really waste time on restaurants below 4 stars. Arepas had really great reviews and according to my fellow Yelpers the food was top notch. After seeing a few pictures on their page, I was sold and we decided to try it out. We were greeted by a friendly waitress and after looking over the menu, we started with the mini empanadas appetizers (chicken and shark). They wouldn't honor their sangria deal on Yelp but no big deal. For the main course,  I decided to order the Reina Pepiada arepas (chicken with avocado and mayo) and my girlfriend got the Pollo Mechado (shredded chicken). This is where the disaster began.  The food came out in a decent amount of time and the empanadas were pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but pretty good. At this point, we started to notice that our waitress wasn't very good. She kind of just disappeared after our main dishes came. Once they did come, I wasn't too impressed. My Reina Pepiada arepas had WAY too much avocado. It was basically like eating a plain avocado sandwich. I couldn't stomach it. It was so overdone I ended up ordering the baby shark/stewed chicken and cheese arepas. My girlfriend decided to take the remainder of  my avocado one home to hook it up a little. Her shredded chicken arepas was okay but average. We ate, we paid, we left. Where's the disaster you may ask?? The night of/day after, me and my girlfriend both started having severe stomach issues. This place actually gave us FOOD POISONING. We can't be sure what it was, but my guess was the shark or the avocado they served us. For a total of THREE days both of our stomachs were messed up. It ruined our entire weekend. We tried to call the restaurant and speak to the manager but we could never reach him. It's an absolute shame because we probably would have come back, but after this experience I'll never set foot in this place again !To solidify this deserved 1 star rating, the manager was reached out to several times immediately following the disaster and was never there... Atleast according to the people that answered the phone.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our one year anniversary on 10/18/14 with a getaway in NYC and decided to eat at this Bare Burger establishment prior to enjoying our long weekend of festivities. Both him and I are HUGE Bare Burger fans and visit the location in Astoria almost weekly (since it has opened!)  He ordered the Supreme (w/ beef) and I decided on the Country Bacon burger (w/ turkey meat/turkey bacon) and a basket of fries.  Almost immediately after consuming our lunch, my stomach started to feel funny.  I assumed it was because I just had a huge meal.  An hour after we left the restaurant, we both didn't feel so good. Three hours later, we were BOTH nauseous and had upset stomachs/gas/cramping.  That night both him and I were in and out of the bathroom ALL night; certainly NOT the way we intended to start our romantic weekend.  Luckily, he felt a little better by the morning while I, on the other hand, was absolutely miserable.  I continued to be nauseous, have cold-sweats and needed to use the bathroom at least 3x/hour.  I was so sick that we had to cancel some of our plans/reservations and forfeit deposits as well. We returned home and I went to Urgent Care as soon as possible which was Friday, 10/24/14.  Low and behold, EIGHT VIALS of blood, multiple stool samples, an Rx for heavy antibiotics/probiotics for 10 days (twice a day, I might add,) I come to find out that my entire intestinal lining has been shed secondary to having a PARASITE.  My physician is also testing me for HEPATITIS A.  Way to go Bare Burger!  

Words cannot explain how sickened and horrified I am and to be honest, Bare Burger 1st Ave should be ashamed of themselves.  I honestly knew something was ""off"" when I visited this location but I didn't want to say anything and instead kept my almighty faith in Bare Burger and its ability to please.  For those of you who have not tried Bare Burger, my recommendation is to not start at this location!!!!!  The quality of food is not worth the risk.  Not only is it disgustingly unsanitary, we had to beg the waiter to pause from his personal conversation behind the counter to provide us with water and to take our order (which was also taken improperly but we gave up in trying to call him over to give us what we originally ordered.)  We also sat there for about 18 mins after finishing our meal before we were offered dessert/the check. I would completely understand if it was busy but there were only about 10 other people dining at the time.  

At the end of the day, I am happy that I didn't have to be hospitalized and even happier that I am able to report my experience to the public so they don't judge all Bare Burgers based on their encounter with this one.",1.0

"Even being a foodie got me 4 times food poisoning, but This restaurant is the only place I did consider to sue.

I was born in Hunan Chang Sha so when they open the first restaurant in flushing I was super happy. The flushing one is still my favorite Hunan food in east coast,but the one in Manhattan is horrible. 


We ordered green peppers salted cured duck egg, It came up with eggplant and green papers 

Me :this is not what we ordered, the one shown on the menus pictures does not have eggplants. 

Waitress: "" our food is different from the menu pics.

Me: ""so why you use those pictures?

She say:"" it's just a reference 

Me: I went to your flushing location they made the exactly same food like the menu pictures.

Waitress:"" you want it or not? This is how we cook this dish""

We were so mad because of her attitude of course we say we want to return it.  

And the frog we order after we return that green paper dish, everything taste really really bad!!( I hope they didn't put anything bad in there because we got food poisoning after that)

We order 6 dishes that night, only the sour beans and the Chang Sha mi fen taste as good as flushing one. Everything else taste so bad.

And guess what, three out of four of us all got food poisoning after we got home.

 When bad things happens you should find out the reason so you could prevent the similar thing from happening again. No matter how bad I'm craving for my hometown food I will never go back

"Just came from this restaurant with my family 8/31/2014. The food was disgusting.  There were fruit flies inside everywhere.  We were fighting flies off of our plates and face so we couldn't enjoy our meal.  Additionally we told the servers several times that we were vegan. We got pork on the first try. They re-fired our meal, it was saturated in lemon, barely paletable and now 2 out of the four members in our party feel really sick.  We paid $185.00 (for four people) honestly the meal was over priced and sincerely out of their depth.  For 185 I expect to walk out very satisfied.  All in all, I dont recommend going here.

"Don't go to Sushi X unless at least 9 of these 12 things apply to you: Japanese, over the age of 50, looks rich, has dying taste buds, has a stomach of steel, doesn't like having friends eat dinner with you, wants to prank your friends, has a fetish for food poisoning, enjoys eating bad tasting sushi, loves bad service, enjoys making bad decisions, and loves being ripped off.

You would be much better off going to the Chinese buffet, a block away. Never again will I or my friends go to Sushi X. 

For a celebration, my friends and I went to Sushi X. This restaurant was not even half-full during dinner time. After standing for 5 minutes and impatiently staring at the waitresses chatting with each other in Japanese, we decided to just seat ourselves. As we were about to sit in one of the circular tables with cushioned seats, a waitress became alert and rushed over to us. I thought, ""Finally we are going to get some service."" I was wrong; she came over to us and told us we cannot sit there, as if it was some type of VIP seats. She decided to seat us in the most uncomfortable spot possible: right by the entrance of the store with tiny wooden chairs. 

We considered getting the dinner buffet, but after noticing it was a rip off since the sushi was not even prepared ahead of time, we decided against it. We decided to order the $80, 100 piece party platter, but we weren't sure how many this would feed or what it would contain so we asked the waitress about it. As we asked questions, I could clearly tell that she had no idea what she was talking about, I'm not even sure she noticed that she was being asked a question. We asked her what was in the party platter and she responded with ""Many different things."" We asked her what was the ""different things,"" and she said, ""California roll and Sushi."" We continued this pointless questioning and ended up regretting it as it just confused us even more. I asked, ""How many people does this typically serve,"" and she said, ""Depends on how hungry you are."" I followed up by asking, ""Well, how many people share a party platter"" and she responded with, ""It depends."" I was getting slightly irritated and asked her about what ""it depends on,"" and she looked at me as if she already answered this, ""how hungry you are."" If there was an award for the least helpful waitress ever, she would have easily won it. 

When the party platter came after 45 minutes of waiting, the waitress let it drop on the table. Yeah thanks for the great service. I also noticed that there was nowhere near 100 pieces and the rolls were pretty short and cut pretty thin compared to other places. The sashimi was also cut into extremely small pieces so perhaps this is how they counted their ""100 pieces,"" though clearly it still did not add up to 100 pieces. Too bad my friend already ate a piece before we had the time to complain and the waitress saw this, else we would have asked for a refund on the spot. Knowing this irritating waitress, she would have complained her head off and said we ate the 20 something pieces that was clearly missing on the plate since she gave us the 80 piece set for the price of the 100 piece set.

As for the actual sushi, there was 1 roll that tasted nice, everything else was pretty terrible. The sashimi was especially bad and nowhere near being considered fresh. Personally, I think that lukewarm sashimi can work pretty well but this sashimi wasn't even lukewarm (or close to bodily temperature) rather this sashimi was room temperature warm. It was really disgusting to eat the sashimi as it had a slimy, gooey texture. Eventually, my friends and I could not stand poisoning ourselves any longer (some of us got food poisoning the next day) and made this into a punishment game. We played some group games and the loser would have to eat a piece of sashimi, most of us would have rather eaten a mouthful of wasabi, but of course they skimped on that too. 

After that terrible meal, we asked for a check. Much to our surprise, the cost was higher than we expected. Apparently, the gratuity was built into the check. I don't exactly remember correctly, but I remember being extremely shocked that it was 15-20% and I think it was on top of the tax cost too, I mean who does that. I fully intended to leave some tip (my friends refused to) and was going to leave a $5. I actually felt insulted by the gratuity amount in the check and complained, again she just brushed it off and started going bonkers. We ended up paying because we wanted to get out of here and go to the Pizza Hut, 3 blocks away, because we weren't even half full. We paid about $4 over the check amount and waited for change to use that for pizza money. The waitress ended up forgetting how much we gave her and argued with us. I told her to just keep it and we just left after that to head to Pizza Hut and actually get a decent meal.

This is a blemish in my food history and I do not even know how this has anything above a 1 star rating on Yelp.",1.0
We went here one night because we heard many good things about it and we were not impressed. The margarita pizza was ok at best. We ordered the famous artichoke pizza and after a few bites it made us sick. It just wasn't for us. Too thick and creamy. There's plenty of pizzerias just as good.,1.0

"I came here for dinner after a convention with a group of friends. When we walked in, we were met with a chaotic atmosphere and a frantic waiter who rushed us to our table. After looking through the dinner menu, we asked for the lunch menu. The waiter looked at us with disgust, snatched the dinner menu from us and threw the lunch menus on our table. Our group of 8 people, shrugged this off and proceeded on ordering food. ALL of our dishes came in under 5 minutes, which to me was a red flag. I got the shrimp Lo mien to share with my friend, it tasted ok but it was extremely greasy and unhealthy. The other members of my group got soup or some type of meat. As we were eating and talking, the waiter kept coming and hurrying us to finish which is one of the rudest things that I have ever seen a waiter do. After we finished, our waiter THREW the check at us and we left only a $3 tip. As we were paying, however, the waiter stood on top of us and waited for us to pay. When he was unsatisfied with the tip, he became angry and demanded we pay him more. We refused and left the restaurant in a hurry, not wanting to be in the hostile environment for any longer. The experience did no end there though because half of the group experienced a violent episode of food poisoning the next day. I am convinced that the devil lurks within the walls of that establishment. We will never eat here again!",1.0
Absolutely the worst.i got e coli or staff infection from here this past Thursday went to the doctor today after vomiting and burning up for two days after eating here. Doctor states it was definitely what I ate and all I ate was ribs with mashed  potatoes. I told my wife the potatoes taste funny I only ate one bite but it was enough. My wife and other people I know have gotten sick before eating here. I will never eat there again and neither will anyone I know. I would give less than one star if I could,1.0
"I've gotten lunch from Mexicue once and had their 'Rice 'N Greens Bowl' which came with romaine, Mexican brown rice, corn salsa, white cheddar, spicy lime dressing, salsa, and chicken. It wasn't bad, though this particular bowl seemed to lack cohesiveness. It just felt like a bunch of ingredients thrown together without much thought. 

Though it's close to my office, I haven't been back for lunch since. My coworkers on the other hand go all the time. Recently, however, a number of them became mysteriously ill with some kind of food poisoning. And everyone who did had eaten Mexicue within the last of couple days. It's entirely possible it was a coincidence, but it's enough to keep us from going again.

Food aside, a few of us came to Mexicue for Happy Hour a couple weeks ago, excited to try their $4 margaritas. They serve them in big, plastic cups from a machine. They tasted like lemonade. Skeptical of whether they had any tequila, we decided to ask an employee. They confirmed that they DO have alcohol, just not tequila. They use some kind of sweet agave liquor instead. After a huge plastic cup, a couple of us felt the slightest tinge of a buzz, but it was probably just a sugar high from all the agave. 

A margarita is defined as a cocktail made with tequila and citrus fruit juice, so I'd advise Mexicue not to market it as such.",1.0
"I've never gotten food poisoning as I was still eating before.  Finished the tofu sushi,  was 1/4 way through the vegetable chow fun and the nausea and explosive diarrhea started (and still continue 3 hours later). Husband is feeling it too and he ate a completely different meal.. I'm surprised because when I got the food I thought to myself that it looks super healthy and less greasy than other places. The chow fun was a light color not the usual darker brown that usually looks heavy. 

I feel so unwell and I'm beginning to think the kitchen might really be as filthy as the outside looks.  I really hope they washed their hands before touching my food.

"If you want a place to drink bottled beer and people watch. 5 Stars!

If you want a place with good food, real margaritas, that is clean and seems like they give a shit. 1 Star!

Today I'm sick as a dog and I have no doubt it was due to my unfortunate visit to Mother Burger...and the Mother lode of germs most likely in my food and drink. 

I'm usually not hard to please. And I really hate giving a bad review but sometimes places just miss the mark. I really just expected better. Maybe it was just a rare bad day and a bad experience. I totally understand that. But this was my bad experience and I don't like places that make me sick. I'm a huge fan of Bar Rescue and this place could use a rescue.

We sat inside, my friends were already there and had downed one of their famous bulldogs. My friend went to the bar and ordered a bulldog for me. And I enjoyed a round with my friends and eventually we ordered. 

I ordered the Chicken Sandwich and fries. I checked with the waitress that it was fresh chicken, as I'd been to a couple places lately that pre-cook their chicken and just nuke it last minute. If that was the case then I'd rather just order a burger. No biggie. She assured me it was fresh but made sure I understood it was not on a bun but on a long piece of Texas toast. Perfect, order placed. It came out fast, a bit too fast. The chicken was cut in half and put inside a small burger bun. The pickles seemed old, like they hadn't been in juice all afternoon, the lettuce wilted, the tomato lifeless, the fries greasy and tired like they had been sitting or refried. Not real impressed but not one to complain so I ate it. Not terrible but not something I would ever order again or come back for. 

That's when I ordered another bulldog. The waitress brought it. A plastic cup half filled with the cheap frozen sugar water they pass off as a margarita. No idea if they washed the bottle or not, she grabbed the whole bottle with her hands, holding the lime shoved into the opening and plunged it into my drink. Oh yum I thought. My gut said it was a bad idea to drink it but I did. Today I'm paying the price.

It was then that I started looking around. Everything was filthy. Tables weren't just worn but wore out. Decorations weren't designed to look rustic and old, they were rustic and old. Our table was sticky. Anyway, I could go on but I've said my piece. The only solid thing this place had going for it was cheap prices and location. What could be an amazing place is just mediocre. So grab a beer, enjoy your time with your friends, avoid the margaritas and eat elsewhere. There's a million places within a block that are so much better. 

Sorry Mother Burger, hope you get your act together. I need to go take another Tums. Thanks!

"My boyfriend and I had our first date here a year ago when they first opened and the service and presentation of the food was not great so we made a plan to come back in a year.  We decided to go exactly a year ago from the date we first went which was this past Sunday 5.31.15. The food and presentation of it has gotten better. The restaurant looks more put together. The bar was fully stocked and drinks were good. The food was ok. To start, we had the corn and crab mac & cheese. Very tasty so we were pretty anxious about the main course. I had the steamed snapper which wasn't actually steamed but fried and then heated up in a pan with sauce and peppers. Kinda of like an escovitch style with sauce. I also had the rice and peas and asparagus. The rice and peas was sappy and the asparagus was grilled and topped with a bunch of salt and pepper. My boyfriend had the crab legs. They definitely were not fresh but the sauce it was in was tasty. The service was better seeing that we were the only two people in there at the time and a few others at the bar. The worst part about the whole thing is that I woke up in the middle of the night with hives and food poisoning as did my boyfriend. I know it had to be something I ate there because I literally ate nothing the whole day preparing my appetite for this spot. So with that said my boyfriend and I have vowed never to dine here again.

This internal e-mail went out today at my office shortly after lunch:

""A few consultants ordered lunch from Bento today and have become sick.  While we are not sure yet if this is food poising and if Bento is actually the cause,  we wanted to act on the side of caution and recommend that no one eat takeout food today from Bento.
 
Thank you - and hope everyone has a nice weekend!""

So... looks like we dodged a bullet.

Edit: confirmed Scombroid Food Poisoning by the hospital.",1.0
"Avoid at all cost. FOOD POISONING. I went there a couple weeks ago, we ate different food and all got sick a couple hours later. The outdoor terrace looks nice but don't get lured in there, Amsterdam is full of better restaurants including Indian places if you're into that (even if I'm not a big fan of the other at least I'm not sick after eating there).",1.0
"I came here in a group of 9 for a birthday dinner this past Saturday. It was surprisingly empty but perhaps it was because it was already 8:45pm. We were seated in the back and there was a really nice, warm breeze. I felt like I was in a resort in Mexico. 

I ordered the prickly pear frozen margarita, which tastes like plain margarita. By the way I had no idea prickly pear is actually NOT pear! It was fairly strong and I already felt somewhat tipsy from it halfway through. I did not finish the drink because all the ice melted towards the end and it was gross. We ordered the el valiente guacamole which I really enjoyed. It definitely had a kick, maybe even two kicks. I ordered the mojo marinated skirt steak for my entree. 

Despite ordering my steak in medium, it was more like medium-well to even well done. Nonetheless I thought the steak was tasty, especially since I dunked it with chimichurri sauce. Mmm, I love chimichurri. I didn't care for the mashed potatoes which actually tasted like sweet potatoes in my opinion. I tried my husband's spice rubbed NY strip steak and that was definitely way overcooked. It was also very bland and just not good at all. Poor guy, he was so disappointed he was still complaining about it the next day to me. 

Even with all that I had a pretty good time, since I liked the ambience and was with awesome company. Our waitress was very nice although she did switched two of my friends' drinks. She did a good job overall handling out party size. 

Shortly after I left the restaurant I started having stomach pains. We went straight home, getting home about an hour after eating. When I got home I was so nauseous and felt like I had to throw up. I had diarrhea. At some point I was walking across my room, I had a sudden wave of disorientation and confusion, and fell onto my floor where my husband found me when he heard the ""thud."" I felt fine the next day with just some mild queasiness in the belly. Honestly I have no idea what could have been the cause but it was very, very strange.

My husband had some uneasiness in the stomach that night as well but nothing aside from that. I had two friends who ordered the same skirt steak entree as me who didn't have any issues so... It's a mystery.",1.0
"I went here for the first time on Thursday 5/21 with 2 friends and honestly was not the least bit impressed. The food was just ehh, nothing really had enough flavor to it, and I was severely disappointed.  To top that off, I woke up Sat am with horrible stomach pains, and had stomach issues that lasted me a full week.  I didn't think to even talk to my 2 friends I dined with, thinking I just got some virus, and after speaking with them today, they both had the SAME EXACT issue. So we're convinced it was something from eating at Cosme.  They either didn't handle the food properly and passed on some of the bacteria to us, or something terrible is going on there.  There's no way all 3 of us would have been sick with the same stomach issue by coincidence..and this was not a fever/flu type of issue. Needless to say, I will NOT be going back there ever again!",1.0
"Let me start with the two most important words of this review ...""Food Poisoning"".  After reading glowing reviews and a write-up in the local paper about this place, I had to check it out. I ordered delivery that took over an hour after being told it would take 30 minutes. I can live with that. This is New York after all. The food, when it finally arrived, was a bit cold but tasty. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and chicken sandwiches and split them between us. 

The 48 hours that followed had every one who ate the sandwiches projectile vomiting and dealing with explosive diarrhea. Personally, spending 8 hours in the ER getting fluids was not my idea of a good time. 

As I write this, I am still dealing with having to be within running distance of the bathroom. 

Eat here at your own peril.",1.0
"In terms of taste, the meats here are pretty standard, like most halal carts. Their portions are a little smaller compared to other locations in Queens, such as Kew Gardens or by St. Johns. However, every time I eat the food here, I get diarrhea. I'm pretty sure its the white sauce. A friend of mine mentioned that he also had diarrhea when he eats from this cart, so it's not just me. Overall, the prices and taste are standard, but I would avoid this if you have a weak stomach.",1.0

"I was not going to mention it, but since others have done so I will say that I too became sick after having dinner at Cosme. The next day I had it coming nonstop from both ends. That lasted eight days or so.

"Had dinner with a couple of friends this week. Although the service was impeccable, the food was sub par. We all enjoy dining out often, but have never been so disappointed with the quality of a meal. While the market vegetable appetizer was delicious, it was all downhill from there. The squash appetizer had a rancid truffle oil flavor, and the pastas were lackluster. The gnocchi was tough on the outside and rubbery on the inside. The sauce consisted of bits of congealed cheese unevenly coating the gnocchi and the overcooked crunchy mushrooms. The special duck pasta was soggy and the duck ""ragu"" was so ground up that one couldn't tell it was duck. For the main course, the poularde pieces ranged from rubbery to dry, and a $165 40 oz Cote de Boeuf that we shared was gristly and didn't have enough beef flavor for an aged steak. The maple glaze was too sweet and detracted from the taste. The fried potato balls were crispy on the outside, but rubbery on the inside. Also, it was incredibly small for a supposedly 40oz steak. We were only able to get 8 slivers of meat off of it including the fat and gristle. To top it all off, 2 of us got violent food poisoning. The food was vastly overpriced for what we got. Don't go.",1.0
"This was my second time coming to this establishment. 
The first time was in the afternoon at around 2. There was only one other table occupied and we got a table for three (myself, my fiancee, and his business partner). The food was tasty. What really got us was the beautiful decor. It was stunning and I kept commenting on what a gem we stumbled upon. With only that experience I would've probably given the place a five. However, the second time I returned my experience was horrific. 

It was my fiancee's birthday and he wanted an intimate dinner with his close friends. We immediately thought of this place because of the decor and good thai food. We called in advance and asked if they could host a party of 20 people. It is a rather small restaurant but has a large back area. They told us it would not be a problem and we set our reservation for 8:30. 

We arrived at 8:30 and were lead to our table. Immediately I told them there would not be enough room for the party. Our table sat around 10 and with tightly squeezing in we fit in two more. They told us not to worry and put another table close to ours that fit four (but they were still separated). At around 8:45 the rest of the 4 people came. They told us there was no room for them because the restaurant was so packed and sat them on the other side of the restaurant! 

We were furious but decided we had to make the best of the night. We were given one waiter for our entire group. He had no idea how to handle a relatively big crowd. He took are drinks orders at 9:30- an HOUR AFTER WE ARRIVED! He forgot most of the drinks when he came back 15 MINUTES LATER. At that point we were angry that he still had not taken our orders. He told us that he was taking our appetizer orders ONLY. 

At 10:30 he came back with the appetizers. Two people in our party ate the meat and began to feel sick from it. They did not order anything else. I ordered the flank steak which is served hot everywhere else in the world. However, this steak was ice cold. It was completely inedible and blood was still pouring from it. I called over the waiter and asked him politely if he could bring me a different one. I never usually send back food especially when I waited for two hours for it but it was absolutely inedible. I explained to the waiter that it was cold and asked him if it was possible for him to either bring me a new one or heat this one up. His response to me was, ""Well if you wanted something hot you should have ordered the spring rolls."" I explained that I did not want the spring rolls but the flank steak. He told me ""What do you want me to do? The kitchen's back up."" I persisted that I would wait for it if it meant that it would be hot. Finally he told me ""Fine but I'm going to go charge you for your second order."" At that point I lost it. I called the manager over and told him that I refused to pay for a second order of something that I was unable to eat. 

The reason this place is even getting one star is for the decor and that manager (whose name is Charlie I believe). He tried his hardest to alleviate the situation. Quickly took our orders himself and made sure the rest of the food got out to us. At that point it was 11:30. The food was completely mediocre. The best thing was probably their drunken noodles but even that was not flavorful. 

As we were leaving the waiter ran back over to us and handed me a glass of wine ""on the house."" As were were literally walking out I couldn't even drink it.

This place is a travesty. Mediocre food, and horrific service. If you are having a party of over five people you should rethink it. This place just lost 20 customers. 

By the way, Sal is the waiter's name. If you do decide to come here please try to get a different waiter so you don't have to be spoken to rudely. And finally, three people got food poisoning the next day.",1.0
"I only went because of a living social wine tasting deal. Decor and the light sounds of jazz is why Im giving 2 stars.  My waiter Brian was good and very attentive. 

The down side, the food was bland and both me and my bf got sick the same night. The amount of wine and what they offered was cheap. When I saw what the actual cost would've been if not for using my voucher, it was a rip off. Sooooo not worth return here, my stomach can't afford it.",1.0
"Don't order from here! I ordered vegetable Lo mein and bubble tea last night - within minutes of eating had an upset stomach. Suffered with food poisoning the whole night/day. I am so dehydrated now, I had to get IV put in.

"My child and I had food poisoning all night after eating here last night. I've never gotten sick from sushi before -- I have a pretty tough stomach. So this was bad. My daughter didn't even have fish, so it must have been one of the vegetarian rolls (I think the shitake mushroom and cucumber). 

I'll add that he food was delivered inconsistently so that two of our party were without any food for a half hour while everyone else ate. But really, when a restaurant makes you sick, what else matters?",1.0
"Sent back the raw tuna because it tasted terrible. The waiter blamed it on an acquired taste for the way it was prepared. All of us who ate it got sick that night and the next day. Coincidence?

"This review applies to the Pronto Pizza at :
30 West 48th St. between 6th Ave. and 5th Ave. NYC.  They did not have a place to write about them so i went to this site.

Food = five stars. Mosquitos in a restaurant that costs this much and the fact that 2/3 of our party got food poisoning knocks it down to 2 stars.

"I have been to Lady Mendl's many times over the years with my mom and sister, and we always have a great time...until yesterday.

I have a larger selection in my apartment and frankly could make much better, stronger Early Grey tea than what I received here. I always loved their vanilla tea and my sister always got the rose tea--both no longer available. Furthermore, their food service quality and portions have been cut back considerably. The worst part is I believe they now have major issues with food storage and handling because this time we all got sick after eating here. What a disaster, and such a disappointment compared with our prior experiences here. The management really needs to take a hard look at the way they've destroyed a welcoming, hospitable place and turned it into just another opportunity to squeeze every last dime out of customers.

One the empanadas were extremely dry, the meat so dry it was crumbling, the color look grayish and no flavor.  I ordered steak and thankfully the picture in the menu proved to me that it was steak because the taste sure did not.

"Lollipop chicken wings - not very flavorful but the meat was so moist and juicy. 

Steamed roast pork buns - Dough was okay, but there was so much of it! Got bored after one bite. Would not recommend.

For dinner, my friend got Niu beef trifecta with beef broth. She had a few tablespoons and then stopped eating. I thought she was exaggerating until I tried it. It had such a bad after taste, it was inedible. I ordered Heavenly seafood ramen. Not very tasty. I had seen a picture of it and did not realize until after the fact that it had a 'spicy broth'. When I asked the waitress if this soup had the red broth, she nodded. Obviously she didn't hear or understand what I said.

"Went following a food report from Lauren Scala on NBC news who raved about city island and in particular Don Coqui. Big mistake. They must had an excellent angle shots of the restaurant and its food because all we found was what looked like a pretty shabby dining hall (yes, the chairs have white upholstery but most had stains on it).
The hostess was HORRENDOUS. Yes, we arrived without reservations on a Saturday night (6:30 pm) however, the restaurant was half empty and she treated us as if we inconvenienced her. 
The food....mediocre at best.
The salmon caused severe stomach pains and diarrhea for two in our party of four, the skirt steak was two tiny pieces $34 (!), plantain crusted fillet of some fish was dry and flavorless, the Filet Mignon was below average and the sangria left much to be desired. The only dishes that saved the day were the fried Calamari and chicken fried rice.

"I wanted to give the Dallas BBQ some time after it first opened for them to work the kinks out, and for the crowds to die down. It always looked packed with people, and that seemed like a comforting sign. I'd recently moved to NYC for school, and this was both close to the campus, and billed as the 'best BBQ in New York', which was a pretty lofty claim. It failed in every fashion.

My party went on a Thursday night, arriving at about 8 pm. The organization of the front made it difficult to see where the host station was-- there was a desk where people were huddling over, and a big cubicle of takeout food, but the actual hosts were in a dimly-lit recess in the narrow entrance to the actual dining area. The hosts seemed frustrated, and took us over to our table with body language and facial expressions indicating extreme disapproval before we'd even managed to get out anything more than our party size.

We were seated in a half-bench, half chair area, closely sandwiched between other attendees, and I'm not exaggerating when I say mere inches, no place to put purses or coats. There was a whole second floor with glass partitioned railings; that went empty, but I saw the employees lounging around up there and playing with their cell phones, so it seemed they'd rather cram the lower floor than try to disperse their customers more comfortably. The restaurant was well-staffed, but the staff either appeared to be upstairs on break, or right in the entryway fussing over the takeout desk.  We were right by one of the kitchen entrances and the billing station, but we had difficulty getting any service at all.

The table, seating, and floors were gross, and clearly hadn't been bussed. Paper tablemats didn't adequately cover what I'm assuming was the sticky BBQ sauce of the last customer. The music pumping was generic pop, played so miserably loud I couldn't hear anyone else in my party, although they were seated right next to me, and right across from me. We had to shout our orders seven or eight times at our server to be heard; it seemed she spoke adequate English, but we had to repeat ourselves over and over again.

Half the party ordered the steaks, the other half ordered burgers. We also ordered the onion tower, and daiquiris in a variety of flavours. There was a lengthy wait between receiving the drinks and the appetizer, but no less than 30 seconds after the appetizers were set down, they'd arrived with our dinner. 

Drinks had the texture of shaved ice, and were largely too sour. The syrup that they used seemed to be shared across most of it, with a large amount of food colouring hopefully to discourage the sensation of similarity. We all tried each other's on the first complaint and were dismayed. Perhaps the more expensive items on the drink list, or their 'drinks of the month' would have stood out a little more.

The food in general seemed unseasoned: the onion tower was tempura battered and fried, but that was that: no salt, no spices, no special batter, and they'd provided us with table ketchup as the 'sauce'. The steaks were the unappealing grey that you see in CSI morgue scenes. Liquid fat was pooled on the top, and the steak was ringed with semi-cooked fat along the edges. We had ordered rare or medium rare, and it was an even grey tone all the way through, no pink or brown in sight. Hilariously, they'd put little plastic markers in the steaks to indicate the 'doneness' of the steak, but each steak looked identical, all strangely bedded by a soggy tortilla. Once again, unseasoned, un-marinaded, unsalted. We were provided with A1 steak sauce and ketchup. The steaks were topped off with more of the unseasoned tempura-onions, and a heaping helping of soggy steak-cut fries, once again, you guessed, unseasoned.

The burgers didn't fare much better. The bun was sopping, the burger meat was a greasy, fat mush. Although one of our party ordered the special 'Hennessy' burger, she received something drenched in generic BBQ sauce. In terms of toppings, each received a handful of iceberg lettuce leaves, a sad, droopy slice of tomato, and suspicious-looking slices of pickles on the side.

No one ate more than a few bites of each, but despite that, we were short napkins and wipes, totally covered in grease and BBQ sauce from attempting to eat the meal. Gastro-intestinal distress discouraged further consumption, and at least two members of the party (myself included) got serious food poisoning and missed work.

It took more time to flag our server down for the bill than it took to receive the food -- a time bordering from 30 to 45 minutes, in which time we tried to finish our drinks. The bill had a sticker indicating that tip was included, but at the bottom was another suggestion for additional tip on top of that, including the previous tip in the total to tip upon. We did not pay additional tip, and left resolving to never come back.",1.0
"Went here with two friends on Thursday, July 23rd and we each got a burger and all three of us got food poisoning. 

I ordered my burger medium rare, one friend ordered it medium, and the other friend ordered it well done. After the waitress put the order in with the kitchen she came back and said that the chef didn't want to cook my burger medium rare to make sure it was cooked properly. An odd request for an NYC restaurant that is known for its burgers. I said ok fine I'll have it medium. Fast forward to about 5 hours later, I am up all night with horrible food poisoning. I called the next day to let them know what happened, no one picked up, so I left a voicemail asking the manager to call me back on my cell phone at their earliest convenience. It is 2 days later and I still haven't heard back.

The chef was clearly skeptical about the meat being served that night since he/she wouldn't cook my burger medium rare. This meat obviously shouldn't have been served at all given that even my friend who got hers well done got sick.

Also, if a paying customer has reported food poisoning at your restaurant, I'm pretty sure it's in their best interest to follow up at least to gather information about what they ate so that this can be prevented in the future.",1.0
My co-worker and I visited Sunrise Grill on Broad and Beaver yesterday for lunch at around 2:20 pm and we ordered the lunch special Curry Chicken with white rice. Do not be fooled the food may taste good but it will upset your stomach. My co-worker and myself were food poison by the spoiled curry which we found out 3 hours later after indulging. Still till this next morning it is affecting us! Not a good feeling specially when your at work.,1.0
"Went here last night for the first time. $30/pp for the dinner menu. Ended my night puking my brains out with food poisoning. The food poisoning is still recurring. 

I've been to Nori Nori (closed now) and Ichi Umi quite a few times but I've never gotten sick from their food before. I was debating between this place and Minado but I clearly made the wrong choice. Disappointed and angry that we paid almost $90 for this bullcrap. Beware. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go throw up now.",1.0
"Their Pizza sucked!!! It was so nasty, gave me and my friends  food poisoning. The cheese was expired, and it was pricey for one plain pie. It was not FRESH,DELICIOUS or HOT !

"We had dinner at Trois Canards on a Saturday night. The food was only ok. Both my husband and I had fish and we both had the praline soufflee. I also had soup which was SO salty I could not begin to finish my small bowl. I cannot say it was my meal (since my husband had a bite of my fish and the same soufflee) but I was sick for two days with a stomach problem that lasted another few days beyond that! I think the fish was less than fresh though not actually BAD. Almost worse though than the lackluster food, the ladies at the table beside us pulled out a Groupon to pay for dinner. They were refused the discount and the owner came to the table and was very rude in explaining to them that the coupon would NOT be honored. Although it did seem that the ladies had mis-read the fine print, the display of anger from the manager was embarrassing and made me rush through my meal because I wanted to leave. It was so clear that the owner (manager?) had NO interest in making this experience one that might bring these ladies back in spite of their error. So sad. I've lived in Chelsea for years and indeed the original Trois Canards was lovely to both the eye and the palate.",1.0
"I can't believe I'm writing this review because for 2 years I have been a fan of this spot. My boyfriend and ask ordered chicken teriyaki dinner bento box, well.... At least we thought it was chicken? We were served two different looking pieces of chicken and one of them was hard, rubbery and GROSS!! So we passed on that and tried to enjoy the rest of our lovely looking sushi. Next two days We were sick to our stomach & in so much pain, I couldn't even write this review until now.  Sadly I'm not returning, this was the only sushi place I loved in Washington heights.",1.0

Threw up everything.

"I went here Monday (March 30) for dinner around 4:30 PM. I hadn't eaten yet and was famished. I've visited the location in WIlliamsburg and had been a fan. However, after my last visit, I'll never return to either.  

Within an hour of eating my chicken burrito, I began to feel dizzy and nauseous. Within three hours, I was throwing up. Within six hours, I was in the emergency room having convulsions. I was diagnosed with severe food poisoning, spent the night receiving IV fluids and medications, and am spending a third day in bed recuperating.",1.0
"I wish there was a 'zero' star rating, but I guess one star is as low as I can go. Thank you, Haru, for the healthy dose of food poisoning that sent me to the ER for an IV and left me spending New Year's Eve on my couch afraid to be more than 3 feet from my bathroom. Within one hour of eating the Strawberry Fin roll (raw scallops), my stomach began its protest followed by 48 hours of the worst misery and gastrointestinal pain of my life. Once an avid sushi fan, the mere thought of it makes me turn green. Haru used to be a reliable, and delicious place for sushi and in the past  year or so has consistently gone downhill, and is now serving tainted food! Buyer beware. There is always a risk with raw food but eating here is like playing Russian roulette with your health. Stay away....",1.0

"So I went here with a friend and about 2 hours later I began to feel lightheaded and nauseous. I knew immediately I had food poisoning because Ive had it once before. All I did was sleep till around 3am my stomach was burning and I wound up throwing up ALOT. When I contacted my friend the next morning she too said she threw up several times and was on the bowl. This was our first and last time there.

The sauce bar had a trash bin in the center of the sauces (which I didn't notice till we had to pick up the food) and who knows how long those sauces have been sitting there. The place seemed fairly clean but the bathroom also had no more soap, which makes me wonder about how the workers wash their hands? I hope no one that visits this place gets food poisoning, and I hope the other customers that were there don't have to feel what I did. the place was pretty busy.",1.0
"Slow service, below-average food, and high prices make for an overall forgettable dining experience. There are countless excellent diners in New York and The Bridgeview is simply not one of them. I returned recently after several years' hiatus and sadly things were about as mediocre as I remembered them, albeit now with higher prices.

To begin, service was painfully slow. Normally, this does not bother me. However, the simplicity of my party's orders (eggs, French toast, and sandwiches) combined with the fact that the restaurant was nearly vacant during our entire meal is strike 1 for me. Our dishes arrived over an hour after they were ordered.

Second, the quality of the food was invariably poor. And that is ""poor"" by diner standards, which are already significantly lower than my standards for higher end restaurants. It was almost as if each dish had a different thing wrong with it. French toast was cold, hash browns were undercooked, omelettes were flavorless, Reuben sandwiches lacked Russian dressing, etc. Speaking in general, the food did not appear fresh and several members of my party expressed stomach discomfort afterwards. I won't call it food poisoning, because no one vomited, but that's more than enough for strike 2.

Lastly, the entire menu is way overpriced. If a Reuben sandwich is $12, it had better be the best Reuben I have ever tasted and should also include several sides (chips, fries, soup, etc.) Sorry, but a below-average sandwich and stale tasting coleslaw doesn't merit a $12 price tag in my boom. Strike 3, you're out.

Giving it two stars instead of one because the Bridgeview is not ALL bad news. They're open 24 hours, staff is courteous, and they have a cool rendering of the Verrazano Bridge on one of the walls. Unfortunately, it's all downhill after that. After several poor dining experiences here, I will definitely not be returning.",1.0
"I really hate to bash this place, since it's new but I had a really bad experience here. My friends and I came here for a quick bite to eat and the service was so slow. Lots of people have been complaining about the service. We had to wait so long to order, to get an extra bowl or spoon, and then to order dessert, and get our check. Our quick lunch ended up being much longer than we thought. The food came really fast though, which should worry you. 

The menu is very limited, which surprised us all. I'm no ramen expert, but I have eaten my fair share of ramen bowls and this place was sub par. I got the Shitake Mushroom Ramen with a soft boiled egg and char-siu pork. Let me just say the noodles in my bowl were all bunched up together instead of being separate, so there was a big wad of noodles in my bowl. The noodles were a tad overcooked too. Then, the mushrooms were boiled and flavorful, but they were also kind of tough. The pork was just gross, it was all fat and no meat. I don't know about you all, but when I order pork I expect some meat with some fat. This was all pure fat. The egg was cold! The flavor of the broth was pretty good though. Ultimately I didn't finish my bowl, and since we had to wait for our check our bowls of soup were sitting there getting cold. 

Our soups started to form a greasy film or skin on top form the fat, which I thought was just gross. Both me and my friend got sick after eating here. This was not a good experience, and I will not be coming back.",1.0

"I typically don't leave negative reviews, but this place truly merits one.  I came for a friend's birthday.  The food was terrible, but the service was even worse.  We ordered different dishes, but all ended up with the same bland dish.  The wait staff was incredibly rude.  Despite ordering appetizers, entrees, and desserts (some of which did not come, even though we were charged for them), we were rushed out in under an hour, while one girl was still eating.  Despite leaving a 25% tip for horrendous service, one of the guys literally said ""leave"" while we were still dining (they brought the check out with our entrees) and awkwardly stared at our table.  It was an incredibly uncomfortable experience, especially since we weren't lingering (again, we were in and out in under an hour).  During our meal, the waiters constantly bumped into the table, reached across the table to unplug/plug in lights, etc.  Four of the six girls got sick later that night.  When I read a negative review on Yelp, I always give the benefit of the doubt to the restaurant and assume the patrons were drunk, rude, etc., but that simply wasn't the case: this place was truly terrible.",1.0

"My sister in law made reservations for 8 people to celebrate her 31st birthday. Amongst the group, the following foods were ordered: beef burrito, chicken quesadilla, fajitas (shrimp and chicken), a steak dish. From our group EVERYONE got sick and had to call out of work! Food poisoning? Cross contamination? Infected utensils? Unsanitary cooking conditions? Water? The possibilities are endless as to why EVERYONE including my 2 year old son got so sick. The following day, my sister in law had plans for brunch at another location. She did not enjoy one bit of her celebration as she continuously was vomiting. Slowly but surely everyone began getting the runs and vomiting. If I knew this, I would have obviously never given my 2 year old any of that food. The food was bland (thankfully I threw out half of my burrito). My husband did as well. He had to leave early from work and had a 102 fever and extreme abdominal cramping. The ambiance was nice but nothing is worth seeing your family terribly sick. I wonder if management will make any changes to avoid this situation in the future. 

Of course not everyone's experience will hopefully ever be the same. I'll leave it upto your discretion to visit this restaurant.",1.0
"I really wanted to like this place. Having just moved to the neighborhood, the hubby and I wanted to celebrate my new job at a night out in the middle of the week. Unfortunately, after a few hours after the meal the celebration ended abruptly with food poisoning. I reached out to 311 but they closed the case since they say anything could have caused my food poisoning from the morning of or even two days prior to my incident. I will never know but between the pizza and mussels, I must say the mussels were probably the culprit. It was the day before the mussels night special so I could have eaten the older, last batch.",1.0
"Walked in here after the place we were planning on going to had a long wait.  We went for an early dinner (around 6).  After we sat down, a waiter came immediately to ask for our drink order, and we then asked if there were any drink specials going on since there was a sign outside advertising happy hour drinks.  He said he wasn't sure and would go ask.  Next, a bus boy came over maybe a minute or two later and asked for our drinks.  We told him we had asked our waiter about specials and were waiting to hear back.  Finally, the bartender comes over and abrasively tells us ""this bar can make any kind of drink! it's a normal bar! what do you want a cosmo or something?"" I informed him that we were asking if they had any drink deals going on, not about specialty drinks.  We eventually ordered two glasses of wine and two pasta dishes.  The food was underwhelming, definitely nothing special.  We felt very rushed by the waitstaff throughout the entire meal and after while we were drinking our wine.  When the bill came, we saw that they had overcharged us for the wine but just wanted to get out of that restaurant since it was a thousand degrees in there.  The food did not sit well with me or my friend, and ended up making us both sick.  I definitely would not recommend going to this restaurant at all, there are much better places in the area.",1.0
"I had a horrible experience when I was here on May 10th.  My friends and I all ordered lobster rolls.  I knew we were in trouble when it took an hour and a half to get our food. We asked the manager why our food was taking so long and he said, ""Don't worry about it because you guys are going to get your food for free. That's what we do with everyone here.""  We were all in disbelief.  When our food finally reached the table, we noticed that something was  wrong right away.  All of the lobsters rolls were warm, as if they were sitting out for too long.  About 30 minutes after finishing, we all started to feel sick.  I puked several times on my way home and my friends had other ""digestive issues.""  It has been a few days since I ate here and my stomach is still not back to normal.  This restaurant obviously has severe problems with how it operates.

"Where do I begin. Fatburger is absolutely horrible. Avoid this place at all costs. To begin the staff was completely bored and looked lost. The cashier had an attitude and I paid nearly $30 for three burgers and fries. The burgers were nothing special. Void of all taste and me and my girlfriend felt sick after eating them. The only reason we went here was because  a real good burger joint across the street had too many people in it. Fatburger needs to take a lesson from bareburger! bareburger has a great quality product a friendly staff gives you your food quickly and you don't feel nauseous when you leave. Fatburger is clean and spacious. That's the only good thing I could say for it.   I can imagine that is very expensive rent for this establishment. Here's a word of advice to the management and the people who own Fatburger: hire great people
to work your place!! they are representatives of your business!! the staff here are poorly trained probably way underpaid looked bored,  angry , confused, did not know the prices, took forever to give us our meal.  I live in the neighborhood and I will never ever come back here again. I imagine that this place will be closing within the next year. It's a shame because you can tell they put a lot of money into this place but in the end of the day when you have a horrible staff giving you a terrible experience even if the burgers were good which they are not you're going to lose. Never ever ever ever again. I'm so pissed !!!",1.0

"The brunch at The Strand is tasty, not delicious but very good. However, the service is really really really really really slowwwww. Don't have brunch here if you have any plans to make on time afterwards.

The staff also doesn't listen very well. I asked for a bloody mary and they brought me a bloody ""something"" with bourbon. Then when the waitress came to take it away she asked if I wanted a bloody mary instead. Um...that's what I ordered in the first place!!

They also came and asked to clear my plate when it was half full but left my friend's plate which was completely empty. 

Overall - yummy brunch & sucky f**king service.

Good bar crowd and apparently great happy hour deals (e.g., $6 for a martini)  Appetizers included several charcuterie plates which consisted of a rather miserly assortment of sliced sausage, cheese,  pickles, etc.  Most entrees in the $25-$30 range.  Colleague sitting across from me and I both ordered the duck confit at $24.  Bad mistake.   While we both got sick, I had a particularly bad night throwing up for hours.  Got at best 4 hours sleep before the 3rd 10 hour meeting today.  I feel like I've been run over.  Can't believe I gave 2 stars rather than 1 but assume it was an honest mistake not careless disregard for hygienic factors.  Speaking of which, the restroom was grotesque...really an egregious example of unisex bathrooms gone wrong.  The drunk moron who came out when I went in left the seat up and failed to flush the toilet.

"My friend and I have just had one of the WORST dining experiences ever in New York and I'm not sure if there is a way to report food poisoning in New York but if there is please let me know.

Yesterday my friend and I ate here for lunch. It was a busy day so it was our only meal of the day and as we wanted to try out the grilled chicken salad and the salmon starter we ordered one of each and shared our meal, both eating from the same plates. Within 30 minutes we starters feeling really really sick so we started heading home.

We didn't make it home. My friend started first, at Delaney station she was violently ill on the j platform. We got on the subway but had get off after a few stops as I now stared to feel ill. We were both violently sick outside, so I'll we decided to head to our nearest ER as by now we were not puking food anymore. 

We called the restaurant back to inform them of what had happened. They took our details and said they would call us back. An hour later we were called back by a rude manager who didn't ask of our condition but asked us where we were and then said she would call us back. That's was over 24hrs ago. Since then we have not been called back or written to. 

Please please please whatever you do do not order any salmon or fresh salad from this place. You will come down with the worst food poisoning ever, they will charge you almost $80 for it and they won't care when you're sick or try to rectify the situation. If there is an avenue we can peruse with the nyc department of health we will as I'm sure there are other people who have been poisoned at this establishment.

"Took my GF here for Sunday brunch. 

1) This happened to be a very cold day and it seems as though the restaurant neglected to turn on the heat because everyone in the restaurant (including us) were wearing their jackets. Way to create a comfortable enviornment.

I am all for employees helping out but this is Sunday brunch, they should have a designated bartender. And this explains why the service was really poor (had to ask twice for bread and hail people over to get a drink and a check)

3) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY we got FOOD POISONING. Now I know that the source of food posioning is very hard to prove however using deducution that myself and my GF only ate or drank together at this particualr restaurant within a 24 hour period prior to and didnt eat afterwards I can almost certainly say this place got us HORRIBLY SICK.

 Food was so hard as well. I ll recommend everyone who like Asian Indian Pakistani food don't go to that place. Let me talk with manager owner and I ok get back with another review.",1.0
"Nope, don't do it!

Brought a large group here for my birthday and was very sorry I did. Came here on the recommendation of a friend who has since lost his privilege to recommend restaurants.  

Food was ok - but several people from my group reported being very sick after eating there.  Weak.

Service? Unfriendly, rude, arrogant.  I could go on for days.

2 stars because the bathroom was really clean or this would be a one star wonder.",1.0
"I wish I can give this place zero stars. Avoid this place at all cost!!!!! 

My mother in law was hospitalized for food poisoning. Due to the ""fresh clams"" she was perspiring with sweat and vomiting for two days straight. 

So please, don't come here and eat their food,
especially the raw clams as they are not fresh and can give you serious runs...

I've been here numerous times and this will definitely be the last time coming here. With the prices going up, the quality of food has been disappointing time after time. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the hospital bills!!!",1.0
"Went here for a date with my girlfriend...really, a bad experience. For starters, the place was empty; not a soul in here besides the server, the cooks & manager, and the delivery guys working on a motorized scooter right outside the front of the restaurant. Really? Anyway, we ignored that red flag and went in. The waitress claimed to be unaware of any deal with Yelp (they had a deal which awarded two guests a free glass of wine each for checking in at the restaurant,) so she called the manager over. He told us that they ""never set up any deal with Yelp"" and would not honor it. After a bit of back and forth, he agreed to give us ONE glass of wine. Fine...so we ordered. The portions were a joke, and on top of it, the food was absolutely disgusting. My girlfriend's pasta carbonara tasted like a spaghetti omelet. WAY too eggy to be considered a respectable Italian dish...or a respectable dish period. We could smell the eggs coming off the meal, that's how gross it was. She didn't eat it and I ordered raviolis; not terrible but nothing exceptional. Anyway, we paid and left and once we got home (about a half hour later) both had to hit the toilet immediately and spent a good amount of time on it the rest of the night. Could have just been us not reacting well to the amount of milk/eggs in their sauces but we never get sick when we eat Italian; ever. Beware, or just stick with ordering pizza.",1.0
"What has happened to HARU, It used to be a NYC staple of great fresh sushi , service is overly disappointing. Overpriced much! to top it off I got food poisoning couple days ago!! I was sick for 2 days ,, it was my only meal that day!! NEVER AGAIN",1.0
Absolutely horrible food. Both my girlfriend and I got sick after eating here one day. Terrible place. I haven't gone back since and I will never go back. Stay away at all costs!!,1.0
"A quick summary - awful, all the way around.  The food was bad, the service was worse, and the bill was ridiculous.  The subsequent food poisoning however, was the topping on the sundae.

The tragedy here isn't that we wasted a meal at MP Taverna.  It's that Astoria is literally full of excellent Greek restaurants - you can't throw a rock from this location and not hit one (in just about every direction).  That's what makes our experience that much worse.

This was a systemic failure across the board.  The service was terrible - from being hastily shown to our table in this nearly empty restaurant while being scolded about their policy for ordering (we asked to order appetizers first, and got 'we order everything at once here, although they'll come out in order').  There was literally zero flexibility; when asked for grated cheese, our server retorted 'you don't need grated cheese for that meal'.  

The food itself wasn't all bad.  Hit or miss certainly covers it - the octopus appetizer was quite good, the other appetizers were average at best (again, find me a Greek restaurant that can't do the same or better and I'll be surprised).  Everything was overpriced and downsized in portion.

The food went from average to worse when the main courses arrived.  Souvlaki is something that you can get just about everywhere in Greece, and everywhere in Astoria.  Hell, you can get a decent meat kabob just about everywhere in NYC, albeit not spiced the same way and not always the same meat.  How a restaurant like this managed to botch the most simple of Greek dishes is beyond me.  Dry, underspiced meat, again in small portion (despite pork shoulder being the cheapest thing you'll ever buy at a butcher).  This wasn't the worst part though.

My son opted for the lamb with orzo.  This wasn't just disappointing - it made him severely ill at night, causing him to vomit several times and miss school the next day.  I blame myself - the food arrived at the table, and it was lukewarm (the trademark of a meal that's been reheated - and rule #1 for food borne illness, make sure you heat those leftovers well past 170F).  It tasted dry, as if it had been pulled from a pan where it had been prepared the day before.  Already annoyed with the level of service we received, and thinking that the temperature was due to sitting around before being delivered to our table, I didn't send it back.  I wish I had, because the poor guy spent the next three days unable to eat.  Two other members of our party would also suffer with stomach aches and pains the next day.

Not knowing he was sick just yet, the experience hadn't quite taken the turn for the worse, until the last part.  We were there for a birthday, and had arrived with a cake.  Upon seating, nobody had mentioned that the cake would incur a plating fee.  When dinner was done, after running up a $400 tab and not having had any alcohol (and several dishes that would run you no more than $10 elsewhere), the waitress came out and asked if we wanted coffee or cappuccino.  We started to compile our order, at which point we reminded her about our cake.  She insisted on continuing to take the drink orders, trying to slip them in while mentioning as she walked away 'oh, there's probably a plating fee for your cake'.  I stopped her, asked her to check in and see what it might be.  She continued 'ok, should I put the coffee order in first?"".  Sure enough, they wanted $3 per person to cut the cake.  That put the brakes on dinner, and lost them a good $35 of profit on the coffee/cappuccinos they were about to serve us.

Nothing but regrets here - the service was bad, the food was worse, and not everyone made it through the night intact.  First time in years that I've tipped below 20%, and I regret wholeheartedly leaving her 15% because it wasn't just bad service, it was rude.  I implore you - if you are looking for an upscale Greek restaurant, take the ride into Manhattan, where there are a handful of restaurants ready to provide you fantastic, *fresh* Greek food in an upscale setting.  If you're looking for Greek in Astoria, the surrounding 5 blocks have at least 3 if not more restaurants that'll do the trick.

If you need to lose weight in a hurry or need to be gouged, this is the restaurant for you.  Don't fall for hype, go for substance, something this restaurant was short on.",1.0
I did not have a good experience here. The atmosphere was ok. The tvs were all blasting. And the worst was that i got violently  ill after eating here and so did my husband. All we had was buffalo wings medium and we walked out and were sick for days.. We got food poisoning! I will never go there again. Very disappointing! Eat here at your own risk!!,1.0
"My mother-in-law, husband and I all got food poisoning from here. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza on Sunday, March 15, 2015 and were all sick that night and the next day. It was a miserable 12 hours. I guess the pro is that I lost 4 pounds from vomiting!",1.0
"Let me start off by saying save yourself the time, frustration, disappointment, and money by AVOIDing THIS PLACE altogether!

I rarely hate a bar, and rarely give a place a single measly star. 

My girlfriend and I were roaming the streets of NYC in search of a drink and a bite to eat. Just wanted something to hold us over until dinner and didn't want to spend too much money. So we stopped into Bravest when we saw the menu. 

They had a decent draft list and an Ok menu so we ordered the Ground Pork Sliders and Turkey Arugula Wrap. 

The waitress was super nice. She took the order and that was that. 40 minutes later we still had no food. Now let me tell you we stopped into this place at 3 pm on a friday. There were a total of 4 other customers in the entire bar. So this should have been a 15 min wait max. There were 2 bartenders and 3 cooks in the kitchen. 

When we asked where our food was she said she had mistakenly put the order in the POS system but the printer was offline. Hence our food was never made. Finally, after 45 mon our food came out and it was gross. The sliders were 3 measly little burgers on a plate. No garnish. Nothing. They were supposed to be spicy ground pork sliders. They were frozen mini patties with some crappy sauce on them. Disgusting. 

The wrap was whatever. I could have made a better wrap in 5 min using the random things found in my kitchen. Overall the food was heinous. Me and my girlfriend both felt sick after eating it. 

To top the whole thing off, right after we got our food, one of the guys standing at the bar asked the bartender where his food was. It had been 30 min since he ordered so he asked for it to go since he had to leave in 5 min. The bartender/waitress said she would check on it. She came back a minute later and said it was going to take more than 5 min to finish the ordered. One order for one person was going to take over 35 min in an empty bar?!?!?! Absurd. He cancelled the order and walked out. 

Overall this is one of the worst bar experiences I have ever had! Period! This place should be demolished with a tractor. Its too bad too because the theme of the bar is really cool. But the food and service is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life!

Stay far from this place!",1.0

We picked at the entrees and took the whole thing home. Didn't know if we were getting a virus or if it was the food. We never mentioned it to my son who ate the spaghetti and the orrichiette the next  evening and HE complained of feeling sick all night after eating the food.

"Don't understand the allure of a place it was packed full of hipsters obsessively checking their phone for the latest Coachella update on snapchat just trying to avoid feeling the FOMO. The worst part was that both me and my friend both felt sick after eating the bblt sandwich and it ruined the rest of our afternoon. The service was really poor and the whole process took about 2 hours.  Seems like one of those places people go just so they can check in on swarm and let their friends know they went. Might have hit a bad day, server, or dish but the atmosphere is the overwhelming part of the experience regardless. More bark than bite in my opinion.",1.0

"DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH: Food Poisioning Warning

I ordered lunch from here on seamless for a burger cooked medium and a side of onion rings. The order took 2 1/2 hours to be delivered when they had quoted a 45 minute wait time.  When I called, the woman on the phone said she was remaking my food because it was now cold and they could not get someone to deliver it. I don't live far from here so I'm not sure what the hold up was. Meanwhile that was the only thing I ate on Saturday and it's now Monday and I'm eating for the first time because I got horrible food poisoning from the food and I was in the hospital for two days.

"I don't know why the great reviews for this place.  Everything is overly oily. The only tasty part of our meal are the complimentary breads, which were unfortunately soaked in olive oil as well.
I had the octopus appetizer and the scallop entree.  Both seafood dish were not fresh tasting.  There were some fishy smell and made me have violent diarrhea right after the meal.  The scallop were $28 for 4 pieces.  The califlowers were so burnt, they were bitter and uneatable.  The octopus appetizer was soaked in oil or butter and overly salty.
We were there on a weekday, and there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.  She was definitely overworked and forgot my drink order.  We still gave her a 20%tip since it wasn't her fault the meal tasted bad.
Won't return again.",1.0
"I've been living in Flatbush my whole life and I've never seen this place packed at all. 

Pretty much every holiday my family have a gathering at my house and we cool tons of food. After hearing great reviews from friends and family about this place my mom would buy roti from here to cut something off her list of things to do. On multiple occasions my family members who ate roti would go home saying they had diarrhea.

On another occasion. I came home late from work and wanted something to eat and they were the only place open. I get a couple of patties and head home. As I bite into one of them I notice a huge dead fly inside my patty. I went to talk to a manager and they said no one was there and they can only refund me whatever I brought back to them and not the complete purchase amount. 

Since then I've never been back and have taken my business elsewhere.",1.0
"I got food poisoning and got really sick from here. Threw up three times a day later. My brother ate there with me, also started throwing up at the same exact time.... Other than that the food wasn't so bad. Extremely small portions and takes a long time for the food to come out.",1.0
"This restaurant could be so very good. Unfortunately its kitchen execution is pretty sub par. In fact, both my companion and I fell ill late last night and this morning. Believe it or not, my review on this place is not because we got sick. It's because the cooking is not good.

The menu reads really well, lots of appealing dishes, almost a continental chophouse style of sorts. Unfortunately, whoever was in the kitchen last night was phoning it in and not tasting or paying attention. An inedible acidic dressing on the pea greens and haloumi, an awfully dry octopus that was a joke at $15, and a tough, under-seasoned hangar steak left us more than disappointed. 

The style of restaurant is great, and as stated, the menu is inviting. But the place for what ended up at $100 a head left us feeling really annoyed and ripped off.",1.0
"Went here before seeing the Jimmy Fallon show when Pearl Jam played.  Ordered drinks at the bar.  They were delicious and promptly made, although both did not have the garnishes they were supposed to come with.  Vanilla vodka martini was supposed to have a vanilla bean (did not) and old fashion was supposed to have a cherry and an orange (no orange).  We ordered the crab dip which was...weird. Luke warm and fell apart, like crumbles.  Later that night I was violently ill and my husband was later in the morning.  Obviously we have no proof it was the crab, but others were eating the other things we ate that night with us and we were the only two that got sick, so....",1.0

"Don't ever eat here. Do yourself that favor. 

I was extraordinarily hesitant to go here because of all the horrendous reviews it has, but it was a friend's birthday so I sucked it up. We ordered some wings, buffalo chicken strips, fried pickles, fries and tots between 7 people to share. Nothing was good. Dry flavorless chicken, cold fries...just awful.

A few short hours later and I was feeling incredibly sick. I found out that all the other people I went with also got sick later that night too. Unless you want a serious stomach ache after this food, avoid this location at all costs. 

This was my first and absolute last visit to Hooters ever.",1.0
"So it has come to my attention that there is something wrong with the food here. Today was the second time that I ended up throwing up and feeling super sick after eating here. I'm going to rant a lot about this place, so be ready to read!! 

First of all, our group made a reservation for 7:30 pm, but when we got there, they did not have any records of our reservation. We ended up waiting for about 20 mins for them to clear up tables and we were a large group so we had to sit in two separate tables. If you aren't going to honor your reservation, you shouldn't  put that option there. -____-

The first time that this occurred was during the summer before I left for my trip to Asia. I ate the clam cream rice. I shared the rice with my friend because we both weren't that hungry and we just went here to catch up before I left. I ate some of the rice, but half way, my appetite was just gone. After I got home, I felt really sick and started throwing up. 

Today, I had dinner with some of my friends. I ordered the burger that comes with fries. I only ate like 3/4th of the burger and took out the bottom bun because it was WAY WAY WAY too greasy that my bun was soaked in oil and became soggy. I ate like 3 fries and didn't even finish it. At first, my friends and I were excited to get the green tea molten lava cake because I had it before and it was pretty good, but we all lost our appetite after a while and actually forgot about dessert. Two of my friends got the omurice; one with beef and the other with beef curry (they both barely touched their dish). 

When I got home, I felt extremely sick like I wanted to throw up. After a while, i threw up some of the burger and felt a bit better. My friend that also ate at the same place felt sick as well and threw up some stomach acid. 

Not only was the food bad, but their service was pretty bad as well. Someone ordered soda and never got it, but they charged us for it on the bill (ended it taking it off because we told them), we had to ask three times for them to refill our water. We were a pretty large group, so after we payed, two of the workers stood at the opening (since we were sitting in the back) and kept glaring at us. I don't understand why they wanted us to leave so badly because it was obvious no more customers were coming in. 

Overall, the food here is ehhhhh and really greasy, they have a C rating, so I guess that's why I kept feeling sick, and their service is pretty bad. Never coming back here. P.S. I'm really hungry right now after throwing up.",1.0
"I have eaten here for years and always loved it.  A few days back I ordered a large pie with 2 toppings and got really sick from it.  I hadn't eaten anything else that day so I'm sure it was something in that pizza that made me sick.  I threw up for 24 hours.  If it was just me that got sick, I would say that I must have caught bacteria someplace else and it's a coincidence that I got sick the same time I ate their pizza... However, the other TWO people that shared the pizza with me ALSO got sick a BOTH threw up as well.  So we are positive that it was their pizza.  I will never eat here again.  And I hope nobody else that does eat here gets sick from their food.",1.0

"Initially I was really looking forward to having a nice Italian spot right around the corner, but two very below average visits and I'm not willing to throw good money after bad. The first visit was fine as far as service, but it was an early dinner with nearly no other tables occupied, so it couldn't have been much of a challenge. The food was delicious, but a colleague and I both got sick after our meal, so I was very wary to try All'onda again. I thought at least restaurant week would be an affordable second chance. Mistake. The red wine (which we had to wait 10 min to order) was cold, or as they say ""at cellar temperature."" With a red wine list as comprehensive as All'onda's it baffled me that they had no appropriately warm red wine options. The food menu is ridiculously cryptic, which would have been less of an issue had our waitress been attentive enough to explain it to us. She wasn't. After ordering mysterious dishes, the food portions were tiny. Very tasty, but tiny. On top of it all we were seated in a corner table along an open brick wall and were shivering the entire meal. Horrible experience and will certainly never be visiting All'onda again or recommending it to any colleagues/friends.",1.0

I ordered the volcano roll and the superman roll along with a side of spicy mayo. I ate both and I felt sick after, but not enough to throw up. Both rolls were not tasty AT ALL.

"So i have been to this location a few times and have a very mixed review. 

I have had 2 gentleman bartenders at this place ( both are awesome and super friendly.) I am upset i forget their names but one of them is french. Thank God he came to finish taking care of me and my friend because the female bartender we had knew nothing about the menu whatsoever.. Maybe she was new. 

Anyway, i LOVE their Caprese salad. The Mozzarella is super fresh and very creamy. I also enjoy their toast which has mushrooms and cheese on it.

The problem was.. Me and my friend got sick from the lamb shank they served us that night. I have never ordered lamb shank before but it was recommended by one of the servers. It tasted pretty good while we were eating it, however the day after me and my co worker both had stomach aches and felt nauseous. 

I feel bad to write a review negative like this, however i think that Bocca Di Bacco is a mixed bag, and needs to maybe up the quality of their entrees. Apps are good and wine selection is great.

But I would deff recommend going for apps and drinks, lots of other places that have better entree selection.",1.0
"Went here for lunch with my boyfriend on Saturday afternoon, a sweltering July day. It was only slightly less cool inside - NOT a good sign for a sushi place, frankly. (If you're dealing with raw fish, it shouldn't be 85 degrees inside your restaurant)

The service and food were OK I guess, they sat us at the bar because there was no room and they overcharged me for my duck salad by a dollar, but I didn't make a thing of it.

The real problem is that both my boyfriend and I have had BAD gastrointestinal distress since Saturday night.

I went here with a big brunch crew and we were all pumped to try this place. First, we were shocked by the prices. Second, we were shocked by the low quality of the food. The cocktails were tiny and weak for $14.

Much more than your average brunch spot. They were also playing really intense rap which is nice/ fun for like the night before but we were all hung over and there's Wacka Flocka blasting to the beat of gun shots. ROUGH.

The only thing tolerable on the menu was the guac, which was actually quite nice and unique as quac goes. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which were a saucy bomb of beans, eggs and chips (gross), a friend of mine got Chilaquiles, which was really just a mountain of chips, another friend got the quesdilla, which was as big as her arm and just slathered in sour cream with no other flavor.

How is it even possible to mess that up?  The bun was soggy.  We ordered the asiago fries and they brought out regular.  They were too greasy.  My chicken came out pink and salad didn't have fresh lettuce. The mac and cheese bites had no bacon in them, which it said they would on the menu.  Not only was our server incompetent, but she was extremely rude, and unfriendly.  She was also so arrogant.  I believe her name was Brittany.  They also were out of 2 of the beers that my friend tried to order.  Féile really needs to get their you-know-what together or go out of business.  I'll be shocked if they're still there in a year.

I've been here three times and every time I ended up on the roof. It's a nice outdoor, and there's a convertible awning in the event of rain. There's no spectacular view, but it's still a nice spot. 

Go for happy hour, but don't pay full price. The frozen margaritas make for a thrifty, yummy, and potent happy hour cocktail. They have a few good beers on tap. Again, good for happy hour. If you're going to pay full price for a drink you can do it at other bars in the area with better selection.

On the flip, the food is dangerous. My husband and I both got food poisoning. Badly. Ruined our weekend. Yes, food poisoning is often a fluke, but I wouldn't risk it. Plus the food, the breakfast nachos, wasn't all that good. There was no bacon as promised. No bacon = no good. Food poisoning = worse.

The service is decent, but kind of spotty. The bartender of visit one was very friendly. The bartendress of visit two was a bit of a sour puss. The food runner of visit three was super cool, but the waitress was a total jerk.

Go for happy hour.
Never for food.
Don't expect great service.
Do expect reasonable margaritas that do the trick.",1.0
"This is my first yelp review, and I just left the restaurant...that's how bad this experience was. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I am. My girlfriend and I are both New Yorkers and enjoy eating out a little too much. She planned a few dates during restaurant week to try some places we have yet to go. Places to try out that maybe we'd come back to - Butter was one of those places, and we will never return. 

Not only did we wait to be seated for 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation, the food and service was amateur. Try having clam chowder soup and raviolis served cold. 

In addition, our waiter treated us like some bimbos off the street with no money to spend. Why? Because we were eating at a discounted price for restaurant week? You mean an event that thousands of New Yorkers partake in as a fun 2-3 weeks? Right.

Were we seriously not worthy of the same service that we saw him giving the surrounding tables, who just so happened to not be partaking in restaurant week?

Not ONCE did he even ask how our food was. No conversation at all regardless of the attempts we made..not only was this extremely awkward but down right rude. There are so many other nice restaurants in this city I rather spend my money at. Take it someone who is born and raised here.

This place is not worth it. Don't even bother. Beyond awful and worth the one star.

UPDATE: My girlfriend woke up in the middle or the night and got sick. This has continued for most of the night and into this morning.",1.0
"My group and I wanted to try some good ol' New York pizza and we also wanted some as our 4th meal lol. So we Yelped for a pizza place that was near and one that was open at 12:30 in the morning, Daro's was the first one to come up! 

We ordered 2 pepperoni pizzas which came out to be $38 plus tip (pricey for 2 pizzas). It was late so we waited by the window for the delivery guy to come so he didn't have to ring the doorbell, but turns out that they deliver by bike! Whaaaattttt!!??? That was the first time I ever saw that in person, the only time I ever saw that was probably in a movie haha.

When we opened the box we can see why the pizza was $38 = it was huge! The pizza was not too greasy or cheesy, it was a thin crust which I really like but overall it was an alright pizza. The next morning though, my boyfriend and his sister felt sick after eating it. All of us wanted to see what the hype was about with New York pizzas and when we finally did try it, it wasn't all that great :/",1.0
"After eating here, we had pretty bad food poisoning. Not sure what caused it, specifically, but since the rest of our group was fine, it was probably the thai iced tea or chicken. Don't get the pineapple fried rice, it's made with weird gloopy ketchup.",1.0
"HORRIBLE! - Food Poisoning!
Went this weekend for my friends birthday, the minute we got there the hostess was giving us a hard time about getting a table for the 10 of us, even though the place was completely empty. Our waiter was not helpful, we kept having to track him down to order things. He even forgot to put in someones order, so when everyones food came out she got her plate 30 minutes later. The food had a nice presentation and seemed good, until later that night me and 4 other people got extremely sick, only to find out we had food poisoning - (and we're still sick!)
Everything is overpriced, and they will charge you for everything and anything! Then when the bill came and we questioned the waiter what some of the charges were, he got very defensive and angry. We paid the bill, including the 20% gratuity that was automatically included, even though our waiter was so terrible he did not deserve the $50 tip. While we were leaving we told the waiter we were disappointed, and, instead of apologizing, our waiter shook his head and made a VERY rude remark about him having more money than us.

Hopefully the manager sees this and takes action in teaching the staff how to be polite, helpful, and worthy of earning the 20% gratuity. Also going to file a food safety complaint because the 4 of us that ate dinner there are still sick with food poisoning - I even had to go to the doctors today!

Never going there again.",1.0
"Ok, this is not good. I checked out Yelp reviews to see if anyone had as negative an experience here as I did, and sure enough, a few others have complained of food poisoning/feeling sick. I wanted to believe it was just me, but having to run to the bathroom several times in the middle of the night with really bad stomach pain and the thing that Pepto Bismol is made for (ladies, it was much worse than the pain of really bad period cramps) after recently having dinner here made me think otherwise. Add to that the fact that my friend also felt sick the same night after we had dinner here. I can eat a piece of shit meal at McDonalds and not feel this way. I know it was just the food at Calexico because I hadn't eaten since lunch and felt like shit after having dinner here. Fucking awesome crack sauce, right? Not when your toilet becomes your best friend at 1 am. I am thinking that maybe some of the meat and fish here is undercooked or something, or the produce isn't washed properly, because for other people to complain of feeling sick after eating here AND for my friend to feel the same the same night...it's not just a bunch of people ranting. I won't be returning back because I don't want to risk having the same experience again.",1.0
"If I could  give a zero I would.
I have been waiting for this place to get an A rating because I heard they have a good marg deal. The service was slow and they weren't even busy- I've worked as a waitress so I am always super patient but it was really bad.

The service is terrible...the waitress push you to eat fast and get the hell out of here. I wonder how they get 4 stars...Me and my friends give this restaurant below zero star. I would recommend Rendang Malaysian Restaurant or Nyonya Malaysian Restaurant. Me and my friends will not go back again.",1.0
"I am convinced these guys are coasting on reputation and tourists reading these reviews and going to them. As evidence for the tourist claim, the guy in front of me in line had to ask what falafel is. I've never heard a more flyover country question in my life.

I love me some gyro and falafel, and I'd read the reviews of these guys, so when I saw them after leaving MOMA I decided to grab some falafel.

The line, as expected, was very long. I thought ""oh yeah, they're popular, this is a good sign."" There were three guys manning the stand, the most I've ever seen in one cart before. After five minutes of standing in line in the cold and not moving my girlfriend went up to see what was going on. One guy was making food (very slowly), two guys were just standing there doing nothing (it turns out one of them takes the money, idk what the third guy is for). They were seriously the slowest food cart I've ever seen.

I finally got my falafel, and it was just really sub par. It was cold, which, I mean, how fucking hard is it to keep some falafel warm? It was hard, greasy, and sour. I've never had sour falafel before. I don't know how you can even make it like that.
The one upside is it was cheap, but so is every other gyro-and-falafel cart in the city.

So, yeah, completely over rated, terrible, will never go back. Bad food, slow service, pretty sure they're just a tourist trap.

Edit: Update: It is now the day after we ate there, and my girlfriend has food poisoning. Hardcore diarrhea, all that fun stuff. Now, we also ate at a tex mex place yesterday, and it might be that, or something else entirely, but yeah. Not a good sign.",1.0
The lunch buffet gave us a terrible diarrhea! Don't go there for the lunch buffet!,1.0
"I was less than impressed with Trattoria Trecolori.  I came here last Wednesday for a business lunch, there were about 14 of us, and the waitstaff was incredibly rude.  They seemed like they didn't want us to be there and regardless of whether or not that's true, I would think they'd be on their 'A' game since everyone knows company lunches, dinners, etc. ALWAYS end up costing a lot of money.  We ordered almost 6 appetizers, plenty of salads to share, and everyone ordered their own main meals.  

Because there were so many of us, we asked for pitchers of water for the table so that we could refill our glasses as needed and the server replied ""we'll come around and refill your glasses.""  That never happened, not once.  

Additionally, one of my co-workers ordered steak and when he wasn't happy with the way it was cooked the manager came over to him and advised him ""he ordered wrong.""  As an ex waitress of 5 years I totally understand that customers can get annoying and sometimes don't know what they're talking about, but I also know the golden rule in the service industry which is: ""The customer is always right.""  Clearly this rule does not exist in this establishment.

I ordered the chicken parm with pasta and it tasted okay, nothing amazing.  My 2 co-workers who ordered veal dishes both got sick right after the lunch and remained ill for the rest of the day.  Scared that I could end up with a stomach ache as well I threw out my leftovers, even though I didn't experience any of the symptoms they did.  

We sat in the upstairs section of the restaurant so I don't know if we would have had a more enjoyable experience if we sat somewhere else, but unless I'm going to a prepaid company lunch here I will not be returning.",1.0
I ate here the other day. The pizza got me sick to my stomach. I vomited and had diahera for a day. My boyfriend had the same slice and also got sick. the place is dirty and cold. They should close this place down. They had a C rating and somehow raised it to an A. Its time for a new inspection. Also they touch the pizza with their hands..no gloves...good luck if you dare eat there!! I am calling the health department.,1.0
"Alright so it seems I must give up one of my favorite places now.  Something is definitely wrong with their cleanliness because I had terrible stomach issues (piles to be exact) and I felt it almost halfway through eating.  I have a stomach of steel, so when I brought some friends here they all complained of stomach problems, I thought maybe they were just sensitive.  Nope - definitely diarrhea.

Also...why does 6 slices of lamb (of not so great quality) cost $7.75?  Not worth it.  And the beer tastes a bit odd - they have not cleaned the tap properly.  If I were to ever come back here again, they'll really need to clean everything top to bottom and raise the temperature on their food coolers.",1.0

"Will never eat here again! Have eaten here on three occasions. Food is horrible. First time I came here with my boyfriend we ordered breakfast. After a long walk we found this place. I ordered two eggs scrambled with fries. My eggs came back runny. I complained. After I said I wasnt eating it they proceeded to take it back and give me a new order. Came back with the same eggs. Needless to say I got sick. Boyfriend insisted on it since he worked late. Gave it another shot. This time I ordered the Belgian Waffle. They got it right. So I went back a third time. I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes. My boyfriend had the misfortune of ordering the lumberjack platter. Meatloaf was overcooked, salty. My boyfriend asks for extra bacon instead of sausage or ham. Not only do they mess up his order, (no bacon, just sausages) the eggs were runny. We both left immediately. Paid the check. Each of us had an upset stomach for a few days. That was the last time we ate there. And we ate at this diner recently. Not worth it. Id rather go to Coral's. In the same neighborhood.

I ordered the cuban sandwitch again and my husband ordered the roasted pork or something. We enjoyed the food, but this time both me and my husband had food poison the next morning.

What can I say...it was quite mediocre. We both took one bite and I could tell we were forcing ourselves to eat the rest. The cakes were soggy and spongy, the creme made my insides feel like it became coated with oil. The seating is crammed and it's truthfully not worth the pain or the stomach ache afterwards (we both got sick from the cakes), pretty much this place runs on the business of tourists who do not know any better. 

The waitress came with our check after waiting another 10 minutes and the three items we ordered came out to $30 (they automatically include a fee if you choose to sit inside..which is also illegal) totally not worth it, especially since the ambience is no better than a Burger King. If I could give zero stars, I would.",1.0
To management and LongHorn corporation. Kitchen and bar area need to be inspected. We dined here on Friday night and I am sure that the terrible experience came from Longhorn because we had our previous meals home cook. We both end up suffering all night vomiting and having diarrhea. We should have taken the warning seriously because the bar area had a strange smell. It smelled like something had been rotten somewhere around that area as soon as we entered. I do not think I will return to this longhorn. I hate to give 1 star but the experience is beyond lesson learned.,1.0
"We stopped in here on a walk around the city because the place looked interesting.  Upon stepping inside the smell of bar cleaner was overwhelming.  I had to ask the bartender to open the door for fresh air.  I should have walked out before we ordered.  We had some beer and chicken.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken thighs.  My friend asked the waiter if it was cooked properly.  It was the fattiest most disgusting food I've ever had.  We were both very hungry and ate what was in front of us.  
Words can not describe how sick I was.  My friend forced himself to vomit.  I don't have that ability and suffered for the whole time the poison passed through my system.  They should be closed down.  No NYC food establishment should save money at the cost of the customer.  This was the worst meal I've ever had.  I'm serious the worst I've ever had in my life.",1.0

"Have eaten here a few times before.  The food is usually just okay but most of my other favorite burrito joints have since closed down...  Thus is life in brooklyn where everything good closes.

Anyway, I went last night and seriously got a terrible case of food poisoning.  I don't know how this happened- I got a black bean burrito.  It's rice, beans, cheese, and guacamole (how do you fuck this up??) and I woke up in the middle of the night violently ill, and so did my fiancé who ate with me.  Not sure how the third person with us faired.  Did someone handling my food directly take a shit in my burrito?  Was one of the FOUR ingredients spoiled? It's not like I got some weird meat in my food.  Pretty sure it's hard to contaminate a bean burrito.  WAY TO GO.

Edit for Dave:

Hi Dave,
Unfortunately reviews of customers getting sick aren't as rare as claimed- all you have to do is sort through the 1 star reviews as well as the non-recommended reviews and you will find at least 7 or 8.  Sorry I was a little bit sassy in my review, but I was thoroughly frustrated waking up in the middle of the night sick, and feeling sick for the next twelve hours- as well as other who ate with me.  Seeing this is the only common factor in days and the time line of us getting sick was the same, I'm going to go ahead and yes, pin point the restaurant.  Thank you for your concern.",1.0
"Fun place, good food, however my boyfriend was there twice and got food poisoning both times.

"I went to AG Kitchen after it was recommended to me by a friend who went to Fordham. I was really in the mood for a good burger, and I went with my mom and we were both super hungry. We ordered the classic burger with guacamole and the cubano sandwich and also got the sangrias from the Yelp deal.

The atmosphere is bright and fun, and it helped that it was a sunny day outside. We went at around 3pm, which was an off-hour for lunch, so it was pretty quiet. The wait staff was a little overbearing, but that's probably because we were one of the only patrons there. You can sit in the patio area or in one of the tables or booths on the inside, and we opted for a booth. 

The food was very good, but not extraordinary. The burger, though claimed ""best burger of NYC"" was nothing compared to the cubano sandwich, which was absolutely incredible. The guacamole was also very well-done. 

I wasn't blown away by the food, but what made it worse was that we both felt super sick after eating there. Probably won't return just because of that.",1.0

Though previously enjoyed going there for a good meal, we will definitely not be going again in the near future nor will be recommend to others.",1.0
"Manager- you seem to think it was only our family friend's daughter that got poisoning from here. Our family ate here and also got sick. It would be a hell of a coincidence if the same ""number of factors"" affected another set of people who dined at the same restaurant nearly 5 days before. It was so bad that my mother reported it to the department of health. None of us have returned.",1.0
"Now, I don't believe in rage reviews, getting on Yelp to bash a place because of one small bad experience is irresponsible and just short of internet mob bullying. 

However, as I'm still feeling the severe pain of the food poisoning I received from this place, I can't help but make my opinion known. 

The food here is good, make no mistake. The rather low bar of ""best xlb in Manhattan"" is easy to award. And the innovations they take with the dumplings are appreciated. The dessert XLB stood out especially. 

The cooked dishes were standard Shanghainese/Sichuan fare (I wonder how many Sichuan restaurant owners in New York actually hail from Shanghai).

I did, however, dock two points. One because the service was spotty. We had difficulty getting water at our table, and at several points, the otherwise pleasant servers could not seem to understand what we were ordering. 

But then my troubles began. We were there in a large group, and every single person got food poisoning of varying severity. My buddy and I were the most affected, waking up in the night with severe pains in our stomach (and the other gross things that accompany such affliction). 

So, I want to acknowledge that the food was good, and the service was passable. The food poisoning may be one batch of cold dishes left out too long, or may be an isolated instance of spoiled meat. And my expectations are usually low when it comes to hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurants. But honestly, I think it is a reasonable expectation on the part of the consumer to not get food poisoning when going out to a somewhat more upscale (and expensive) eatery.",1.0
"I am an avid fan of Indian lunch buffets. They are probably my favorite dining experience bar none. I have eaten in many buffets from Syracuse, Ithaca, New York City, White Plains, and other areas. This place appeared to be great with so many options for just $9.95 and a relaxed environment. My gf and I decided to try it out and the food was relatively good.



The experience would have gotten 3 or 4 stars until the experience later that night. We both got terribly sick with what we could only assume was food poisoning because nothing else we ate that day could have produced that effect. I am not talking about a little queasiness. I mean our stomachs were revolting and we both felt terrible the entire night and next morning.



I now question the freshness of their buffet food and I suspect they keep leftovers from days before. Would not recommend going here unless you want to risk the worst stomach cramps and sickness that you have ever felt.",1.0

My girlfriend didn't eat much of what we had, but she also didn't feel too hot. We went right home after dinner, so Rosie's is 1000% the reason my weekend got ruined.

Food poison: I ate in this place for breakfast the other day in the morning with a friend. We order regular breakfast eggs and beans cream and tortilla with orange juice. After we finish 30 min later we both start feeling sick. I trow up (vomit) all the breakfast so bad at the bathroom's office for the appointment we had in the city. Had to run to the hospital because of the stomach pain and dizziness. After I got into the ER I stayed there for the whole day. They gave me some med's and last report from the doctor was food poison. Then a month later I got a bill for over $800 because of my insurance didn't cover my emergency visit and I had to make arrangements to keep my credit out of trouble and had to take large course of antibiotics because of these dirty place.

For pastas we got tagliatelle with ragu and spinach gnocchi with spicy red sauce. Tagliatelle was drenched in red sauce. I like that but maybe not for everyone. Spicy red sauce was so spicy it gave me a stomach ache. Should have stuck to red sauce. Pastas were average, hearty portions good for a cold night.
Tiramisu with dessert was covered in chocolate sauce. After scraping it off, tiramisu itself was pretty good.

"Come here if you want food poisoning! Because that's what I got!

I came here for dim sum. We ordered the beef tripe. It tasted wrong. Other people at my table felt the same way about it. We asked the waiter to take it back. He took it off our card and said ""These are internal organs. If you're not used to internal organs you shouldn't order it."" That left us very confused. Shouldn't order it because it you know you're serving spoiled food? Or shouldn't order it because we're not used to eating spoiled food? I don't get it. I know what beef tripe tastes like. It doesn't taste like that. Maybe you shouldn't serve that dish at all. Just saying.

The other dim sum was ok. I usually judge dim sum based on how good the shu mai is. Theirs was meh. I've also had dinner here in the past. It's ok. Nothing memorable.

I will say that the space is very nice. Much nicer than most Chinese restaurants. It's just sad because I really like the decor (and their bathroom is really nice unlike most Chinese places) but I really can't trust their dim sum anymore.",1.0

Although they refunded us and provided us with an apology, I have a 2-month-old daughter that I exclusively breastfeed, and can't express how traumatizing it was to try to nurse and take care of my daughter during this ordeal.

It may be cheap and tasty, but something is not happening there that should, in terms of cleanliness",1.0
Almost positive that the vanilla ice cream gave a friend and I food poisoning. My boyfriend had chocolate and was fine but within a few hours we were both sick. I should have suspected something was wrong from the icy texture. Apart from the poor food handling the ice cream was lackluster and the milkshakes were nothing more than icy milk.

"This is a completely AWFUL place. 

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with a coffee and added a water to it so me and my five year old can split the sandwich. 

My coffee was watered down, and I asked for it black with one sugar. So there was no chance of milk making it taste the way it did. Bottles water is bottled water, so there is no issue there. 

But the sandwich;

I cut it in half, and We each ate a half on the way home, I had a cold, and my smell and taste is off. The most uncomfortable feeling in the world to feel when you find out something bad is going to happen.

My five-year-old made a nasty face after a few bites, and started to cough. I immediately take the sandwich away and since I already ate mine, saw the other half eaten one. I opened it up, and there is all of these crumbs and mystery pieces of stuff, I guess melted in the cheese. I ate this? Worse, I fed this to a child?! 

My heart sank and sure enough twenty minutes later we're home and my-five-year-old is throwing up into the toilet. The throwing up lasted two days in a row,  I had to make a visit to the Pediatrician, and sure enough has minor food poisoning. So did I, but mine wasn't that bad, Over the years I've manifested an iron clad stomach for the most part, (Thank Mom for not knowing how to cook all those years, and a detrimental occurrence once before regarding undercooked pork. Thanks Mom)  


One week of meds for the little one and a soft foods/liquid diet, for not wanting to take the chance of anything taking too long to digest and coming up again.

My boyfriend and I ordered from seamless.com last night. We're new to the neighborhood, recently moved from Bay Ridge and missed good Halal food.

We still do.

Even with the first time discount from seamless of 20% this place wasn't worth it.  The falafel was some of the worst we've ever had (and there wasn't even any white sauce on the sandwich!!)  It was burnt and dry and flavorless. The small side of tahini sauce was brown and watery.

.... and to top it all off, we both woke up this morning with food poisoning.  I've been in and out of the bathroom all morning.

"Atmosphere is nice except for the fact that you can hear and feel the subway underneath every 5-7 minutes. Waiters were extremely inexperienced and generally did not contribute to a pleasurable dining experience. They spent most of their time speaking with one table that was Russian speaking and failed to pay attention to the other tables they were serving. Food was mediocre- the brussel sprouts plain, the mushrooms too oily, the Chilean sea bass chewy and flavorless. In addition, both people who dined here had severe food poising from this (we are physicians and know the signs and symptoms of food poisoning). After calling the restaurant to make them aware of this, they were extremely unprofessional. They kept passing the phone to someone else, were defensive and close minded and told me to ""sue them because their food was not bad so it must have been just me."" He also tried to suggest that I must have suddenly developed an allergy to shellfish further demonstrating his ignorance in all things medical and highlighting his pathetic attempt at covering up their mistakes. A restaurant with mediocre food who cannot hone up to mistakes and who does not desire to keep their customers will undoubtedly fail.

First off, when business grade was a C, they didn't have the grade posted on the glass door for the public to see...they had it in some hidden corner inside of their store near a plant. Secondly, I decided to try to this bakery because of all the rave and ""good"" things I heard about it. My boyfriend and I are from out of town and we decided to give this place a try. THE FOOD is a GRAND ILLUSION. It may taste and look good, but it made me and my boyfriend have a terrible case of food poison. We both had liquidy diarrhea with chills and cold sweats on that same day we ate from that store that lasted for days. I knew something conspicuous was going on in the back when I saw the department of health grade hiding in the corner and I should have listened to my instinct when I saw that grade they was trying to hide.

By the time I got to the lunch room the only items left were the cous cous, squash, and sauce.

It turns out we both had acute food poisoning, putting us both out of commission that night and for the next day. I went to see the manager as soon as I could to let him know what happened.  And this is where it got strange: instead of asking how we were feeling, he asked what I ate and did I have seafood, and I told him ""no, just steak for two."" And then it got even stranger: he said ""well I don't know. I hope we'll see you again soon."" Not even an apology! My response was ""no.""

Add to this experience that we have -- twice -- asked for chicken parmigiana heroes with extra marinara sauce on the side. Well, both times the heroes came completely devoid of all sauce, and with a small cup of it on the side. It seemed clear to us -- twice -- that a chicken parmigiana hero should still have sauce on it, but ""extra"" sauce would mean ""additional"" on the side. Perhaps we're the ones who are wrong. Either way, we've lived in Riverdale for about 10 months now and have ordered from Mr. Nick's about four times. The food, the service, the general competence and -- apparently -- the washing of the pizza-maker's hands -- have left a great deal to be desired.

Waitress/hostess agreed and we were on our way there when another hostess dashed out and aggressively stopped us saying all the tables outside of the bar area were reserved.  

Ok.  Except we looked over for the next hour and half and there were actually a number of open tables there the whole time.

About half an hour after the meal, we both started having stomach issues.  This was the only food we had all morning, and my guess is either the shashuka or chocolate egg cream my boyfriend ordered, as he ended up having a much more severe case than me, which was literally the worst in his years of living in NYC, a place not exactly revered for food sanitation.  As an aside, if you ever end up with stomach issues, I hope they don't come up for you in the middle of a long subway ride...

All in all, I really like the place in concept and have had good experiences there in the past, but even one case of food poisoning is one too many.  Combine with disappointing service, and I have to say it's a pass.",1.0
"I had food poisoning last night (2/17/15) and will NEVER go here again. I tried the Lillie's on 17th years ago and the ambience was great so when I was meeting a friend in the neighborhood I was excited to see a Lillie's on 49th. I had the truffle fries which were fine and the tuna tartar (since there weren't many vegetarian options). I was sick all night and am still recovering today.

The bartender also forgot to give my friend her credit card, and we paid with cash. My friend had the pastrami sandwich and she said she wasn't feeling well last night either (not as bad as me since the toilet was my best friend and I could barely hold down water). We paid about $140 for us to have terrible food.

I also realized someone else got food poisoning from lobster and something else in June 2014, but that review is hidden but if you look for it you will find it. It seems they need to do a better job with their seafood/fish dishes or maybe not offer it at all.",1.0
"FOOD POISONING! Don't eat here! Not only did we spend the night vomiting up our meal, when we were in the restaurant and we complained it didn't taste right, the women behind the counter began yelling at us in Chinese.",1.0
"DANGER: FOOD POISONING! This place was firmly on track for a two or three star review. Food was average, Bloody Mary was from a pre-made mix, and coffee tasted like burnt Nescafé. It was no surprise that was the only place that had an open table at 12:30 on a Saturday. But this restaurant earned a solid one star rating when at 5:00 pm, two friends became violently ill. Both had the crab cake Benedict and both tasted it again when they vomited it out of the cab window. Avoid this place at all costs -- unless paying $25 for an evening of vomiting is your sort of thing.",1.0
"So yesterday I attended a brunch at Poco. It was nice at first, lively atmosphere, a private space for our 40 person party- overall good energy.  We ordered our food, had some drinks, some laughs, and then eventually, some pretty sick ladies. You know the feeling when food doesn't settle well and the rumbling you feel in your stomach evokes an ominous and inevitable need to expel bodily fluids? Well this is what about a dozen of us experienced subsequent to leaving this establishment. They offer a menu item called 'The Cure'- an ironic misnomer to a plate of breakfast nachos that landed some of us doubled over praying to the porcelain gods later that afternoon.

'Poco' must mean 'a little food poisoning'

Stick to booze only at this place",1.0
Went here for the lunch buffet. Good price but bad food. This place gave me food poisoning. I know it wasn't just me because I went with a bunch of my coworkers and we all had stomach issues after eating here. I would never go back. Beware!,1.0
"DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO FALL VICTIM TO FOOD POISONING!!!!

We ordered the following for dinner (excuse my Konglish):
tang soo yook
jjam ppong -----  POISON
jja jang myun 

This is not my first time here and I never really liked this place because it is not very tasty, but I was craving jja jang myun so I came with a friend anyway. We shared all the dishes, and I had only a small bowl of the jjam ppong which we later found out though hives on my face and my friend being completely food poisoned that it most definitely consisted of seafood gone bad.

Waiter also stuck his thumb in the food while serving.

I'm curious how many people they got sick last night. Seriously, take your money elsewhere. There are PLENTY of good Korean restaurants in the area.",1.0
"hey guys - we generally love you and your food. however last night/this morning you made my husband very sick.  was confirmed as food poisoning and not a virus.  it was the only thing he ate yesterday which was your chicken dumplings.

"This is our after work spot - we are regular customers. The food and drink is not cheap, but we find it convenient. Unfortunately, last night, we went there with our work friends and had a great time until we got home. Four of us got food poisoning from the things we ate and drank. We called the manager, Alberto, the next day and he was very unhelpful and trying to blame it on something else we must have eaten. But we know it had to be that food. We ate the vegetarian eggplant dish, and lots of the thin pizza and the meatballs. We are supposed to go there tonight for another work party, but we all refused to go because the manager refused to apologize and didn't return our phone call after his ""investigation"". The party tonight is officially OFF. We will be taking our business elsewhere - no more food poisoning after spending $500 for us anymore.",1.0
"My husband and I stopped in to try the grilled pork bahn mis and they were absolutely delicious.  

We both got sick, though.  We aren't sure if it was them or the salads we had later that day, though.  The place has an ""A"", so I'm hoping it wasn't them. Either way, the sandwiches were delicious, but food poisoning is no fun!",1.0
"Id give zero stars if it was an option! Came in Friday night (4/3/2015) for a nice dinner with my boyfriend. I got the Ravioli Bella Nonna and he got the steak. Got home and started feeling sick.

"I went there wednesday night an hour before they close. The salsa bar has a couple flies around but I already ordered my food so I stayed there anyway, My wife said the bathroom is not too clean but I think that doesn't have direct relationship with food taste.

The chips I got was cold, not that fresh,,,,can't blame them when i go an hour before they close.
I got the Taco combo with 2 fish + 1 shrimp, they are ok, but in comparison to the two Mexican fast food: Pinatas ( Hicksville) and Green Cactus ( Roslyn) , the taste and freshness is not near their food...
I wanted to give it two stars but I got sick from it so I couldn't. 
I got home after dinner and my stomach feel weird, slight feel like Diarrhea is coming. 
I went to sleep anyway and next morning I have Diarrhea, follow with on and off cold sweat and weird stomach ache the entire day. Still have slight Diarrhea at night.

That's the first time I got sick from Mexican food. Now I learned I have to be careful to choose what to eat...

 
I am sure that doesn't happen to everyone, otherwise they will be closed already, lucky me, what can I say",1.0
"I am just recovering 3 days later from the most horrendous food poisoning experience in my 28 years on earth. In additions to the two ""traditional"" symptoms which don't really need to be spelled out, I have had fevers, chills, dizziness, and extreme weakness in my entire body for about 60 hours. Tang is the only thing I ate that entire day and was completely healthy going into the meal. I am 100% certain it was from eating there. Fried pork dumplings and beef with broccoli. Never again. Never again.",1.0
"I went here several times and ordered the delicious Maggie Brown--jalapeno cheese grits with a battered fried egg on top--every time. The Maggie Brown was no less delicious than it was all of the other times the last time I went. But this time I got a severe case of food poisoning that I probably should've gone to the hospital for. I live by myself and I literally couldn't move off the floor in front of my toilet into which i was vomiting for 5 hours. I've never not been able to move translationally in that condition. At one point I fainted while vomiting, hit my head on the toilet and didn't wake up for a few hours. When I did wake up wedged between my toilet and the wall, I cried because I was so happy to be waking up and I was far less delirious than I was before fainting. This is by far the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had. And it probably sounds kinda funny, but I assure you it was not. Once I was able to move enough to get myself some fluids, I got over to my phone and called my best friend who I'd gone to Maggie Brown's with. She had a similar experience. But while I was drastically improved the next day and in recovery, she continued to vomit every few hours for 3 full days after that first night. If you search ""food poisoning"" on these their yelp reviews right now, you get 3 hits not counting this one. This is way too many in my opinion. Our cases were so severe that I decided to check their health department inspection violations which I encourage everyone to do--especially for places you eat often--if you're bored and want to be horrified or pleasantly surprised. I used to think health code violations somehow gave a place street cred--even though that makes no sense. Not anymore. I mean there are surely violations that are more critical than others--so make sure to read violations carefully and not judge a place too harshly sheerly by number of violations. Anyway Maggie Brown's seems to be improving with each inspection which is good. But because of the number of cases, I'd be sure to check their latest violations and ask yourself if you feel lucky. And that goes for any place where you get hits for searching ""food poisoning"". The following critical violations (I left the non-critical violations out) are publicly available by searching Maggie Brown at http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do.

"Went to get ramen (miso and mega) last night to help soothe my sore throat.  Sadly, I did not know that I would exchange one illness for another.  That's right, both my fiance and I got food poisoning from our ramen last night.  This was my first time at Totto, and I will not be returning. I highly advise that management look into this issue, because if we both got sick last night, I'm sure it's not an isolated case.",1.0
"Went here for lunch with my wife and we both got sick. I had a chicken caesar wrap, she had a salad. Turns out my brother in law went here as well and got food poisoning. Not sure if anything there is cooked properly or prepared the right way, but I won't come back here for any food off the grill or at the salad bar.",1.0
"I have been here twice now for brunch. The first time here I had a good experience even thought they gave me the wrong order. The second time I got food poisoning (this weekend). I had the salmon blt which taste great but unfortunately it made me sick. Had to go to urgent care. I took a picture and you can clearly see that it's undercooked compared to the first time I had it. I called them to tell them what happened and the GM was not even empathetic to the situation. I hope no one has had this experience, I get that it's a busy restaurant but not cooking food properly is unacceptable.",1.0
"Oh Empanada Mama, I honestly wanted to give you 4 stars.  I truly truly did, but ... well ... I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning shortly after eating here.

On our food-venture through New York, we stopped at Empanada Mama for a snack.  Who am I kidding?  Two empanadas alone could serve as a full on meal for me.  And that's what I had, 2 empanadas.  The Desayuno Columbiano and Viagra were my choices.

The place was so crowded, when a spot opened outside, we decided to bear the cold and take a seat.  They offered us plantain chips and huac in the beginning of our meal.  By the way, it's not free/complimentary.  Something we found out when we got our check.  However, we didn't mind, as the chips and guacamole were actually pretty good.

We received our empanadas in a good amount of time.  The salsa.  My friend, Emily C., and I agreed the green sauce was definitely the best.  I'll take the green over the red sauce any day.  The Desayuno Columbiano was my first choice.  At first bite, I knew I loved it.  The cheese and different flavors just melted in my mouth.  I honestly stated to my friend I wished it would regenerate and create another one so I didn't have to eat the last bite.  But alas, all good things must come to an end.  The Viagra was also really good.  The seafood was excellent, and the sauce that was in it was not too overpowering.  Leaving just taste of everything that was crammed into that empanada.  

It's a small place, so on a busy Saturday afternoon, like we went, it was crowded.  Walk in and write your name on the clipboard.  Then wait patiently.

As I said before, I had to mark it down.  We were pretty sure it was the Viagra empanada, as that is the only one food for the whole day the both of us had, and we both got sick shortly after eating here.

I'll come again though, but probably next time stay away from that one specific empanada.  Maybe then I can rate it higher.",1.0
"Great waitress, really, BUT:

BEWARE NEVERTHELESS! Horrible, over priced food. We are both on the verge of food poisoning at the moment. NO KIDDING. We both bent over the snow to puke a few minutes after the ordeal. Wish I had a snap shot of my friend trying to convulsively getting it out of her system.

The food is, and believe me, it is MY FIRST REVIEW EVER OF ANY KIND, truly disgusting. 

We started with the Smoked Mozzarella & Ricotta Fritters, which were so tiny we were taken aback but the we thought ... ""small but perhaps heavenly"", European style. But sadly there were insipid and impossible to recall the flavor.

Roasted Beets & Aged Goat Cheese. Ordinary Del Monte canned beets with a tear provoking  hard chevre cheese below. Balsamic sauce my ass.

Salmon: A disgrace. I would have cooked it better anytime.I tasted cheap and frozen. Boiled in salt water. GROSS. 
Grilled Skirt Steak: That one takes the prize home. Three folded pieces of a poor cow. WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW. 
Raw, impossible to cut even with the designated knife. I ate on, as I thought it must be me, since the dish was $29.

First and last time, never again. It is one of the worst restaurants I have been to in the city, where I have been eating out for over 10 years.


Save yourself the cash and the stomach ache. 

Sorry to the nice waitress, and the staff. The water guy was so helpful and polite. But........I can not recommend this place.",1.0
"We didn't drink. I can't speak to that. 

The sides were good. We liked both the cheese grits and cornbread.

But allow me to refrain from mincing my words.
This place should be ashamed of it's 'que. Paper bag over your head, can't show yourself at proper butcher. Scratch out the word ""Smokehouse"" from your name. That level of shame.

Just talking places in the city: I've had Mighty Quinn's, Virgil's, Fette Sau, Alchemy, Blue Smoke. This was the worst BBQ in the city and the worst I've had in my entire life. 

This was like eating an entirely different food group. If you asked someone to interpret BBQ using shoddy cuts of meat, perhaps for the palate of a dog (not even a beloved dog) you might get this. I'm serious, I ate it 3 days ago and I'm still upset about it.

The ribs had no flavor. I could not detect any dry rub. There was no sauce, nor was there sauce on the table or anywhere we could see to add later. There was no smoke flavor, no char. Utterly flavorless. Had the quality of a boiled rib.

The brisket was on another level of bad. Brisket is supposed to be soft, fatty, melt in your mouth. This was chunks of fat and gristle that made it inedible. The quality of the meat was so tough I questioned whether it was really brisket. My fiance powered through a slice of it, I had one bite and had to stop.

My guy and I both got a mild stomach ache after this food and it lasted through the next day, we wondered if it was a mild food poisoning. 

And to really drive home the point that this place has nothing to offer: They featured a little country band that I really wanted to like...but the lead singer proudly wore a cowboy hat featuring the Mississippi flag, which if you've never seen it, contains a full representation of the confederate flag within its standard. I know you might be awfully proud of your state, but please just refrain.",1.0
"My boyfriend and a friend ate there yesterday and both had a chicken sandwich. He came home with a huge stomach ache, the runs, and threw up. He developed a fever immediately. He was taken to the hospital in where he was told it was in fact food poisoning. His friend the very next day developed the same symptoms. I called the restaurant and spoke with Faith who was very apologetic about the event and assured me that they keep their items at the appropriate temp or cook. Whatever that non-existing temp might that be. She also questioned as to how do I know that it was their food? I reminded her that two people ate the same thing in the same place and both got sick! This is why mediocre restaurants like these will never ever see my money. I will be DEF be going back there, with his medical bills!!",1.0
"Daizen is the same price as the other AYCE sushi out there. Honestly, I think this place by far is the best AYCE sushi restaurant I've tried. There's free and unlimited soda + refills, which others don't have. Service is pretty good and the kani salad was amazing. I tried a lot of their rolls and they were better than the ones I tried at Sake, Shogun and Ohsho. The menu had other varieties of cuisines too, which I liked. 

It was my second time coming here since I loved the food there. This time my friends and I ordered a lot, 3 of them being tuna rolls. I don't like tuna so I only ate 1-2 pieces, and so did my friends. My boyfriend ate most of it because he was the only one who actually liked tuna. 

The reason why I'm giving Daizen 4 stars however, is because the tuna wasn't fresh or it was poisoned. Normal tuna would be purplish, but it was almost black. I don't understand why they didn't throw it out.. My friends and I also had to look for a bathroom after because of the tuna. NOT ONLY THAT, but after we left, my boyfriend had discomfort in his stomach. (HE NEVER GETS SICK. He hasn't thrown up for over 10 years too..) We walked for a bit and the discomfort continued and he started to feel nauseous. He threw up 5 times within an hour and became weak. It has been over a day and he's still sick, but now with a severe headache and a sore throat. I searched up the symptoms and I found out that it was probably Scombroid poisoning or even Ciguatera poisoning, something you would get from poisoned tuna.

I would've gave Daizen a 5, but because someone got sick from the fish, it lost a star. I really hope they do something about it to prevent further Scombroid or Ciguatera poisoning in others.",1.0
Gross. We got food poisoning afterwards. Their burger tastes like they used dogfood meat of some sort! The delivery man told us that we needed to give him cash when we had already paid online.,1.0
"BEWARE FOOD POISONING!
Don't get me wrong...this can happen anywhere. But I will say that I ordered the mixed seafood platter (which FYI ain't cheap) and it arrived warm, not hot and that included extremely mushy lemon potatoes. Long story short ...both my wife and I were laid up for two days recovering. Back to Kyclades, I've been going there on and off for about 10 years and have noticed a significant drop off on the quality of their food. Back to the seafood...shrimp, lobster, scallops and clams were all rubbery and had no taste...just overcooked rubbery texture. I think Kyclades is well beyond their high point, if you go and something doesn't look or smell right, don't hesitate!",1.0
"Only order from this place if you feel like permanently changing your gut flora. Within 12 hours of ordering delivery from this place, the boyfriend and I both came down with a horrible case of food poisoning. I'm talking literally 4 days of food poisoning -- no exaggeration. 

Before you ask, no, we don't normally subsist entirely on a bland diet of white bread and boiled chicken. We often eat extremely spicy food and are no stranger to street meat with red sauce. 

So yeah, order at your own peril.",1.0
"I am very disappointed with the service of the restaurant. I had the ravioli fritti and calamari as the appetizers. My friend had the Fusilli Napoletani and I had the Fettuccine al Funghi. What was supposed to be a great meal during Happy Hour turned out to be a disaster. 

After nearly halfway done with our meals, my friend started having chills, sweating profusely, and nauseous symptoms. I notified our server who got me the manager, Gino. I spoke and informed him that my friend was not feeling well and I told him it was the food. My friend had her head down the entire time and Gino offered me hot tea and to turn up the AC. He told me that the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene came just yesterday (8/4/2015) and they had inspected everything and everything was fine. He was very confident with the visit and that there were no violations. Gino also mentioned that my friend could not have food poisoning because it does not happen until the day after eating or within a few hours. I googled the symptoms and it is possible that it could happen within an hour or two. So, get the facts straight. After five minutes, it was not any better. I told our waiter to get the manager once again since he told me that he was right across the street. Our waiter came back within 5 minutes and told me that if this was a case that my friend was not feeling well, there was nothing he could do. The manager had asked the waiter to tell us this since he couldn't come over. If he was right across the street, he could've been more than understanding to assist us. This shows that the manager does not care about his customers, especially when he was right across the street. As a manager who is supposed to run and care for his customers, he was not around to follow up with this issue. So, I brought it to Yelp to let others know about this ordeal. I am not sure if we were Asian, because I am sure if it was anyone else, the manager would have been more helpful with this situation. 

My friend literally could not stay at the restaurant any longer and we had to cab it back. 

I am more than disappointed with the service and according to the NYC Department of Health and Hygiene, I just checked their ratings. Even though they have an A rating, look at the violations. This contributes to the fact that my friend had food poisoning because of the symptoms and it lasted for three days. I have submitted a claim report to the NYC Department of Health and Hygiene. 

I get that restaurants have violations and the most important one is the one listed in red. This is another evident reason that this situation was because of the violation (the visit was just the day before we eat)

Below is the link to the violations the restaurant has:

So it pains me to write this because Arturo's is definitely one of my favorite pizza spots in NYC but I got food poisoning from them Wednesday night. My friend and I ate the same thing and we were both vomiting all night. I am telling myself that it was not the cheese pizza we ate (since the pizza there is the best) but rather the caesar salad dressing...either raw eggs or bad anchovies in the dressing?? I have no idea but I hope no one else came across that problem recently.,1.0
"I had lunch yesterday Sat Dec 13, 2014 at Caffe Storico with a friend. We both got food poisoning. We shared a Ceasar salad and I had the pasta with duck ragu. I was violently ill vomiting and diareah. It's 4:30pm on Sunday and I still feel ill. I talked to the manager Christian and he said he would talk to the chef. I had to ask for a credit for lunch. I would never eat here again and you shouldn't either!",1.0
"Horrible. My company ordered pizzas and salads from Golosi the other day and 4 of us were immediately stricken with food poisoning, most likely from a prosciutto pizza. I am now in my 5th day of a violent case of food poisoning. We called to tell the manager but he never called back. Never order from here unless you feel like being confined to your apartment with horrible stomach issues for an extended period of time.",1.0
"Eh, No thanks. Ever.

I have awful service from a few rude waitresses.  I even came early so I didn't have to be in the midst on a packed place. 

The service was slow, the bathrooms were terribly messy. It took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge that we were sitting there.  I even asked for more water and she just rolled her eyes and said something in Japanese to her coworker. I'm sure she was talking about me.

On top of all that, I had FOOD POISONING, along with all my other friends from their motsunabe (large intestine soup).  Either it was not cleaned well because it didn't sit in my stomach and I threw up for the whole night and next day.

Just be careful everyone!",1.0
"Wow, this place has totally gone down the drain.  I've been here too many times to count and it gets worst each time.  I remember when I first came here, I thought this place was the shit.  Great sushi selection and a great selection of hot foods if sushi wasn't your thing.  

I was here this past weekend and we both got food poisoning accompanied by fevers.  I don't know what we ate, but whatever it was, we're sick and we're still trying to get over it.  This place isn't as clean as it used to be.  Just take a look at the food and you can tell it was haphazardly thrown together and possibly contaminated with whatever caused us to get sick.  

The sushi tasted okay and I didn't feel anything was off about it.  You can tell the sushi quality has gone down though since the rice they use is not the proper rice.  We had a few oysters and the oysters were extremely low grade oysters.  Perhaps this was why we got sick.  They were super tiny and did not look fresh.  

The hot foods here used to be good, but nowadays, a lot of the hot foods consist of really cheap stuff.  A majority of the stuff is now all breading and fried.  A lot of the stuff was burned, over fried and not edible.  

This place used to give you a drink for free, but that ship has long sailed.  The drinks now cost $2.95.  We got some tap water and the tap water looked really dirty.  I don't suggest drinking it since it tasted funny.  Just looking at the servers clean up the tables, cups and plates made me cringe since you could tell their hands were cross contaminating between the dirty plates/cups and with the clean ones and also whatever dirty rag they were using to clean the tables.  These servers were not wearing gloves so this is a serious issue.  

The dessert here used to be good, but now, all of it is bland and tasteless.  The green tea froyo used to taste good, but now it is all watered down.  Seriously, how cheap can it be to make froyo?  I don't understand the need to water down the froyo.  

This place has also instituted a 90 minute limit which is sad because this shows this place cares more about money than pleasing their customers.  

I never thought this day would come, but sadly, it has and I will no longer be back.  If you are going to be charging so much, at least have a presentable place, serve good food and be clean.  I can't stress the cleanliness factor enough.  Maybe if management stops cutting corners and revert back to how they used to operate when they first opened, they would get better reviews.  All this place cares about is how much money they make.  Avoid this place like the plague if you don't want to get sick.",1.0
"Ordered a mushroom/garlic pizza last night.  The pizza tasted OK and the crust tasted a little different than your standard pizza, but the husband-man and I didn't really think anything of it.

Avoid, avoid, avoid, unless you're willing to pay multiple visits to the porcelain god next day.",1.0
"FOOD POISONING! My wife and I walked into this shop on Austin Street on Sunday afternoon after sharing lunch and dinner the day before and brunch that morning with six other family members. We both had the exact same thing: a medium cup with a scoop of Rocky Road and a scoop of Dolce De Lece. The two guys working behind the counter did not look like they were working in an ice cream shop as they wore street clothes and no apron. We ate our ice cream, went home and became violently Ill five hours later. I'm talking ""please let me die right now"" sick. Our bodies were purging every 15-30 minutes from both ends all night long with never ending cold sweats and abdominal pain. It wasnt pretty. When the smoke cleared 24 hours later we were depleted, our bodies dehydrated and empty. At that point, after realizing that we were going to survive this obvious food poisoning, we began the careful process of elimination to help confirm what made us sick. In the end it was clear. EXCEPT FOR THE HAAGEN DAZ, every other morsel of food and every other sip of drink that we consumed during the preceding 24 hours was shared with close family members....and none of them had a single symptom.  At that point we asked ourselves: Can ice cream really give you food poisoning? Then we recalled the recent Listeria outbreak caused by Blue Bell Ice Cream and realized exactly what happenned to us. Be careful.",1.0
"I had lunch here with a friend. We weren't impressed with the food. I got the Braunschweiger and I was not able to finish it ( felt kind of stale). More importantly, we both got food poisoning. I had an upset stomach but hers was more severe. she had to spend the day out of work and in bed.

I called to let them know about this. The gentleman on the phone was polite and apologetic and said that he will investigate the situation and will call me back.

"Even the one star is too much for this place! Service is bad at best, and the food can make you sick!  I was there on June 6 to celebrate a triple birthday, I and two companions decided to wait for the rest of the dinner party by having cocktails in the patio; first of all - I had a hard time getting a table outside, even though 90% of the tables outside were empty! their hostess has a bad attitude! she only offered a table after my two male companions asked for it! then came the really bad part, we got Tuna Tartare and Fried calamari for appetizers to go along with our drinks; the tuna tasted like nothing! however, it made all three of us sick - we got food poisoning!
two days later, when I was feeling better, I called the restaurant and spoke with Tina, who assured me that their general manager was going to call me (GM?) well, I am still waiting! luckily my credit card company gave credit for the bad food! and the coup de gras was when I got my credit card statement they overcharged me for a cake that I ordered for the table!",1.0
"I want to love you, Saraghina. I want to.

Update: I went back and tried the pizza; it was delicious. Seriously. My partner and I split some calamari and a half-liter of house wine, which was great. 

Then we both got food poisoning! 

Both of us were unbelievably sick for almost a day afterwards. So, that sucked. I would have overlooked it if it was just one of us, but seriously. Clean up your kitchen and store your seafood responsibly! It's hard to keep eating your food when it doesn't stay down.",1.0
"My worst experience with pakistani food ever. The chicken was stale. 4 of my family members had severe food poisoning after having food from this place. I would never ever go here and I'd suggest everybody not to go here either, if you care about your stomach that is. This place SUCKS!",1.0
Food poisoning!! I am current in excruciating pain after contaminated eggs here last weekend.We ate dinner and went to a party with friends all day prior; and only the two of us who ate breakfast at Ruby's got sick. I haven't eaten anything substantial in almost 3 days and might have to go to the ER. Beware!!,1.0
"If you value your health, DO NOT EAT HERE. I ordered delivery and it tasted great...however, next morning I was vomiting from food poisoning. My boyfriend had two bites of my meal and he had terrible diarrhea. I called the manager and asked that they please refund my money for the sickening experience and they outright refused, and were very rude and denied it altogether. A horrible experience, coupled with their unprofessional management team. ALTOGETHER THE WORST INDIAN EXPERIENCE EVER. THEY DESERVE TO BE CLOSED DOWN.",1.0
"Loved the intimate feel, but I think I got food poisoning here. 

1. Oxtail dumpling soup was very good

2. Veggie ravioli was not bad! Although EATALY is better and cheaper. 

3. Spaghetti with uni was eh. Was tomato-y and uni tasting. Not very interesting. 

5. The veggie sides were DRENCHED in butter. 


Both if us had queasy weird stomachs the next day, and mine turned into sharp pains late night next day until I made myself throw up. Weird since I usually have the iron stomach. Not sure what the deal was, since I think bad food would make you immediately sick.


But this is not imaginative amazing multidimensional food. I feel like they think the solution to everything is just more butter. 


But get the dessert!!! Their pastry chef is from per se, and it shows.",1.0
"I normally would not write a review for a place like this b/c the solid reputation on yelp  is normally right for a high end place like this that's also been around for years.  However, i am giving it 1 star because of my experience tonight.  While the food was very delicious while we were eating it, my husband and I came home with what started with stomach cramps, which later revealed itself as a milder form of food poisoning.  We both ate the same things (black miso cod, uni don, egg souffle w/ truffles & fish flown that day from Tsujiki fish market)  & we both  had the similar experience & which occurred at the same time:  first  feeling very full, then nauseous while also gassy, and  stomach cramps and diarrhia  soon after we ate.   We have been at this restaurant on 2 other occasions before and never had this happen.  Plus, I have a strong stomach and this is my first time getting sick from sushi.

This was supposed to be special occasion (my husband's birthday) and while we  enjoyed the food when it came out, it ruined the rest of the evening.  Not only was dinner very expensive, but even at a nice place like this  you can get sick;",1.0
"The food was not bad, except that four of us ate here and all of us got severe food poisoning. It's just not safe to eat here. Maybe we ate the unlucky batch of poisonous food; it's still safer to stay away if you don't like to be kept awake all night by the periodic stomach/intestine cramp and diarrhea.",1.0

"FOOD POISONING. BE CAREFUL!!! 

We were a party of 6 adults, a toddler and an infant and we ate here last Saturday for my parents 30th wedding anniversary. Now I ate here numerous times with my husband but I never noticed the B rating that's posted right at the door of the entrance.

We were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant. I didn't like where we sat because I thought they would forget about us and not serve us the meats. I was wrong. I give this restaurant a 2 because we had such a great server. I wish I remembered his name. He was so nice and was very attentive and friendly. He also had the other servers rotate the meats very often. Everything was delicious and we all had a fun time. 

Fast forward to Sunday (the day after our family dinner at Rainhas) My husband told me he didn't feel well. He had a bad stomach ache and as the day progressed his sickness got worse. He threw up numerous times and had a fever at the end of the night. I spoke to my mom and she told me she's been feeling nauseous and hasn't had any appetite since the dinner. Both of my sisters felt the same way. One of them ended up vomiting with a fever too. My other sister had really bad stomach pains that she couldn't even stand up straight and was pretty much crouching the rest of the day along with nausea. Our three year old daughter had diarrhea and was complaining about having a tummy ache. Its Thursday and they still don't have their full appetites back yet and one is still recovering from a fever.

I wish I could give this place more stars since the food was good and the service was top notch but with more than half of our party having food poisoning directly after the dinner I can only give Rainhas 2 stars.",1.0
"The only advice I'll give, is to not come here at all. Although there aren't many sushi spots in the Bronx, I'd recommend going for good quality sushi rather then a place that gives you food poisoning. 

With that being said, back to the review.
The service was horrible. There was only one other table that was seated in the restaurant (should've got the clue to leave then) and the waitress was rude and impatient. She did not even bother checking on me and my boyfriend. 
The food was even worse. The miso soup was cold. The salad dressing that was thrown on top of the salad smelled and looked like it was spoiled. We barely touched either. The sashimi was definitely NOT fresh, and the sushi was falling apart. 

Instantaneously after our meal, we both felt sick. But when we arrived home. It was official. We both got food poisoning. 
Point is, save your money and your stomach.",1.0
"Sooo... when half your party gets food poisoning that's probably a bad thing, right?  
Not sure where it all went wrong, but went here during the week and 50% of the party spent the night sick. Ordered most of the appetizers, a paella, and a few entrees... so no telling what made them ill.   The service was perfectly fine and friendly (hence the 2 stars).  The alcohol was a bit pricey per glass, but tolerable.  However, I think we'll probably steer clear of here aside from drinks going forward.  Although I wasn't one of them that suffered... I have been down that road enough times to know that it's no fun to pay almost $100 p/p for food that's going to launch an attack on your stomach later that night.",1.0
"A group of friends and I tried the Spicy Cumin Lamb Ding Ding at Taste Asia Food Festival. It was very good IMO. However, our days after the festival weren't so good... turns out we all had an extreme case of food poisoning from it.

"THIS RESTAURANT IS A SERIOUS HEALTH HAZARD! I came to grab a late night meal so I bought a cheesesteak with fries. It was a decent meal and I left satisfied but a little bloated. EIGHT HOURS LATER I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM! I was up all night with severe food poisoning and had to call an ambulance when it came to the point that I couldn't move ten steps without vomiting. The hospital put me on an IV as a source of hydration while I waited out the diagnosed gastroenteritis, which is caused by poorly prepared food or contaminated water (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroenteritis). New York has incredibly high standards for its water quality - it doesn't take much to guess what the cause was.

My cheesesteak and fries caused me to lose SEVEN POUNDS and gave me a fat bill from the ER. Don't eat here. Ever.",1.0
"FOOD POISONING!!!

OMG!! I got the worst food poisoning imaginable here! It went on for 3 days with the worst kind of symptoms! I had to stay home from work the whole time! I know I got sick here, because I hadn't eaten anything before or after for a long time and my boyfriend took some bites from my plate and he started to feel bad as well.
Now I can't even think about chicken and waffles without feeling ill! 

I will NEVER come here again!!",1.0
"This place is my families and friends favorite buffet. Always the same food but always good! 



The reason why I'm giving this place a 2 star instead of 4 or 5 is that my husband, mother in law, uncle, aunts, cousins and me came here on Thursday night, enjoyed our food and went home with food poisoning. 



Some of the family members felt sick right away, and some the next day. I first thought it was the raw oysters, but the kids didn't eat that.. The only thing we all had was the salmon.. So my July 4th weekend was me hovering the toilet vomiting and sleeping.",1.0
"This place has gone SO downhill :((( The old location that closed was genius, everything I ever had there was perfect. Now there's only this one location left. 
I'm from Michigan, and I had always made it a point to come here when I was in NY. I was there like a month ago and it wasn't great, went one more time this past week, and I won't be going back everrrr again. Let's just start by saying this place used to be ALL vegetarian and vegan... Clearly since the other location closed, maybe they're having some financial problems, so they need to get more people in the door.. so SURPRISE, they also serve REALLL meat now. I ordered one fake meat side, and then another (what I thought was fake) appetizer, come to find out, I ate real meat for the first time in about 10 years. :((((( I threw up later that night, and another friend I was with had the real meat too, and he threw up that night AND the next morning! And he actually eats meat! So it wasn't just me, it was food poisoning. And we were both SO sick and nauseous the entire next day.. Couldn't go out, couldn't drink, ruined the whole day. I'm so sad to say, but this business isn't what it used to be. Save your tummy, steer clear. :(((",1.0
"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! 

Last time I was here my boyfriend and I GOT FOOD POISONING! 

YES, FOOD POISONING, as in we were vomiting and sick all night. We ordered a philadelphia roll and a shrimp tempura roll, and were sick almost immediately. WHAT KIND OF FOOD ARE THEY SERVING?! We were seated right by the front, the staff clearly saw what was happening and did nothing to help. In the midst of the commotion and since I was so SHOCKED at what was unfolding, I paid the bill anyway and left.. REALLY kicking myself for that. I really regret paying for rotten food. Also, right before eating, my bf had commented that the sushi looked a little weird. I know- we should have stopped then instead of giving the place the benefit of the doubt. 

UGH, I still have nightmares about this place!! Save yourself the pain and go somewhere else!!!",1.0
"I don't feel great about giving a negative review to this business, but it is well-deserved in this case. I've eaten Hill Country Barbecue 10+ times, and I've always enjoyed it, however my most recent experience has been bad enough to negate my love for this place. 

Tuesday night (09.02.14), my S.O. and I ordered delivery. We got the brisket, pork, green bean casserole, baked beans and coleslaw, all of which I've had before and enjoyed. This time, both of us got food poisoning. I had HCB for dinner that night, as well as leftovers for breakfast the next morning. I started feeling ill yesterday, as did my S.O. and it is even worse today. I spoke to a coworker (I work across the street from Hill Country), who said he had gotten sick a month before, also from the brisket. 

I have a very strong constitution and have never had a food related issue this serious before. I understand that this is probably some kind of fluke, and I know that bad things happen to the best of businesses, but I feel so sick right now that I don't think I'll ever try Hill Country or any of their affiliated restaurants again.",1.0

No spice or flavoring whatsoever. The worst thing about it was after dinner, my partner and I both had cramps and stomach aches. I went to bed thinking it would pass, but at 2 am, I was in the bathroom with a terrible case of food poisoning - vomiting. So terrible I had to call in sick to work the next day.

"On the valentine's day me and my boyfriend decided to go to a steak house. After reading a lot of great reviews about Prime and Beyond, we went there. The place turned out to be a cute cosy intimate restaurant, which was great because you expect steakhouses to be big and noisy.  The staff was extremely nice. We ordered bacon appetizer, that everybody on Yelp were so fond off. Well, it tasted like fat especially when it got a little cold it became uneatable.
For the main corse we ordered $52 filet mignon, side of Brussels sprouts and potato salad only to find out that the restaurant run out of potatoes. How is that possible? So they didn't have even mashed potatoes, my fav side for the meat. Although filet cam with two side salads, to be honest it was the tastiest dish out of all night. The dressing they used was delicious. It made me excited about the steak, but when they brought it, turned out it was a little burned (I ordered medium well) but they must have forgotten about it on a grill because it was almost all well done. The meat was tasteless and hard to chew. No sauce what so ever and no taste.
Brussels sprouts were saggy and not pleasant to eat. On top of all I started getting sick towards the end of the dinner and had to go to bathroom 3 times. Later the same night my boyfriend start experiencing the same problems. So we both got food poisoning on the most romantic night of a year. Very disappointing, very expensive (we spent around $200) for  the result we got.",1.0
"Must state that I have been ordering from this place via seamless for 2 years with no problem, granted that I never had to deal with customer service. I guess that IS the key. As long as you never hv to deal w customer service in this place, then it's all good. I usually order the egg drop soup and chicken with chili and asian green chili pepper. 
Well.
Two days ago (delivery June 19, 2.31 pm), I decided to order completely different main dishes of shredded pork with spicy garlic sauce lunch special, and stir fried baby shrimp w spicy chilli lunch special (along with spicy cucumber salad and panfried yam cake). The delivery guy came fast, but for the first time in the many deliveries, he tried to communicate with me in chinese. My chinese is limited to hi bye thank you sorry, so I know that the first thing he said was ""sorry"", but the rest of his msg wasn't clear - he kept pointing at the food and making eating gestures. He eventually gave up and went away. I did think to call the restaurant to ask what he was trying to say, because that was out of the ordinary, but then decided to think nothing of it. I still hv no idea what the guy said, but maybe it had something to do with the food not being edible, or something, because after I ate my late lunch, I was down with food poisoning the whole day, spending most of my day in the bathroom regurgitating everything I had from lunch and anything else I tried to put back in my system.p afterwards. My sister had the runs too for the whole day. Food poisoning galore, I suspect the shrimp to be the culprit.
Since I know of szechuan palace's customer service rep, I decided to email seamless the next day via email and not contact the restaurant directly when I was slightly better after consuming copious amount of carbons. 
Today I received an email from seamless saying that I should contact the restaurant myself. Oookayyy...
So I did. And as you can read from the other negative reviews below, the woman answering the phone was beyond RUDE, unhelpful, accusatory, and obviously had no clue what customer service or even common courtesy means. I told her that the food I ordered made me sick, and she asked when I ordered. I said two days ago, and i provided her with the order confirmation number. She then basically told me that I should've called the same day (I said I was too sick to do so, and did not think to document my puke either. In fact I immediately threw away everything I ordered, $40 worth). Then she proceded to say combatively over and over again that she did not understand when I ordered (I said two days ago and I gave the date, upon which she replied ""well you tell me two days ago when tuesday wednesday monday??"" -- i did not realize that a particular date can have the possibility of being tues wedn or monday, but anyway...) and she said that I shouldve just called the same day (""you say you sick why you not call same day?"" Errr maybe because I was too busy puking out the content of my stomach?), and ""what you want now?? Cannot help you cannot find order"" (despite me hvng provided the exact order conf number).
Alright then. I wanted none of that crap from her so I just said I will just call seamless again (""yaya go call!"" Truly a pleasant charming woman, that).
So seamless was sympathetic and called the restaurant aka her on my behalf (same result as my call, same woman answered). She said this time (seamless told me) that the owner of the restaurant will call me tomorrow. Well. We will see what happens. All I wanted was for them to take responsibility for their bad, spoilt food, esp considering I have been a customer for close to two yrs. But what they gave me was absolute irresponsible crap. 
So will I ever order from them again? Hell no! If they had better customer service, considering past records, I would prob order again (not the seafood). But because of that sorry excuse of a woman they trust to be the frontline of their customer service? Yea... No thanks.",1.0

"I really wanted to like this place. The owner is a gem and the staff are all very pleasant. The food is just incredibly baffling. We dined here twice; the first time was very unimpressive and but we decided to give it another shot - hey, maybe the place was having a bad night? Second time around, I ordered the stuffed filet of sole and my SO ordered a pasta special; meatballs and gnocchi-like pasta. The flavors in the pasta special were severely lacking and my filet of sole was incredibly fishy and salty. Unsurprisingly, we both got food poisoning and spent the next 12 hours expunging our systems of this meal. We ordered different entrees both visits and both times were really quite terrible.

I am a very big fan of the growing Astoria dining scene and I just cannot bring myself to try this place a third time.",1.0
"Beware! I went here this past Sunday and got HORRENDOUS FOOD POISONING! My fiance and I shared fried clams and each had a lobster roll. About thirty minutes after eating the clams, I became extremely nauseous and anxious. My heart started pounding and I was having a hard time breathing. The symptoms got progressively worst, and I became really ""out of it"" and actually started hallucinating! I had to ask my fiance where I was because I couldn't remember if I was in New York. On top of not knowing where I was/what was going on, it felt like I was having a heart attack because my heart was beating so fast and my chest hurt. Luckily, I made it home before I got sick. This place completely ruined my labor day weekend! I ended up having to consult with a doctor. It was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me! My fiance got sick too shortly after eating the clams. He was also really out of it, and was sweating profusely through his shirt. He did not end up getting as sick as I did. Our symptoms all fall into shellfish poisoning. The worst part was that when I contacted the restaurant to alert them that I got food poisoning, the person I spoke to could care less and simply said, ""Sorry, we haven't received any other reports."" This completely ruined my visit to NYC.  I filed a complaint with the NY Health Dept.",1.0

"This diner is convenient, usually relatively friendly, and serves great fries. But my husband got food poisoning there - bad tummy, felt ill for a day, etc - and I should have taken that as a warning. But I did not.

Last week I ordered a bison burger. The next day, I was as sick as I have ever been. I lost three full days of work. And 6 pounds. I have never ever been so nauseated. I had chills (but no fever) that were ferocious. I literally could not eat, could not move, could not get warm, could not drink even water. It was beyond miserable, and it seemed to take forever to go away. I should probably have gone to the ER - except I could not move. 

You have been warned. I wish I had taken the hint when my husband got what we now know was mild food poisoning. Don't go to this diner. It's like playing roulette. You might be ok - or you might get awfully ill. I would not wish what I had on anyone.",1.0

"So after posting a 2 star review of this place almost 2 years ago, I've been back twice. The first time back I actually liked it so my wife and I returned this Saturday 4/25 and we both got horrible FOOD POISONING!

We shared a dozen oysters and we each had a cheeseburger and some fries. About 4 hours later, we were both woken out of our sleep by the need to vomit. We spent the rest of the night with 100* fevers running back and forth from the bathroom to the bed to either vomit or have diarrhea. This continued all throughout the next day, Sunday 4/26.

It is now 4/27 and while the fever and vomiting is gone, we're both completely exhausted from the ordeal and still contending with diarrhea and had to stay home from work. 

Clearly, either the oysters were bad, the meat was bad, and/or someone in the kitchen needs to brush up on their food handling skills. 

Yes, I'm sure that we were poisoned at Alameda....we didn't consume anything but water after eating there.

I'm not saying never go to Alameda, but eater beware! You can be poisoned anywhere!

I notified the NYC Department of health and apparently they will be looking into the matter. Within 14 days, I'll have an update as to their findings which I will post here.",1.0

"My first experience at Gato was amazing so when my boyfriend asked where I wanted to go for my birthday, I chose Gato without hesitation. We dined there a few nights ago to celebrate.
 
The meal was great. We split a bottle of red wine, two appetizers, two entrees, a side and a dessert. I order the prawn, and I noticed that my last bite seemed to be a bit fishy. However, I didn't think much of it since it was my final bite and everything else tasted amazing.
 
On our way home, my boyfriend got sick. We both thought it was odd but brushed it off. Later that night, I woke up at 2:00am violently ill. 48 hours later, I am still ill and missed a day of work. I was unable to keep anything in my stomach for 36 hours. Since my boyfriend and I did not consume any of the same food this week, and our symptoms clearly indicated that we had food poisoning, we knew we got sick from Gato.
 
If we did not spend $240 on dinner, I would not have brought it to the restaurant's attention. However, not only was my birthday ruined, we essentially paid $240 to throw up for 1.5 days. We spoke to the manager who essentially said that it was not their fault and if we wanted to dine with them again, we should reach out directly to her.

"Me and my boyfriend both got food poisoning after shopping in this store. First we were impressed how nice and clean the store looked. He bought some precooked meal, I bought fruits and vegetables with juice. Both juice and avocado tasted really strange. Few hours later I was in the bathroom with severe food poisoning. And my boyfriend had diarrhea and stomach cramps after eating their meal. We both had to miss out on 3 days from our lives suffering home in bed. Not sure what was that? They need to check out all their food, feels like wait her someone sick working their was touching the food or it all was expired",1.0
"Food poisoning!!! Ordered food Sunday night June 21 2015 and within half an hour both my husband and i started feeling nausea.  Within an hour i started getting stomach cramps and the urge to vomit and then my husband started about 20 min after. We spent the entire night vomiting and diahhrea.  Every half an hour we were in the bathroom. By the morning we were still sick and so weak we had to go to er.  So dehydrated i needed two ivs and still felt sick the entire day!!! Less vomiting but fever and nausea and aches.  Day two and still recovering! Muscles so sore from all that vomiting and diahhrea.

The worst is that this is not the first time we got sick from calexico! Twice last year we ended up with diahhrea but assumed it could have been anything. Didn't order for awhile and then started to again. But we noticed the last few months the quality had been going down. I called the restaurant about 130am bc i was so mad we got sick again and this time it was severe food poisoning!  The manager Phil called me the next evening as promised. We had just returned from hospital and were still laying sick in bed.  I expected at least a refund of our meal.  No refund offered... They offered us a free dinner!  I can't even think of their food without feeling sick... Why would i want to come back?  I can't believe our meal was not even refunded!!! 

They also claimed no liability since we couldn't prove it was their food.  We ate just bagels earlier that day and then ordered calexico in the evening. If we both started feeling symptoms half an hour after eating it's clear what we got sick from.  And we've had diarrhea from calexico before.  Just a coincidence? I don't think so.",1.0
"I  hadn't been to Katz's in about 15 years. I remember it was tasty and expensive but two could share one huge sandwich. Last week my cousin came in from California and made special plans to go to Katz's. We met and it was a mob scene, not surprising since it's about the only Jewish deli left in Manhattan. When we finally sat down, he and my husband got a pastrami on rye. My reuben was ok but nothing special, I've enjoyed them better at diners. My husband and cousin who are both deli connoisseurs were extremely disappointed by their cold tasteless pastrami on rye. Afterwards they both felt queasy. My husband recovered from his food but not from the bill--over $80 with a tip added in on top of the undeserved $10 I'd already left for the waiter. My poor cousin who had to leave for L.A. the next morning got food poisoning and missed work.
Don't believe the hype. With no real competitor, Katz's is comfortable with poor service and quality and inflated prices.",1.0
"I ordered swordfish tacos and my husband ordered the 5 burros quesadilla. We both ended up sick shortly after and were throwing up all the next day. We shared both dishes and it seems to me that the swordfish must have been bad. Our whole weekend was ruined because of food poisoning. Also, the place is always crowded and loud. We will not be back!",1.0
"My boyfriend and I ordered the Mock Duck salad, which tasted alright; however, we quickly noticed that it wasn't much of a salad as it was a collection of leftover vegetable edges and lettuce stalks. The seitan mock duck is delicious though, as is the sauce. What warrants this 1-star review, however, is the fact that my boyfriend and I BOTH got food poisoning at the exact same time the next day. Not like a little bit of diarrhea here, a bit of nausea there;  I'm talking full blown ""projectile vomiting curl in the corner of the bathroom floor crying"" kind of food poisoning. I'm not even exaggerating- I was out of work for 4 days after eating at this place; the chef must've made this salad with ebola, because we were fucking floored from whatever bacteria made its way into our food. Absolutely hideous; which is a shame, because their food is usually decent. Not worth the risk, though- I never want to experience illness like that again.",1.0
"I got food poisoning here over the weekend. I went in for brunch and although I'd been before (just for drinks downstairs). I had eggs, smoked salmon and avocado around 2:30pm on Saturday afternoon. Just before midnight from Sunday into Monday I got violently ill, I threw up nine times and almost went to the emergency room because it got so bad. On Tuesday when I had pretty much recovered, I heard from the three other people I went out to brunch with they got sick too. We all got sick.

Update March 27- despite the unfortunate situation, both the owner and manager did reach out and were very apologetic.",1.0

She was far sicker than me and vomiting the whole next day. Luckily I was able to get through work the next day. I have been eating sushi for decades and have never gotten sick. I called to tell them we got sick and they just said sorry it is raw fish. Absolutely can not go back again. Even a little afraid to eat any sushi again.,1.0
"E-COLI WARNING.

2 days after eating here with my family my father and I were both very sick for over a week. We figured it was from another meal we had the next day, but today we got a call from the NYC department of health that there was an E-Coli outbreak in the kitchen. 

The food is also way overpriced and the manager was extremely rude. For this price you can have a way better meal in the city.",1.0
"Just want to follow up and say that the ""bloating"" I referenced in my initial review were the initial signs of food poisoning. 

Not to make it too graphic for the rest of Yelp but I was really REALLY bloated night of the dinner...followed by an intense morning of bowel trouble and other unspeakables...caused by none other than this joint since I only order from the same 2-3 lunch places every day for work and breakfast. 

My stomach was not very happy after this meal.",1.0
"DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT FOOD POISONING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My fiance and I both ordered a well-done burger and ended up getting food poisoning 8 hours later. This was the worst pain I've ever felt in my life!!! I was sick for 4 days and missed work and almost ended up in the hospital. The meat was contaminated!!!!!!! I know for a fact that I got food poisoning from here because I vomited a piece of pink meat that my stomach could not digest and I did not eat anything earlier that day.

I spoke to the manager and he didn't give a damn! He offered to give us 2 free burgers on the house. Why the hell would I EVER want to eat another burger here when it got us sick in the first place?!!!!!!! Why the hell would I ever wanna eat there after everything we've been through?!!! I don't care about the money. It's the principle! He didn't even apologize, but instead acted like he didn't give a damn. It's disgusting how these people only want your money!


I WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER EAT HERE AGAIN!!! This is for your own safety. Do not eat here! Food poisoning is the worst! The food is not fresh. These people do not care about your safety, they only want your money! They have been reported before. Do your research! 

 I would've rather went to McDonald's and ate fast food than to have had this happen! I spent over $50 here and ended up with the worst pain in my life! If I would've just went to McDonald's and spent $10, I would've been fine. It just goes to show you how these people have no morals or care for their customers. For your own safety, avoid this place and to everyone else who got sick here, make sure you report it to 311 so they can investigate this dirty place!",1.0

"I got sick after eating in Shogun.

Went there on Saturday, the waiter told me it's $2 more in weekends. The food was ok but I was disappointed because they don't have sashimi, Uni and mussels for lunch.

When we all started feeling better, we decided to contact the manager about this incident. And he asked us if we really felt sick from eating their food.  They do not want take responsibility and want to push the blame on us. Today my friend's baby started vomiting.

"I wish I could say the insurmountable service could make up for the bad food but honestly, it can't. 

Hariri soup - overly brothy with barely any chickpeas. The salad had no flavor and the tomatoes were not fresh at all, and it was overly coated in oil. And the snapper was in much too much broth to be enjoyed. My friend had the chicken tagine and she said there was barely any chicken, mostly chunks of fat. The bread rolls were the only yummy thing and even the olive tapenade was missing flavor. The baklava dessert was a good portion but didn't make up for much. 

I couldn't stand the food and left feeling sick. I understand it's a hot spot so I would go back for the night life but definitely not for the food!",1.0
"I ate here yesterday afternoon, ~ 3PM 07/18/2014.

This is my first Yelp review.

The food was so bad I left after some edame beans 1.5 dumplings and 0.5 of the meat from a pork bun.

Something was wrong with the meat, it tasted wrong, hard to describe but 1 mouthful of the dumplings made me feel sick.

Onto the pork bun, first off it looked terrible, with some sort of plasticy bun but I don't normally eat the bun so didn't taste it. Whatever they had done to the meat... humans just shouldn't eat that.

The edame beans were dry and way too salty.

After the meal I went into one of the restaurants next door and asked to use their restroom. All I could get up was half a dumpling, still it's better than nothing.


Maybe it's an outlier but why take the risk, there are plenty of 4/5 star places in Manhatten that don't make you feel sick.",1.0
"So I have been here before..I was very pleased with my first visit..so pleased I made my very first yelp review to praise them.  So when my sisters birthday came near, I said they have to try this place. My mother started with the spinach salad (which I had the first time I came here) , and I highly recommended it to her. But when the salad came, it was so severely over dressed with the pomegranate dressing, to the point of not being edible. I ordered the hanger steak, which was just OK, it was only 4 small slices of steak (not enough for $23) my sister ordered shepards pie, which the meat wasn't even seasoned. She ordered a jack Daniels and ginger ale , she also had half a dozen oysters. The drink was sooo strong it wasn't even drinkable, when we told the manager she didn't even ask to make another, just kinda shrugged her shoulders like ""oh well"". so then my sister became very sick, even went to the bathroom to throw up. We asked the manger where do they get the oysters, she said they get them In Everyday, we also mentioned again that the drink was very very strong, she was very unaccommidating, as a manager when you see someone is not feeling well or unhappy, you would try to make it right. She almost patronized my sister about it, as if she ate something before we got here, even started telling a ridiculous story about her grandmother, (almost trying to deter away from the issue we were having) rather than making her feel comfortable. I didn't come here to hear about your grandmother, I cam here for good food and good service , and I got neither. I work in Manhattan for one of the finest food critics, and have dined at the best. I have never had an experience like this before. I felt embarrassed that I even recommended this place. I will be sure to tell the people I know (the foodies in the area and in manhattan) as well as my boss about my experience here. I know a lot of people in the food and restaurant industry. I will be sure they don't waste their time and. money here. Customer service is everything to me. That's the thing, when your a manager, you should always be on your A-game, because you never know who's who. I guess we didn't look important enough. Even if the food was $5 , it still wouldn't be worth it. I will never come back to this place. Terribly disappointed. Wish I can give no stars.",1.0
"As much as I WANT to like this place bc it's close and convenient and actually seems very clean, it has made me sick TWICE.

First time I didn't make the connection - thought I had just caught a bug - didn't think it was the food. But, after giving it a second shot months later, now I know. I ate simple appetizers only: The seaweed salad and the shrimp spring roll. Seaweed salad did NOT go over well. Those salads sit in the case up front, and I'm now wondering how long they sit there.. Sorry to say I Definitely won't be eating here again.",1.0
"This place is totally gimmicks ! Since the Lady owner/cook took over, You can't expect anything fresh here. I eat indian food oftenly that's why I know all about it simply. One afternoon I went, Chana masala was there on the Buffet ( Beware: Even though they call it Buffet; it's not real Buffet. It's just the one time portion platter of Old foods! ) Since it was horrible, I went back to see what other good stuff they might have instead, I found she had already recycled that chana masala into spinach to give the impression of  New chana saag which I realized only after I felt sick. Poor myself, I didn't learn lesson after my first attempt. But I decided to expose this place's sinful practice committed by it's Lady owner/ cook so that other won't suffer the way I did.
They have almost everything repeated everyday.
Just in case if you find anything new item, it might be the leftover from other day.
So much so, I found The lady was touching cooked cabbage with her bare hand  !  How could she do that???
I got the endless pain from this place which used to be good years back under different ownership as per my friend who recommended me this place while ago ( most likely before current ownership).

DEAR TOURISTS: DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE HOSPITAL YOUR NEXT TRIP.

All I can say , this place is a open fraud. Do not  fall on their trap ( The Lady Owner/ Cook's). She thinks she is smart to make customers foolish but the reality is : Regular customers are smarter than her !

Conclusion : This place worth is less than a food cart !",1.0
"I feel bad giving this place two stars because we saw David Chang on Mind of a Chef, and I wanted to love this place. First of all, the service in here was AWFUL. It was very busy, but we waited almost 40 minutes to get our shitake bun, which was like an appetizer, and then an additional 20 to get our 3 bowls of ramen. We were watching people who came in after us get their buns and food well before we did, but I have learned not to mess with the people that make your food, so I didn't say anything. I ordered the hozon noodle bowl (which was delicious), and a few hours later, I was sick. I don't know what ingredient in that dish could have made me sick, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Despite the fact that the shitake bun was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, I would never go back here.",1.0
"a last minute decision to stop in and try s'mac, a place i've been wanting to try because of all the good things i've heard from my friends

they have a good amount of recommended macs and cheese combinations that definitely sound interesting - buffalo chicken, masala etc

you can also order your mac and cheeses with multi-grain or gluten free pasta, a nice touch if you have dietary requirements

if you don't like any of the recommendations, you can let your creative culinary taste loose and make your own

there was a decent amount of beers on tap here and bottled beer - mostly craft beers which is bonus points in my book as i prefer this then your typical brands such as coors light

i opted to order the regular 4 cheese dish thinking ""hey this place is known for mac and cheese (hence the name of the place) so their basic dish should be awesome"" - this is where it went downhill for me

a lot more cheese in this then i like, at some point it felt like i was just eating melted cheese and no mac - don't get me wrong, i like cheese a lot but not in a liquid form in this big of an amount

the high point of my meal was my beer, ommegang witte - a light, easy drinking beer

i really wanted to like this place and walked in with high hopes, but left disappointed and bit sick from all the cheese and not enough mac",1.0
"Service is always attentive. Not first visit so I expected superior food and flavors. Oysters were fresh with bland mango sauce. Bread was scorched black on the bottom (place was empty, no excuse). Worst of all, a cold and undercooked piece of salmon revealed a tapeworm wiggling around. UCH! My daughter was pressured to reorder something else. GO AWAY!! She was about to lose it on the table. Our waiter was very nice, but the night manager charged me for my dinner...even though I ate some of the salmon. To avoid a scene, I paid and then called back. They agreed, we should not have been charged for our dinner.  
We barely made it to our show we felt so sick. We saw salmon continue being served even though they told me they butchered another fish....what do you think? Unless they cut one up in under two minutes and cooked it...uch again!

"I came here with a group of 15 people for lunch a while back. We made a reservation but had to wait 20 minutes for them to set up the tables since it was a large group, which was understandable. I tried several things and am speaking from my experience. With Ichi Umi, you're really just getting variety, price, and quantity over quality. Everything is usually a hit or miss, and even then, it is pretty mediocre. The yakisoba and crab soup were delicious. Tuna sashimi was also okay, but I can't speak for the rest of the sushi since I didn't try any. The jeon, or Korean pancakes, were too soggy and oily, which happens when it's left out for too long. There's also the dumplings which are just off from the ice cream fridge (didn't make sense to me), which are quite small and also very dry. The ice cream however, is amazing and so, so creamy.

This is where it went downhill for me. Ganjang gejang. This is a dish I've been wanting to try for so long, and when I saw it sitting on that fateful platter, I couldn't wait to try it. Ganjang gejang is a Korean dish with fermented crabs in soy sauce. I sit down and take my first bite, and I immediately taste regret. It was so fishy, so sour, and smelled so bad that I retched and felt sick the entire day. At first, I thought that maybe this was an acquired taste that  my taste buds were just too weak for this dish. However, I have now had ganjang gejang from so many different Korean restaurants and loved it, that I know those were not fresh crabs and that was not prepared well. Please spare yourself.",1.0
"I was really looking forward to having a pasta dinner when I got home. This place was disgusting and made me feel sick. I would highly suggest not ordering from here.

"Don't eat here.  I ate here once with my father; we waited for an extremely long time before it became clear they forgot our order.  I've also ordered delivery three times.  The first time, I asked what was on the seafood pizza, and the person on the other line responded with, ""I don't know,"" with no intention of investigating.  When it arrived, it made me sick.  The second time, the person taking my order discovered the credit card machine was out of order in a suspiciously short amount of time, and when my chicken parm arrived it was clearly veal.  The third time I ordered, I asked the guy what ""Margherita D.O.C."" on the menu stood for, and he once again responded with ""I have no idea,"" with no interest in looking into it.  They sent the food to the wrong address and charged four dollars for a ""side salad"" of just lettuce.

And the food is bland.  I repeat: don't give them your business.  The low level of service and quality on every level is astounding.",1.0
"Had the bbq combo with the pork belly and the big seafood casserole pot. If you order the combos or large pots, they will bring it out to cook at your table.

"I was so excited about the new location. I love Bareburger and always stick to ordering the same dishes since there is not much available for a vegetarian. Unfortunately, my black bean burger patty was missing salt and seasoning entirely. When I told the waitress about it (I was being very polite, mind you), she promised to bring me some of there special sauce to make it more tolerable. After taking their sweet time, they bring me an extra dipping sauce - the same one they use for their fries. It didn't make the burger any better. I ended up leaving most of it on the plate and leaving the restaurant hungry. The staff acted like I had no business complaining about my food. I wish they tasted it before acting like they are god's gift to the world. To add insult to injury, they charged me extra for the sauce! I am pretty sure they spit in it, too, because I felt sick afterwards. Never going back there again. I hope they close down. Disgusting.",1.0

"Oh, well!.. Where to start? My BF and I were at this place twice: honest to god - NEVER AGAIN! There are more good restaurants in the area and 1000s more in all of NYC! 
Why did we go there twice you would ask?- because first impression was actually good - the day was bright and sunny, to have brunch outdoors on a crisp fall Saturday morning seemed a great idea - so, why not to try this new, so much talked about, and so much anticipated in the area restaurant. So we got there, set at the outside table - ordered virgin Bloody Mary (nicely balanced and spicy!), grapefruit juice, I got eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and my BF got scrambled eggs with cheddar biscuits and gravy. And both dishes were perfect!! Just yum. And our waitress was nice and helpful. Plus they had a live jazz band! Awesome! So, we were happy and knew we gonna come back for more! - For greater experience, for a delicious dinner and cosy atmosphere! Oh, we were wrong!!!! Jeez..!
Let me tell you, tonight we went back for a dinner and had a horrible! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! So we got the table for two of us inside, waiter came to us shortly after, gave us menus and asked if we want anything to drink - of course I got that virgin Bloody Mary (and yes it was good! And spicy). This time we saw the dinner menu first time (definitely not the most creative one - seems like they just got a bunch of different dishes from the menus of other restaurants together) - nothing striking there. Oh well, we ordered anyways and thought we never could go wrong with the ""staples"": mussels, and shrimp ceviche for starters, and lobster bisque for my main with the side of sautéed spinach, and beef short ribs with bourbon au jus for my BF's main. At first, waiter came back and said the ceviche isn't available. Then about 10 min later mussels arrived. Cold. Room temperature cold. With a piece of stale bread. We asked for some more bread (maybe hoping for the fresh one). Guy, who brought us food, - said he'll bring some more. And he never did. And we asked our waiter and he never brought it either. Ok. So to the taste of those mussels - I found it fair. My BF said he found couple of pieces too fishy (now he is actually sick and had to take medicine to calm his stomach ache). Then.. The entries arrived. in the middle of the first course.. His plate first. Couple of minutes later mine. I found it bizarre. They didn't give us even 10 minutes to enjoy our so-so mussels and now, when my BF is sick, I'm actually thinking thank god we didn't finish them!!! No joke! Ok. To the entries - ribs were ok. Not great but ok. To fatty though. My soup (oh boy!) was not really edible. This lobster bisque had so many pieces of shell in it, it seemed like the poor lobster was mashed with the shell together in the broth! If I'll be able post the pics - check it out for the reference ;) and spinach was extremely garlicky, even for me(!) - who loves garlic in everything, except desert of course :)). To be fair, I had to say, that manager came to Us to ask how we are doing. And when she heard from me that soup is inedible and saw all the pieces of shell, she admitted - it was not a soup it supposed to be! And offered to bring me another bowl. But what the sense?? It still would be the same soup! But she never offered to take it of the check or to buy a drink or desert. None. We had to ask our waiter to take it of the bill since I never ate even a half of it. And he wen to the manager and he did take it of the bill. Thanks. He was apologetic about the our dining experience. 
In the conclusion: 2 courses and 2 very unhappy and feeling sick ppl later, I can say: virgin Bloody Mary is good, decor of the place is nice, Comfy sitting, Many TVs for the sport fans. But Jeez! That food!!! Whoever is in that kitchen - he/she has to learn how to cook! And management! -  please, step up the game! Otherwise this place won't last long no matter how many TVs you have!!!",1.0
I normally buy lunch there since I work in the area.  Today I got physically sick when I bought their cream of broccoli soup.  Took my first two spoons then got disgusted. They were a bit too organic with over 20 bugs in my soup. I called them back immediately telling them what happened and was put on hold.  I had to call back to speak to the manager and I told him that he should remove the soup.  Went back after work and the soup was still there almost empty and again more bugs when I checked.  I was appalled.  I will never go back there just the though of eating bugs is making me sick as I type.  I would have normally given them 4 stars but today just killed it for me.,1.0
"The biggest mistake I have ever made was ordering from here. I woke up, a tad hungover after birthday celebrations, and was craving bubble tea. The only place near me that delivered such a thing was Lemon Life. They also delivered sushi...so I thought... ""why not?!"" Yeah. Stupid, stupid move. I have never been sick from sushi til now. 

The bubble tea, however, was not bad. But the sushi itself tasted old and looked like someone who didn't give a damn prepared it. I stopped eating pretty quickly into it, but still felt the effects. Clearly another year older did not make me another year wiser.

Never again Lemon Life.

"This restaurant is a udon west IZAKAYA, unlike my favorite little hole in the wall on St. Marks. I was in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. 

I was greeted promptly by staff. Sitting at the bar, I ordered agedashi tofu and nabeyaki udon with a sansei udon to go on a drizzling Monday night. The staff was friendly and attentive; the chefs made eye contacts and smiled. The restaurant was half empty and the vibe was inviting. (1 star) The wait staff was not rushed, neither did they make me wait for long to order. (1 star)

They serve the nabeyaki udon first - no biggie except the soup was not rolling boil and the filling was very little. Chicken was not grilled before hand like the other Udon West in St Mark's, and there was no spinach in my nabeyaki udon. The tempura batter on the shrimp was too thick to soak up the soup and fall out. The soup tasted ok. The noodle was satisfactory; not too stiff and definitely not your Chinese grocery udon noodle. (1 star) However, when I finished eating the fish cake, I tasted something funky which reminded me of scaling the fish, and  my stomach started to hurt. 

Then came the agedashi tofu. I like how they laid the tofu flat on a small plate to make it easy to eat with a spoon. However, the sauce was way too sweet with not enough daikon radish and the serving was very small. The sweetness was sickening.

While sitting at the bar, I kept getting my back bumped or slid by wait staff and patrons which was a bit annoying. 

I think I will come back here to try their sashimi and other izakaya item to be fair. I really want to like this place because the staff was very attentive and I was happy with the service. However, the food which made my stomach ache and was seasoned wrong simply does not make sense to return to. Perhaps I was unlucky on a October Monday night.",1.0

I don't really think the fish was fresh, maybe that's what the problem was. I had 15 pieces of random special rolls left on my plate when I was done!

"was craving a warm waffle with vanilla gelato but got let down when they said the kitchen was closed! it's a Sunday and they said the kitchen closes an hour before the store so basically kitchen closes at 9pm and cafe closes at 10pm. womp womp what a sad night for a pregnant woman craving a warm waffle at 9:30pm. 

anyways the workers were really nice and I was still craving something sweet so I went for the tiramisu. it was $5.50 comes in a cute box since I got it to go and it's made in a cute glass bowl which I will be reusing! 

the tiramisu itself was not good, very airy, missing something ... did not enjoy it and will not get it again kinda making me sick feeling right now. 

btw there's a $10 minimum in credit cards. 

I'm coming back for my waffle and gelato!",1.0
"Friends have recommended this place to me so much. Ended up getting the soup dumplings and they were okay. At first, I enjoyed them though they felt a bit one-note, but as I kept eating I started to feel sick. I don't think the pork fat they use in the broth in the soup dumplings is particularly good. Either it was sort of spoiled or it was just too much fat for my tummy (which is ironic because my belly has some fat storage heh), so I won't be coming back.",1.0
"Just returned from lunch hour at Dos Caminos. I feel sick! The food was horrible, wannabe Mexican food with the same flavors throughout all the plates. The guacamole is just that, guacamole.

"The $$ rating is really misleading. Sure, your lunch or dinner can be $10, but that $10 gets you 3 bites of mediocre sweet potato mash.

"I've stopped by here a few times here and there over the years for sandwiches mostly. They are usually pretty good, options are fun and fresh. It's convienent with it's multitude of options. 

Yesterday I was brave and decided to try the udon noodle soup. It's rainy and cold and I thought it would be soothing. I happen to love udon noodle soup and I have tried it at severa locations. I'm all excited to watch him prepare it, all of the fun toppings and then the savory broth. 
I asked for kimchi for .50$. 

First of all, the kimchi was sour but not in a flavorful way, a way that didn't feel fresh. The broth was tastless but overbearingly salty, also a little sour. The udon noodles didn't tast good at all- I don't even know how describe it.

"If I could give this place a 0 star rating I would! It used to be good years ago no more! I went here recently with my dad and my sister (who is in culinary hs in nyc). And we ordered two lobster tails and a filet migon. SENT ALL THREE BACK! We got there at 7! We didn't leave till 9 and no dessert didn't even ask! When we sent the meals back, the lobsters were so rubbery like they were way overdone not to mention the size was so small and dinky (and this is a fish restaurant). The filet migon was gray and so hard and dry it could break glass! The presentation was lifeless and the wait staff was laughing! Honestly when I saw the help wanted sign outside their window I was thrown off and nervous. Because I yelped good lobster tails and this place showed up! I complained and the wait staff didn't seem concerned and didn't take anything off the bill! When I went home I vomited! This place sucks! ITS SO OBVIOUS THEY NEED KITCHEN HELP! Second time round the meals still sucked I should of went to millers! Gross! The waiters said the owner (Larry) was not their unless he was to embarrassed to show his face! I hope he sees this because I ended up getting sick on my birthday night! And nobody compensated anything! Not even a coffee! Cheap. Gross. And not talented chefs! It was a waste of 150!",1.0
"I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews. I ate here for lunch today with a friend. We ordered a regular burger and a turkey burger.  The food took 45 mins - 1 hour to come out (way too long for a hungry lunch time working crowd). My friend's burger was mediocre (at best) and mine made me feel sick. The turkey burger was obviously frozen and tasted like it was mostly filler. I assume they buy them wholesale from the same supplier that prison cafeterias use. My sweet potato fries were hand cut, but so under cooked that the inside was completely raw. They we also poorly seasoned. The lettuce on the burger was browning and mostly white/bitter, as it was from the part next to the bottom core. The tomato had a white/pinkish hue, and 50% of the middle was actually green, as they gave me the top slice by the stem.  They definitely buy the cheapest vegetables possible, and should use better products and charge a little more. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is that our server was friendly. If not for the unsuspecting tourists, this restaurant would go under, or we would see it on an episode of Bar Rescue. Don't waste your time or money going here. There are plenty of other places to choose from in the area.",1.0

My poor brother got the beef with broccoli rabe The meat look like some animal regurgitated it had this gross fatty cartilage to it . The noodles were cheap ramen stuck together. The sweet & sour chicken was such small portion a little kid could eat it and still be hunger. It was just so so tasting nothing great and the rice was dry and stuck together.

"You need to have a UBEr sweet tooth to enjoy the food here. 

BRUNCH review: 
1-Ginger cider: slight taste of ginger, cool they put a big slice of ginger in the drink. 
2- Filipino style eggs Benedict: basically same thing except swapping ham for canned spam-- even the spam was sweeter and did not taste like the brand name spam. The dressing on the salad that came with this dish was even sweet. The home fries were even sweet didn't taste like potato tasted more like sweet Potato. 
3- Tapsilog: marinated beef was extra sweet and salty. Not tender like all the other reviews stated. Only thing really good about this dish was the garlic rice. It came with a pickle tomato and cucumber and red onion.. They were wilted and just not good. 

Ambiance: 
It actually reminds me of a filipino frat house. Loud music all r&b/reggae/dance style-- typically what filipinos like to listen to. very home-y, tight space

Service: 
All young kids mostly filipino, nice...

Seating was uncomfortable and obviously made so you won't stay very long. It seems fresh on the surface but when you look a little closer, it's really not. It was also a bit expensive. I'm not saying i wouldn't go back because it seems they did have some quick and easy offerings.  It's just not as good as Pret a Manger.",1.0
"I went to Ollie's during prime lunch hours, and it was quite busy so it was hard to get service. The dumplings were ok, but I loved all the different options of broth and meat for the noodle bowls.

"I have no idea how this restaurant is so highly rated. My boyfriend and I went here on a whim, because I was craving an arugula salad, and this came up on a search, extremely highly rated and cheap. The wait for a table was about an hour, and we stayed against our better judgment, because the more time passed the more we felt invested. Plus the food coming out of the kitchen looked good. Really, we should have left a lot sooner than we did.

Some points:

1) This place is dirty. Like... actively disgusting. I wish I'd realized the tables weren't cleaned between customers before we waited so long. They were caked with food residue being moved around by the same dirty dishrag that the water/busser was using to wipe down everything. I've never seen anything like it.

There was something floating in my boyfriend's orange juice.

We were told to sit at a table with dirty dishes still on it. The first of the previous table's dirty dishes were cleared away 10 minutes after we'd ordered, but we didn't feel right leaving since the waiter already looked pretty confused about... well, everything. There were dirty drink glasses with lipstick on them after I got my entree.

The food was being prepped behind the counter on a nightstand. Customers actually walked through the kitchen on the way to the bathroom. The owner handled cash and went right back to handling food.

2) Everything took forever. We ordered all of our food (including orange juice for my boyfriend) at once when we sat down. The wait for a table is one thing, but we didn't get water 'til about 15 minutes after our order was taken, and it was at least another 10 before the orange juice came, and the dirty dishes from the last patrons at the table STILL weren't gone. My entree came at least 10 minutes or more before any of my boyfriend's food came out.

3) The owner/chef has a very abrasive personality. After hearing the owner very passive aggressively telling some other guys ""Sure, if you want to waste my time,"" for asking her to split a bill onto two credit cards, we got to the front of the line the people behind us sat down at a table with dirty dishes still on it before us and the chef/owner (??) yelled at them. And then she turned to us and told us that if we wanted not to be taken advantage of we should run to the table and let them clear the plates off it afterward. I've never heard of a rule like that. Sitting with other people's dirty dishes is GROSS. 

4) The food wasn't great. My boyfriend's orange juice had something floating in it. He ordered the potatoes, tomato sauce and parmesan and got potatoes and meatballs in tomato sauce, which didn't get sent back because we didn't have the time or patience to deal with it, we just wanted to leave. It was lukewarm. He ordered a tomato/mozarella/basil panini and it was cold, the cheese wasn't melted, and the bread was partially blackened, yet it was also somehow soggy on the inside. The garlic bread was partially room temperature and partially cold. Some pieces were stale. My arugula salad was greasy, but okay, but then I felt sick a couple of hours later.

5) The place was extremely disorganized. After getting a table, we were asked to move to another table, and the waiter was apparently not updated on our seating change because he tried to take our order again (poor guy). The same guy busing tables was taking order and running orders to tables and he was clearly extremely confused.

Overall, it was a cheap place to eat, so we didn't lose anything but time and some tums, but there are loads of clean, tasty places in the area where you can get a good panini or salad that are only a few bucks more. I would never come here again or recommend it, but it was quite the experience, and at least I have newfound perspective on what a one-star restaurant is?",1.0
"The first time I came here, I got an everything bagel with olive tofu cream cheese.  It was pretty good, and I really liked the fact that they had olive tofu cream cheese, which many places do not.  The second time I came, they no longer had the olive tofu cream cheese, so I got the veggie tofu cream cheese with an everything bagel instead.  It was pretty good, but it made me very sick.  I do not think I will be coming back here.  It is expensive, the lines are long, and I do not want to get sick again.  There are many other bagel places that are comparable in taste (and where toasting your bagel is an option).",1.0
"I became a big fan of Pastrami sandwich since I had it first time at the Met's Citi field(It was $11 even stadium price)

I probabry made a wrong choice...I orderd Corned beef sandwich instead of Pastrami somehow I wanted to try something I never had before.

Every time I've called to speak to their manager I get a BS response like ""oh I'm so sorry, he just stepped out"" and then when I tell them what's wrong with the order they try to convince me that I'm mistaken some how and that this is the way it was supposed to be.

"Overall word for this place - GROSS!

I fell in love with this place a little over 2 years ago, and came back a few times.. But it sort of fell of my radar for a while ( a year) until last week a friend and I decided to catch up with each other.. and our love affair with this place. I remember it having GREAT drinks, awesome reasonably priced food and a great decor. 

Coming back, this have CHANGED, now first thing was.. no more communal tables ( which was great) the decor was still nice.. and those two things are what I dedicate my only star too.

Now the drinks: SUGAR. I like a nice well mixed cocktail, and I understand that entails ( a lot of times) sugar additives.. but the mojitos I got here, were almost sickly sweet, and didnt taste cool or refreshing at all. 

Then it was time to order .. i told the waitress specifically that I.DO.NOT.EAT.MEAT.. but I do eat fish..... and I looked at the dumplings which said ""Chicken or Shrimp"" and told her that we would have the shrimp dumpling steamed. Low and behold our appetizer comes out, I bite in, and its chicken. Call the waitress over, and she explains its ""chicken AND shrimp."" You couldn't tell me that before I ordered it? When I specifically told you I don't eat chicken? 

So at this point I realize they have changed chefs, or the menu...since I specifically remember loving their steamed shrimp dumplings.

next, I order steamed sea bass with vegetables. The pieces of sea bass is tiny, and half of it is a nasty layer of fatty skin, which i bite into, and gag. The plate overall is very saturated in grease and unpleasant. The tiny piece of fish is tasteless. 

I had a stomach ache the next day. I will not be coming back, sad. It was actually pretty great once.",1.0

"Later the same night....the mystery spinach artichoke dip made me sick :( . Subtracting a star.

Earlier in the night....
The reasons for the four stars is because:
- I love the bar in the back which is quieter and conducive to talking, the bar upfront is louder
- the decor is a surprise, it's cozy and rustic
- happy hour runs til 8pm!
I'd go back for the happy hour!

I'd give the food 3 stars.  I wasn't crazy about the food. The calamari was delish but the spinach artichoke dip was more a mystery dip made of I don't know what with what amounts to spinach garnish. It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste like  spinach artichoke dip either. I then had one of the specials, the chicken pot pie which was bland and light on the filling. The donut hole dessert was generous and the best part of the meal. You get five donut holes which aren't greasy and dusted with sugar, filled with cream and served with a berry sauce.",1.0
"It's been 24 hours after I ate at Va Bene and I still feel sick. I looked up the menu online and based on its high prices, I was expecting much better food. While the restaurant is nice and quant, its food is far below par! I was there with a group of my friends and we all ordered different things to try out, as it was our first time trying the restaurant. We started with pizzas as an appetizers, and while I enjoyed the grilled crust, the sauce had absolutely no flavor and I found myself dumping mounds of salt just to taste something. The cheese they use was also very heavy, not typical mozzarella. For dinner, we ordered a variety of different pasta dishes, salads and a fish dish. The salmon was very smelly so I did not try it. The salads were nothing special, and much too small for the $20 price tag! I was impressed with how the pasta dishes looked, but that's where my positive notes end on the pasta. I ordered the mushroom tortallini with alfredo sauce. It was ""ehh."" The mushroom filling didn't taste like anything. It's only saving grace was the alfredo sauce. I did not finish the pasta, and dipped the bread from the bread basket in the sauce instead. DO NOT ORDER the penne with creamy tomato sauce (there is barely any sauce and the sauce once again has no flavor). I had heart burn and felt nauseous during the dinner. As soon as we left the restaurant, we went to the convenience store next door for ginger ale and tums.

"It's your typical Applebees.

Nothing special and it is not culturally diverse, only seeming to revolve around African Americans.

All the waiters and servers are about 20-25 years old and they look as if they do not like their job.

The walk here is disgusting, after getting off the bus, you literally have to walk a mile to get to this location and the only reason why I come is here because of their 2 for $20 or $26 combos but even that may not be good enough of a reason for me to eat at Applebees again. 
I didn't have a bad experience, but every time I eat at Applebees I get a migraine and I feel sick. The last time I ate at Applebees, the food seem and tasted like it had been cooked and left out for 20 mins before it was served to me, it was barely warm and it was gross. Secondly, I ordered a raspberry ice tea and it tasted like artificial raspberry, a little over-the-counter cough medicine and 1 quart of sugar. It was bad and for $3, it's NOT worth it.

I didn't send it back because I was on a grouper date I wanted to escape asap.

"I've had family in this neighborhood and lived here myself a few years ago, so it caught my eye when this place opened up and pioneered a trend of similar cafes and niche restaurants here. I finally had a chance to try it, and unfortunately I see why it has such a mediocre rating. 

The staff was pleasant enough, but the lady taking my order didn't seem familiar with the (short) menu and what they offered at all. The wait time was acceptable but the Mos Definitely was not what I expected at all as far as the gravy was concerned (it was much more like beanless chili con carne then biscuit gravy). Again, rolling with the punches, I ate it anyway. The cucumber lemonade was fantastic, though. I had planned on having a coffee or another lemonade and enjoying the quaint vibe, but about 10 min after sitting down, they turned up some top 40 radio. Another 10 min after that, I felt distinctly queasy and as they have no restroom for patrons, hurried home to be sick. I can't say for certain if it was specifically due to the food here, but it's the only suspect, and I'm not inclined to give Dahlia's another chance in the future. Oh well.",1.0
Went during lunch and got their pad Thai lunch special with spring rolls and salad. It was about $11 and half the portion you pay. They filled the containers only half way.

"I really don't understand the hype at Carbone. I have been three times. The first time I went was during the first month they opened. I got deathly sick in the middle of the night from their dinner.

I come from a very traditional italian family and i was soooo disappointed in Carbone's sauce. To me it tasted a bit sour. They needed to take the bitterness out of the tomato's.  The third time was this past Saturday evening. We had an 8:30 reso, sat at 9:45. Didn't offer a cocktail, dessert or anything in between.

"First of all the hot food is delicious. The burgers are really good. So that's a star. This place is overpriced and disgusting though.  The breakfast sandwiches are gross. It never fails. Every time I eat at this place I get sick or i find something in my food. I would not recommend you to come here.
Once I ordered a vanilla latte and they gave me hot chocolate and when I tried to switch it the cashier almost made a big scene about it. Also this place has over charged me for items many times. If you order from here ALWAYS ask for your receipt back even though they do not itemize which makes it easy for them to take advantage of you.  Don't bother coming here.  Try Al's across the street.",1.0
"I have tried this place twice.  I love the idea it - the look of it - the fact that the neighborhood needs it so I wanted it to be great.  I ordered the  falafel plate with 2 salad sides to go. I got home, ate it and was seriously sick most of the night.  This was rough and not to mention the food was BLAND, very overdone and a bit of a one note.  Everything tasted the same.  

The other time I went there was for a smoothie.  Peanut butter, cinnamon and banana.
It was over $7 dollars and they used JIF peanut butter - it was super sugary and gross.

This place looks great but the product is not.

They have this sign out front that says -

""Don't feel awful, have a falafel""  It reminds me of how sick I got after trying their falafel.  I did feel awful :P",1.0

"I'll admit, I've never had Georgian food before. That's why I came here, really. That said, if this is indicative of the nation's cuisine, I don't expect to try it again. I don't even expect to eat the leftovers I doggy-bagged. The food was salty beyond compare. It's the sulguni cheese, which is conspicuously abundant in most vegetarian options.

I ordered the Imeruli Khachapuri (one of the eight heavily stuffed pieces was more than enough food for one meal) and the Soko Ketsze (cheese-stuffed button mushrooms). It came with bread, which I assume was to mop up the 10 tbs of grease that poured off each stuffed mushrooms, of which I ate two before I promptly died of a clogged artery.

I sat in the outdoor area, which was sporadically lit. As in, the lights would turn on and off at random intervals. And halfway through our appetizer, the restaurant turned on industrial-strength fans to contribute to the surreal ambiance. 

Credit where it's due, what a beautiful place.

UPDATE: I ate the leftovers, and now I feel sick.",1.0

Vincente  destroyed it all, nothing left except the empty smelly containers.When he was done he said it was so so. I personally can not recommend this joint.

"I want to love the Mill Basin Deli, really I do. But I can't. The last time we were here I was unhappy but hoped it was just an aberration, just a bad day for them and not representative of overall poor quality.  Ten, fifteen years ago we went often and enjoyed it.  But not now.  We won't be back.
We went on Father's Day and were actually shocked that it wasn't crowded.  That might have been a tip-off.  We were seated in the new back room.  The acoustics (ultra high ceiling) are so awful that you can barely hear over the din, even the din of a less-than-half-full room. I was unable to hear people at my own table clearly.
At the outset, one of our table asked for water but instead of bringing water for all of us, only one glass appeared.
I ordered an iced tea and it came with a couple of melting ice cubes that melted completely within a few minutes, leaving the drink tepid.  No lemon and no sweetener was provided and I had to ask for sweetener twice -- once from the busboy who said yes and never returned and then from the waitress.  I had to use ice cubes from a companion's water to make the tea drinkable. The waitress kept disappearing.
Two of us ordered soup.  Mine, the cabbage soup, came to the table at room temperature.  The kreplach soup was warmer but hot it definitely wasn't.  I sent back the soup and it did come back hot.
We ordered appetizers of pigs in a blanket (the serving size was ridiculously small for the price) and latke chips which were also not very hot and some were burnt.  The apple sauce was brought afterward in a tiny bowl that was insufficient for the amount of chips.
The sandwich was nothing special, the hot dogs seemed like they must have been on the grill all day long, the knish old tasting as well.
The two of us who had soup got sick to our stomachs that night.  The others did not and I suspect the soups were not hot enough to kill off any organisms.
The service was poor and, be warned, you can not add the tip to your credit card bill, forcing us to scramble for cash.  
The last time we were here, maybe 6 months ago, everything was terribly bland, lacking salt and spice.  This time things were not as bland but equally disappointing. And the prices, considering the poor quality, are absurd. 
What a shame that one of the last Jewish delis in the area has fallen so far.",1.0
"I think the yelpers who wrote the good reviews must not have ever had Indian cuisine or perhaps they haven't tried other restaurants in the area. Or maybe they were sick and did not have all their taste buds in tact. OR, they were dying of starvation for days so that this crap tasted great.

Want to read the short version of this review? DO NOT ENTER HERE.

Where do I begin?

For starters, I have an open mind to trying new food, and dine frequently in many places all over New York City. I am not quick to bash any restaurant. But this one deserves the utmost terrible review, and I feel it would be unjust if I did not warn others about this place.

Dhaba, your $12 lunch buffet was not even worth the measley 12 bucks, and you can bet I will be telling my colleagues and friends to stay the hell away.

I was APPALLED:

1) Egg Biryani- the rice was not cooked!!!!! Hard pieces of rice, really? I could feel the hard texture in my mouth!

2) Basmati rice- very DRY!

3) Dessert- only one choice, really? So I thought, this was a terrible meal, at least the (pathedic) one choice of dessert will save it. NOPE! I didn't think it was possible to mess up on Gulab Jamun, in my 25  years on Earth I have never had a bad piece of Gulab Juman. You guys really screwed up! It tasted as if I tried to make it at home, and for the first time. 

4) Lamb curry- tasted OK. This was the only item that was average. (Yes, at best, average)

5) Aloo Saag- very bland Spinach dish. You guys just added potato to it! There was NO flavor.

The ONLY thing I enjoyed was the Naan bread- too bad this couldn't be my meal! I had to try to eat 3 pieces so that I could be at least somewhat full.

This place is ridiculously terrible. I was really, really shocked. Why take a chance with this one when there are other restaurants on the same street? I could tell that the other few groups that were dining there looked like tourists as if they had unknowingly stumbled in, also tricked into thinking it would taste fine.

Want to know the ending to this horrifying story? It is 3 hours later and my stomach is still feeling queasy.

Conclusion: STAY AWAY. They do not deserve business if they cannot offer quality food.",1.0
Last monday i had a spinach omlet for lunch. It was pretty good. By that afternoon i was so sick. I was in the bathroom all night.... i didnt have any thing else that day so it had to be this place....I doubt very seriously that will eat here again,1.0
"The reviews looked great so we stopped by for lunch. We ordered the miso ramen and it was just okay. Nothing special at all. It looks like they reuse unused broth from the day prior in their ""freshly"" made broth. (Maybe that contributed to their ""B"" heath grade rating) Unfortunately, it made me really sick :( 

Don't expect a seat if you're with more than 1 other person. The service was decent, but I don't recommend this location if you're even slightly claustrophobic.",1.0
"This review, Bryant Park Café, is like rain on your wedding day. It's a free ride, when you've already paid. It's the good advice that you just didn't take...and so forth.

I'm a little bit bitter after my messy breakup with Dave Coulier...but that really has little to do with my distress and dissatisfaction here. How ironic that, given the number of pleasant reviews this café garners, I would have such a disgusting experience. (By the way, these sweet Alanis Morissette references would be huge if it was 1995). 

I took two guests from out of town here while I showed them the wonders of NYC. I ordered the Avocado sandwich and, having eaten half, discovered that the entire bottom of the roll was covered in thick mold. Not just a little. Like a fully cultivated farm. After making some super witty joke about the roll being a metaphor for the city itself and repeatedly swallowing the hot vomit attempting to hurriedly escape my throat, I called the server over to show her my sick petri dish of a sandwich. While she apologized profusely and the meal was comped, I have to be honest- I will never come back here again unless I need penicillin and find myself in a position where I cannot afford it.

The devil is in the details, good sirs and madams. Serving bread with mushrooms growing out of it is a fairly big detail to overlook. It was like handing me ten thousand moldy spoons when all I needed was a fresh, delicious knife...or whatever.",1.0
"The waiter started off ok,... we took a minute to order. It went downhill from there....wait time was long on a Monday night. It took forever to get silverware (like after the appetizer and after the meal came) , we got the wrong food, my soda was seltzer instead of sierra mist. The appetizer was the only thing that was correct and good. I got warm salmon which was ok till they covered in this orange ooze and over cooked the lobster that was supposed to be on top. The broccoli was smelly and warm for a minute before it turned cold. The thing they label as mac and cheese was dry and crappy not mac and cheese by anyones standards. My husband got sizzling chicken and shrimp, there was cheese on the bottom for some reason. His meal was more appetizing than mine. The meal made me sick before I left as well as later in the night wasted 80+ dollars save your money and get a hot dog on the street.",1.0
"Today is the first time I've been here. I'm using to eating high quality sushi. From that background, this sushi was terrible. I forced myself to eat the three rolls that I got and left feeling a bit sick. Too much rice, rice was slightly hard, relatively small amount of fish, fish tasted old and was slightly rubbery. This is my first and last time going there. Honestly I'd rather pay 40 dollars for sushi that I'd enjoy than 23 dollars for sushi that makes me nauseous. 2 stars instead of one because the gyoza was pretty good, but that's about it.",1.0
"I would give no star to this place. I really hope that the Department of Health can close this place down. Maybe the price and 50% discount is a good deal, but be aware that you will be paying for you diarrhea. First of all, there were cockroaches running around the bar. Second, there bowl with edamame had a big dirty stain on the bottom. And third, their sushi plates are very broken on the edges, so you may end up chewing on a piece of ceramic. For having a nightmare time at the Sushi park, the owner offered no discount. Instead, he brought the soap offering me to clean the stain by myself. Dear Sushi Park, you are an embarrassing neighbor.",1.0
"I had the spicy tuna over rice.  It tasted weird, not right.  And I may have had mild food poisoning from eating it.  I had to go home and sleep it off.  I asked for hot water and was given cold water ice.  I asked the the waiter if I could get hot water instead and he yells out, ""HOT WATER??""  The way he yelled was kind of rude, kind of like the way parents yell at kids.",1.0
Waking up at 430 am was extremely tough. I got to the airport and wanted to grab some food to get a bit of energy. The dunkin donuts line was sooooo long so I decided to grab a sandwich from here. I grabbed the smoked salmon bagel thinking they would make it for me but it was pre-made and packed in the fridge already. Thy didn't even ask if I wanted it toasted. I had to ask then to toast the soggy bagel.  After I ate it I felt sick and my stomach wasn't feeling to well. Never again eat pre pack food that has salmon in it...,1.0
"I came here for lunch today (6/17) god oh mighty was it bad....

From the sound of most of these reviewers they're huge fans of chain restaurant vibes...

The ""service"" was embaressingly phoney... I'd expext the failed actor/actress vibes in mid town.... Not brooklyn... Unless the entire thing is a giant joke which would make it hiliarious... But who on earth as a waiter actualy starts with ""my name is blahblahblah and i'll be your server""

As for the food.... Not only do i feel sick to my stomach... But it took well over 30 mins at 2:30 in the afternoon.... Was ungodly salty to the point that my water glass had to constantly be re-filled (mind you i ordered a burger...not pretzels) it was also gross, homemade ketchup thats bad doesnt make you artisinal just buy heinz for christ sake... 

The Maple Fries!?!? Theyre almost unedible... I think my friend and i each had maybe 2?... And couldnt eat anymore....

On a positive note... I stole an onion ring from the unbussed disgusting table next to us and it was pretty great....

Oh and the ""ranch whatever it is"" was spoiled and effervescent i woulda said something but at a chain restaurant thats a big no no

Also the decor? How on earth do people say this looks nice?! Enginered faux vintage floor and wall panels? Give me a break... At least the new starbucks are made with real wood...

Gross gross gross",1.0
"This place is as good as they say... but be warned: If you get a later time slot, the food and ingredients (especially the pre-prepared portions) have been sitting for a few hours. You can see them pull them out of ramekins, pantries, and refrigerators already prepped, waiting to be delicately sauteed and adorned with delicious sauces. Still (and this especially applies to seafood), you have to sort of wonder how fresh it is... #2... like all tasting/Omakase menus, if you're a health- and body-conscious person, this place will make you uncomfortably full. I mean, you feel bad about not eating the world-class food... especially since the chefs are right in front of your face, which, admittedly is part of the experience, but, as with sitting in the front row at a comedy performance, you feel bad if you're not laughing at their jokes (aka gavage-ing their food and smiling about it even though you're several courses in)... #3... be prepared for the explosive diarrhea that will surely follow your experience. Seriously. The only other place that ranks worse than this in terms of the hours that followed was Le Cirque.",1.0
"I would like to say first and foremost that I love the people that work here. The petite Spanish man with the pony tail is fast and friendly and the woman with the hair net and hips- sultry and accurate. However, every time I eat here, about 30 minutes post getting back home I get sick. I'm talking about complete nausea. It's horrible to admit, especially given that I want so much to like everything about this place. And the food actually does taste amazing. But somewhere in between the high fructose sweetness of those frozen margaritas and the vegetable oils used for cooking un organic meats- I am sick every time. I've tried three separate occasions to make it work, but it just won't. They have an amazing groupon offer right now if any one is up for trying it out. Maybe it's just me? I hope so!

The East Roll was edible, but not appetizing. The Rock n Roll was chewy(Yes, chewy and fatty eel. Basically Eel skin.) and the Alaska roll was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!! The salmon was ROTTEN.  I have been eating sushi regularly for over 25 years. I also cook quite often. I know rotten fish when I see, smell, and unfortunately bravely(or accidentally) taste it.

"When I order from China Place, I'm never disappointed. I usually order vegetable type things, with soup, etc. One time they called to tell me there was pork in one of the soups, which I was okay with, and impressed they would call first to see if I was a vegetarian. The older delivery guy is very nice, and the time delivered is well before the estimated time of arrival. The price is good, for what I consider good quality Chinese food.

My shoddy star review is because I just found out that this place and Hana Sushi share an address, which really saddens and scares me since I am pretty sure I had food poisoning from the sushi here.  NEVER order the sushi or anything that isn't well cooked. Even if I didn't get food poisoning from here, it wasn't that good anyway, the  sushi that is, because it was mostly rice, very little anything else in the middle.",1.0
"Overpriced brunch. Had a 12 dollar Bloody Mary that was lacking liquid. Went on a crowded/busy Saturday and the server never came back after she took our order. Steak and eggs was a tiny portion and made me sick and my girlfriend's huevos rancheros (she orders them everywhere) were the ""worst she's ever had.""
I've been here once before and had a good time so I'm sure the bad experience is in part to a busy day and a bad tempered server, but I also know Schillers can do better.

"Yesterday we went there for dinner based on five stars reviews. I am very surprised that anyone can give this place five or even four stars. 
The appetizer was ok.  We also ordered veal stew and a duck dish.  The veal stew was tasty but the portion was very small.  It literally contained four small pieces of veal with a lot of fat and four pieces of pure Fat!  The duck breast was also very fat and in addition was overpowered by peppercorns.
The service was fine but the bread arrived together with an appetizer.  I don't understand the point of this.  Every restaurant we went to during the years, the bread is served way before anything else. 

The worth thing is my husband had food poisoning and I did not feel good either.",1.0
"I've been here a few times over the past couple of years for a drink which wasn't bad. For a drink when in this area I prefer Project Parlor or the no name bar beside do or dine. I had avoided eating here when I heard the burger is $16, till yesterday because I read online that they do a weekday English breakfast. 

Over the weekend I had a real craving for home and a Irish/English breakfast so I went with a friend to the Black Swan for brunch.  They ordered the $14 burger and a beer deal. I had a taste of the burger and it was good. The fries where really good too and there was a lot of them. It would have been better if we just shared that or better gone somewhere else.

My friend was very annoyed about the state of their pint. My pint of radeberger had no head and barely any carbonation but my friends had so much they could not drink it for the first 5 mins. The place was not busy it was just amateur hour.  

My $13 Full English Breakfast not only was one of the worst things I have ever paid money to pass my lips also made me feel really sick all day yesterday. All the stuff on the plate that you would find in an American breakfast were totally fine and the correct hot temperature, the fried eggs and hash browns were perfect. Who ever cooked the food does not know how to cook black and white pudding, rashers, mushrooms or sausages. I feel like a idiot for eating it because the meat was dangerously undercooked. Both the black and white pudding was totally undercooked and mushy. The bacon was cooked but had not started to change color and go crispy in the slightest. Sausages were lukewarm, the mushrooms were cold, the beans were too sweet and lukewarm. 

Had the bartender thought to ask us how our food or drinks were I would have told him directly.",1.0

"Pros: 

(+) Old school diner look with a modern twist

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All I have to say is....what the hell happen to this place? 

Clarke's is a fairly new place, just opened this year. If you are a local, then you should already know that prior to Clarke's this place was initially another burger joint called ""GoodBurger"". However GoodBurger was everything but a good burger joint for the simple fact that the service was horrible, slow and the food was mediocre. When GoodBurger closed down to make it's way for this new place Clarke's Standard, my heart beat the tempo of promise. As a matter of fact, the first couple months was excellent! If I did my review a couple months ago, I would have given the place a 5 star just for the simple fact that the place was fully staffed with people who had excellent customer service, quick, friendly and on top of that, the burgers were on point and flavorful! Don't even get me started on the french fries. I had  become an addict, that I had to enter the ""Say No to French Fries Rehab Clinic."" No lie, it used to take me 5 minutes to get my entire meal and the manager at the time (Anthony) would walk up and down the kitchen to make sure things were running smoothly. 

Fast forward 2 months on hiatus from this place for the simple fact that this place was too addicting. Now I ask this, what the hell happened to this place? Since I last came, the quality of this place just plummeted like the Great Depression stock market! The old manager here transferred to a different location, there is now different staff, the food was horrible and the service was slow! 

I had ordered my usual burger meal that used to only take 5 minutes on a busy day...and this day it was almost 20 minutes on a slow day and I was still standing waiting for my meal. I walked over to the grill area and there were 2 cooks at the grill. I saw a hispanic girl prepping a burger, and naturally I thought she was prepping mine. But she looked at me and took a huge bite out of the hamburger! What? Did my eyes just see correctly? She was straight eating a hamburger from the grill! The second cook was a guy texting away on his phone with his gloves still on and spatula in hand! Don't believe me, see picture here: http://alturl.com/22q89 Is that even sanitary? I made a complaint to the cashier asking what was taking so long. 
The cashier yelled at the cooks, ""she's been standing here for a long time, where's her burger!?"" One of the cooks asked ""what did she order?"" which confirms to me that they never made my order. The girl who was probably eating the hamburger at the grill was probably eating MY order! SMH. Don't they have a break room to eat their food or eat at the table like the rest of the people during their breaks? I don't think she was on her break though because she was in between eating her burger and tending to the fries.

So, I had to wait another few minutes for my burger. I was on my lunch break so my time was limited since I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for my food. By the time I got back to work, I took 1 bite out of my burger just to find it still RAW! I had asked for medium-well done and I got medium-RAW. Picture: http://alturl.com/7mu9j
The lettuce was old and not crisp at all, it had browning spots on it with mushy edges. There was no time for me to take the burger back since my lunch break was over so I threw it out. It was horrible! I barely had any time to finish my fries. But still somehow after eating whatever I had, I ended up having food poisoning and was sent home early from work. 

What's going on Clarke's? I used to love this place. But the way it is now, not so much. Looked like I was having de-ja-vu all over again with GoodBurger since it seems like that's the route this place is heading right now until they make some serious changes.",1.0
"36th and broadway location - I dunno. I had the mediterranean quinoa salad. It wasn't that good for me. The quinoa seems like it wasn't cooked right, way too much moisture and the kale was rubbery probably cause of their quick blanching process. the dressing was mustardy tasting. Other than that it was kinda bland. I dont think it was tossed properly cause the ingredient weren't mixed well. It just didn't taste right. I'd probably give it a second chance but usally when I get a quinoa salad I go to Cafe Blossom, more expensive but leaps and bounds better.

UPDATE: Threw half of it out. Had to call out sick the remainder of the day. Probably won't return. My suspicion something with the kale and how dry kale was being dipped in the same hot water bath, of course the quinoa was water logged. I dunno but I'm taking a half day cause of it.",1.0

"""Superficial / Lacking Substance"" seems like the best descriptor.  I had lunch on a weekday and the first floor was filled with customers.  All of the key pieces were there but it didn't come together for me.

The servers were really nice and energetic but also inattentive.  On the other hand, the hostess stopped by several times to see if I enjoyed my dishes.

The dishes were intriguing, different, and clearly upscale but tasted like they were made from unfresh ingredients or in a hurried manner.   The particulars of the Tuna Tartare were each fine when deconstructed but tasted badly together.  The chive oil overpowered everything.  The grauffette potatoes were too crispy for me and tasted almost burnt.  The Roasted Organic Chicken was, meh, fine.  A lot of work clearly went into it but the taste just wasn't there.  The Chickpea Fries were pretty good but sadly tasted like something I'd get at Waffle House.  The Banana Bread Pudding was fine as well.  I felt bad for not liking any of the dishes.

The dishes didn't pair well together; I was actually sick afterward.  Nothing was unhealthy nor unsanitary.  It's just the mix of tuna, oil, fried food, chicken, cream, etc. really didn't sit well for about two hours afterward.

Two ladies seated next to me began a conversation and told me they were regulars.  They prefer the fish much more than anything.  They seemed a bit dismayed by the inconsistent service that day.

I was concerned that JoJo offers cheeseburgers on the menu.  Why?  Probably because some customers don't appreciate French dishes and JoJo feels the need to please everyone even though it dilutes the menu.

JoJo looked like a high-end restaurant but lacked substance during my experience.  Almost seemed like a restaurant that was great years ago but lost its glory.",1.0

"DIRTY. Been sick for almost 24 hours since eating here. Chicken, rice, shrimp with garlic sauce. Should be benign enough, but I can barely move after ingesting their putrid, dirty food. It's a shame, since most of the food options on the UWS are so bland, but I'm never eating here again.",1.0
"This place would get my last star if they have more seats...well its my fault tho...i always went in without any reservations, which ended up waiting for 45~75 mins...

I like how they are not too strict on the rules, such as, they won't force you out when your 2 hours mark is approaching; or if you have a large party (and a room), half of you can get bbq and the other half hot pot, then share the food together. 

Service is good, they will come over refill the broth, water, and scoop out the bubble out of your pot.

Food is fresh, lot of varieties, it has most of the basic hot pot stuff. If you want something special, you can always pay the additional price. I love their thin slice beef & the tufo skin...so good

Sauce....for some reasons, if i dipped my food into their sauce, i'll have a blast 30 mins after the dinner. (Blast as in diarrhea blast). If i ate without dipping any sauce, im fine. DON'T DOUBT ME, I've tested for a few times...it could be just me....",1.0
"We walked into this place on a cold afternoon - after a busy day where we had nothing to eat all day this self-proclaimed ""New York joint"" appeared to be everything we were looking for: cozy, warm, varied menu, 3/4 full.

But that changed soon enough:

First, they have a ""B"" grade from the health inspector.  I dismissed this as a bad break or unlucky timing.  

We ordered soup, latkes, onion rings and two 3 El burgers.  The burger is $23 so I was expecting something amazing.  It was average at best:  the special blend was flavorless, bacon seemed to be flaccid and undercooked, the carmelized onions and cheese were indistinguishable in flavor and texture.  Awful! 

Go to Del Fresco's and get a far better burger for a buck or two more.  

My friend didn't enjoy her undercooked burger (medium rare came out rare) so we ordered fried chicken: 2 drumsticks and a wing for $21.  No acknowledgement from the waiter that 4/5 of her burger was on the plate and we asked for something else.

The worst is yet to come:  We head directly home from the restaurant.  90 minutes later (at 8:30 on a Saturday night) I say I'm not feeling great and lay down.  At 9:30 I wake up knowing I have to vomit but I'm in that state where you wait it out.  

9:45 - bathroom for violent vomiting
10:00 - back to bed, shivering under the covers
10:50 - wake up again, having to vomit immediately
11:00 - back to bed...
12:00 - another trip to the bathroom  

this went on EVERY HOUR UNTIL 5:00 am - that's eight trips to throw-up $200 worth of awful food.  The 4:00 and 5:00 trips were 100% dry heaves so you know something wasn't right. 

Stay away from the disgusting kitchen and the over-priced $15 drinks.",1.0
"I'm so glad Halal Guys actually has its own spot now! How awesome is that!? So now, rather than waiting 45 minutes on a line in the cold, I can simply order the same delicious halal food from here. So worth it! I always get the chicken and lamb over rice...you can't go wrong with that.

My only concern was that when I had the lamb I started feeling a little sick. I wasn't sure if it was me or the lamb. I've had food from here before and this was the first time this has happened to me. So, I'm not exactly sure if my stomach was just acting up that day or something was wrong with the lamb (I'm hoping it isn't the meat.)

Either way, the food is still delicious. Can't wait to go back again!",1.0
"I'm forced to shop there do to the fact that there aren't anymore healthy food stores in the area. The truth of the matter is that the food has been spoiled on 4 occasions. The first three were with the organic chicken and the fourth time was with the cucumbers. Fortunately you can smell the chicken but the cucumbers actually made me sick and when I went to complain the manager ""Arif"" was extremely rude. I made 6 trips to the store from sheepshead bay Brooklyn for one shopping list and I asked for a discount of 10% which would have covered my fuel costs and any wrong doing on their behalf. Instead of a discount, I was put on trial and accused of potentially lying, even though he watched me purchase the first order and refunded me the same day.
Their is a health food store on the same avenue about two blocks away with much fresher produce and nicer people , but less selection.  If you can avoid Flatbush food coop , it would be in your best interest ....",1.0
"This review is for the dinner. I see that some of the good reviews are toward the dim sum.

First off, most Chinatown restaurants give peanuts as a little thing to snack on while ordering dinner. This place gives chips. It isn't a bad thing, just mildly noteworthy.

We ordered about 6 dishes to share as a family. The waiter forgot to put in one of the more important orders (a fried rice). When we finally did receive it, we didn't receive any bowls. Any other Chinatown restaurant would at least ask if you want bowls, but it's typically given right away when a fried rice or noodle variety is ordered. The waiter also muttered something under his breath, right after asking why we didn't just use our plates. When we finally did get the bowls, 2 of them weren't washed properly and still had some left over rice. We notified a young waiter and even he was shocked.


We ordered a pork chop dish and two of the pieces were under cooked. I didn't realize that food poisoning was a potential entree at the meal. It was like a really rare steak, which isn't supposed to work for pork, since it comes from a much dirtier animal.

We ordered a garlic roasted chicken, which came with too much soy sauce.
Eggplant king something (typically fried eggplant with some sweet and spicy hot sauce) that came in with a sour spicy hot sauce.

At the end of the night, our main waiter apologized for the meal experience, and blamed the young waiter (who did nothing wrong).

This has honestly been the worst restaurant in Chinatown I've ever been to.",1.0

"Be careful if you are thinking of eating at this place--they use SPOILED FOOD MATERIALS.(unless you want you and your guests food poisoned)
 

I ordered the ""water-cooked meat slices"" to treat my friends from Sichuan, where the famous Sizchuan spicy food comes from. They know the stuff. When we got served the entry, my friends immediately noticed something is weird with the meat. But out of the thought that the food might taste differently since its in another country, they double checked. It still tasted wrong.

We asked the server if he knew what's going on in the dish or with the materials. He went to checked with the kitchen and said nothing is wrong. Then a manager-looking guy came to us, claiming that we tasted it differently because we don't know how things work here ""in the states"". 

What?

We realized the debate over if the raw material was fresh or not seem pointless, so we just decide to pay and leave. But at the meantime I heard the dude talking to another guy in Chinese, about being careful next time about ""mixing up"" something. The moment I heard that, I knew they used SPOILED FOOD MATERIALS.

They have a Michelin star, yes. That's why we went. But there is a fact we need to realized: this restaurant does not use fresh food materials. 

What's worse, they lie if you are in doubt.",1.0
"Dirty! Stay Away! Went to the Tribecca Amish Market for about nine years (yes, I am lazy and dumb). I even have an Amish Discount Card. I purchased the potato salad, from the salad bar. Of course found a hair in it, yuck. They are unlcean and won't replace their refrigerators. Stay away from any of the frozen or refrigerated foods. Take a look at the temperature gauges. Sometimes the food is kept at over 50 degrees. It would even make a dog sick. Horrible New Owners (talking to you Joe) purchased Amish Market in February 2013.

"I'm not one for writing bad reviews, but my experience with this place made me sick (literally)! My advice to you is, if you decide to eat here, make sure you actually get what you ordered, they messed up our order (two kinds of meatballs, two different sauces, not complicated)!! If you have any dietary restrictions I would steer clear of eating here.",1.0
"Pros: 
They have a wide variety of mac and cheese options (classic, four cheese, margherita, lobster, mushroom, cheeseburger, etc). Their utensils (fork and knife) come attached together quite ingeniously. If you order a medium dish, you get to take home a yellow elbow macaroni container.

Cons: The place has two tables. The wait time was 20 minutes for a small lobster mac and cheese and I was pretty much the only one there. The smell was horrific. I have had lobster mac and cheese at two other places (Capital Grille and somewhere else) and they know what they're doing. After a few bites I was actually sick. I ordered a classic mac and cheese to make myself feel better and it was alrightish (def better than Smac's classic mac), but I was so nauseous from the lobster one that I couldn't eat. I would share the lobster mac with my enemies. Not a good place for groups, or dates, unless you want to wait and kill your partner.",1.0

This place has changed. Horrible customer service and the food left out of the bag again like always when I asked them to check I got attitude and sure enough items were missing. As they unpacked the bag in front of me the guys hands were all over our fries with the hand without the glove all on our fries. Department of health wouldnt like that... and then the fry that fell on the counter he put it back in the bag. Disgusting I was so disgusted I threw the fries out when we got home.

"Food is definitely not worth it. 

It's not because we waited almost 2 hours to receive the food to delivered. 
Delivery guy said he is the only person for the night and had to deliver 10 different places, including Laguardia. I almost fell asleep in my PJs. I guess my house is last stop for that batch of delivery...

They could have at least let us know, food is gonna be late. I thought order never went through Grubhub. On top of that they do charge $5 delivery fee. Unbelievable. 

Food wasn't cold at least. 
However who wants pay $15+ for a can of chef boyardee quality. 
Tomato sauce tastes like from can, not homemade. 
Avoid tiramisu- all u can taste is soaked in liquor, not sweet dessert.

Also got the Lil Onion ring which was not worth it and greasy. I got a turkey burger and my bf got the beef ribs plate. Again, huge portions, greasy, not very good food quality. The only thing I really liked was their warm cornbread. I felt pretty sick after we left! And we eat out often so I know it must've not been very good food.

"I was excited to come to this new location for dessert. Four of us was probably seated. And then we order our desserts. However, the waitress took one of our order wrong. But it's not big deal, we got it change right away. My friend's hot sesame soup came first, the waitress totally forgot to give up spoon. After he got the spoon, he tasted it and told me, that is a supermarket quality of dessert. Very cheap and so watery. So he felt this $4 worth of money gone to the garbage. And he had diarrhea. Second my friend hot blueberry tea came and it is in a paper cup, like those you order take out, not serve in some fancy tea cup, and plus, it's just water with a tea bag. She was very disappointed. Third, my husband ate the ice cream with clear jelly, the tasted didn't really match and my husband went to bathroom 3 times after he ate the dessert. My order was A.01 on the menu, it is the only thing that is safe to eat and taste good. When we ask the waitress what to recommend and she only say the first one and didn't recommend the rest of the stuff. So anyone wanna go there please beware the quality of the food. I definitely won't go back since non of us like the food. I rather go back to KULU for Chinese style dessert and prince tea house for nice flower tea serve in fancy teapot and tea cup.

I tried another green one a day later when I felt better and that one made me sick too- I had my husband smell them since I wasn't sure if that fermented smell was just how the juice was or if they went bad and he immediately went ""nope, do not drink another sip""   The lemon cayenne was the only one that hadn't gone bad sitting on my door step from 1-3 hours. Its a shame you can't ask when for a time frame...usually things aren't delivered that late for me.

"Let me start out by saying that i have been a general manager of a restaurant before and also i have been a waiter so i do know what goes on behind the scenes at a restaurant. First off the place seems clean but there's a vibe of ""gritty-ness"" about the place. My wife and i are staying close by and wanted a stiff drink with some Mexican food so i checked Yelp. The review are decent nothing great but whatever...... Let me tell you that i will never go back to this location and i will always listen to yelp from now on, the reviews are correct! Here goes my experience, warm air no A/C stuffy as hell warm in the bar even before we got our drinks! Oh about the drinks i got a Cadillac margarita its suppose to come with an extra shot of booze that we got 10 minutes after our waitress brought our drinks to our table. Wow really arent i spending American money here? Because it doesnt seem like it. The lacksadaisical attitude of our waitress eventhough she was very sweet and nice was part of the problem here. Now about the food, nothing to say about it its not good but its not bad either makes me miss California especially the Mexican food. But later on that evening my wife did get sick so we'll never never go back to this dive again. I hate that i spent no wasted my money here. Now the ""cherry on top "" of this faaaaantasic fun time. The waitress gives me the bill and has highlighted her name ( cool ) and HIGHLIGHTED the highest tip percentage amount suggested! Really?!?!?! I usually am a big tipper becuase i have been a waiter before so i know how hard this job can be but i gave her less than half of the highlighted amount eventhough the waitress was really sweet but slow as hell. it was very arrogant of her to do that.

"Seamless Delivery Review:

Ordered on a Saturday night around 7:00pm with an expected wait time of 30-40 minutes and the food didn't arrive until 8:45pm.  Furthermore, while most of the food was tasty, it made me sick afterwards (and I have an iron stomach).

Pros: 

1) Most of the food was good.

I really liked the Japchae with vermicelli noodles and thought it was very flavorful.  The mandoo gui (fried dumplings) were also pretty good and, most importantly, not greasy.

2) The food arrived hot.

Cons:

1) Obviously, feeling sick afterwords was not very fun.

2) The hostess repeatedly lied to me about the food having already left the restaurant.

I called the restaurant after 1 hour, 1.5 hours, and 1.75 hours inquiring about my food.  Each time I called the hostess told me that the food had already left and was on its way and would be there shortly.  The reason I know this is a lie is because the food arrived hot. While the food arrived hot was a positive, unless the deliveryman had portable burners on his bicycle there is no way the food arrived as hot as it did unless it had left the kitchen fairly recently (not prior to my first call as the hostess would have had me believe).

3) The food was not packaged well and the juices from the japchae leaked all over the bag.

4) The jin mandoo was falling apart and soggy and just a total mess.

To be honest, if I hadn't gotten sick this review would have been a 3-star review because the food itself was pretty good (with the exception of the jin mandoo).  However, between the lackluster delivery operation and my feeling ill I think 1-star is a fair characterization of my experience.",1.0

Do not eat here. Food is overpriced. It's a rip off and will make you feel sick. I'm writing this the next day and I still feel it. We ordered pulled pork and wings.

Since this was outside I'll give benefit of doubt the roach problem comes from the neighboring buildings...

I asked for extra spicy food, but it was not spicy at all, and way too sweet. The kicker is that I'm sick this morning. I'm not saying that it was definitely the cold chicken and rice that may have been prepared in less-than-hygienic conditions that made me sick, but I'm also not saying that it definitely wasn't.

"FLY IN FOOD!!!! I ordered to go fried chicken and ramen and the fried chicken came with a BIG FAT fly big as a nickel fried right into the batter of one of the pieces of chicken.

Needless to say I vomited several times until I felt dizzy and sick and called 311 to file a formal complaint. They are currently investigating and will contact me shortly for an interview. They have told me roughly 30 restaurants per week are shut down for immediate health and hygiene reasons and that this is a very likely candidate to be terminated. Do not ever eat here, imagine the type of kitchen that would allow large flies to regularly land on food being cooked.   You are not only potentially risking eating a fly in your meal but your are guaranteed to be eating the remnants of one from that day in one of the dishes or deep fryers used to cook all the meals. This is a textbook definition chain restaurant with a good taste but a cheap price and a cheap staff thrown into a high volume area. It will be shutdown and no person should risk eating out of a trash can in nyc that these flies buzz around. If you eat this restaurant you are literally eating off a ghetto projects dumpster.",1.0
"me definitely thinks not.
i'll keep it short and simple:
1- sushi was not fresh, it was very mushy.
2- waitress was rude and refused to write down our orders and we had to tell her 3 times!
3- 1/2 of us got sick from it the next day.
4- warm sake did NOT taste good.
pros:
1- free red bean icecream was yum.
2- cucumber/pickle was refreshing and crunchy.",1.0
"I really wish I took a picture of what they had the nerve to deliver to me, I ordered Salmon sushi. OMG I have never seen anything like it first its full of FAT which means they use the cheapest part of the fish next to the stomach, then they delivered it without taking all the skin off. Then I call and ask them to replace it because my mom refused for me to ask for a refund, the delivery guy asks me to open the case so to show him proof, I show him and he was angry with me!!!! despite him clearly seeing that the salmon was covered in skin!!!!! THEN tells me to go inside and get him a plastic bag. You think that was all? NOOOOO. I did eat the eel roll and my husbands fried fish roll.... vomiting ALL NIGHT!!!! Disgusting.",1.0
"For the crime of wanting a decent meal before flying across the country, my husband and I are paying with a day of nausea. I don't know who Todd English is, but I assume he's some large-headed celebrity chef, because normal chefs don't feel the need to put their name on the food or to ruin perfectly simple, classic meals with a bunch of unnecessary nonsense.

Husband had a burger, which he said was good, but not great. It came with a pile of fries that looked wonderful, but were soggy and oversalted. The only crispy part of the fries was the random pile of black herbs sitting *under* the fries. The herbs were also salty. The burger came served on a brioche, which, apparently, justifies its hilarious price tag. Now, I know that airport food can cost twice as much as food in another location, but even at half the price, it would have been a ripoff. 

The portabella quesadilla was just a travesty, start to finish. A quesadilla is such a classically easy dish, it really takes a celebrity chef to screw it up. How? Well, you could put four different cold salsas on top of it, along with a massive pile of cold onions and a wholly unnecessary mess of cold, slimy cilantro, so that food that is meant to be hot and crispy is cold and soggy after the fourth bite. The corn salsa was sweet, which might have been OK on its own, but made no sense with the other flavors. The salsa fresca was tasteless, comprised of mealy tomatoes. The avocado crema was just confusing and didn't go with anything else. It's pretty much thin green sour cream. I'm not sure what the additional oily green mess smeared all over everything was supposed to add. 

As for the portabellas, they were homeopathic-grade, i.e. scarcely detectable. I pulled the quesadilla apart just to confirm their microscopic presence. The interior of the dish contained far more red onions than mushrooms, which made the giant pile of onions on top really seem like overkill. By that time, the cheese was a sad, congealed mess and the tortilla was simply wet. 

This meal cost $40! It was maybe worth 9. But at Todd English, you will pay $9 to add some chicken to your already ridiculously overpriced salad. An order of chips and salsa costs $8. Note to Todd English: chips and salsa should be free, on the table, when you sit down. If your cost for chips and salsa is more than 50 cents a serving, you need to sue your suppliers. And if you you legitimately think you should be making a profit of $7.50 on chips and salsa, your customers should be suing you. Class action lawsuit, anyone?

We should have known what we were getting into when we noticed that each table was stocked with 3 bottles of water: plain, Fiji, and Pellegrino. No doubt if you so much as touch them, you'll be charged, probably at a 600% markup.

Anyway, now we're both sick to our stomachs, and we have an entire day of travel ahead of us.",1.0
"I feel as if we're talking about two different places, or I walked in on an off day. The place is very old diner. With non matching plates and paper cups for the coffee. There was only one waitress working on this sunday.  This was listed as the number one place to dine for breakfast in the bronx. When I drove up the IHOP a block away had more business.  I left feeling sick. My French Toast tasted and smelled weird like the batter of egg and milk had gone bad, and not to mention was way under cooked. Every thing else was far from good. Just below par. My girlfriends waffle even tasted weird. Maybe they make the batter on a Thursday and hold it all weekend or till its gone. If that's the case, who knows what I digested.",1.0
"I never ever write reviews but I had to this time. I normally come to eat here often on weekends because my best friend loves Chinese food and I live near by. Food is okay. Jajangmyun taste so sweet and any foods with sea food taste so weird & gotten sick quite often. 

Anyways, I am ok with that. What bothers me most is, that Korean Chef there, he curses while we are eating food. Not at us but I guess he is pissed off or something. I can literally hear him yelling and cursing when I sit near by kitchen. It's just very unprofessional and don't understand why you would curse when there are many Korean people eating in that place!",1.0
"Went here the last night of our Anniversary trip to NYC, Sept. 25, 2013.  
My husband ordered a burger which he thought was pretty good. 
 I wanted the Bucatini (pasta dish) but waitress said they were out of clams.  
I decided to order the raw Seafood Combo instead.  Since clams were supposed to come on that plate, waitress asked what I'd like in place of the clams - I said shrimp - but they gave me extra oysters....not sure why she bothered asking.  
But still I was excited that a crab claw came with it.  The shrimp were big, tasted ok, nothing special.  The oysters were small with no flavor but at least the cocktail sauce was good.
I excitedly gobbled down my first bite of the crab claw....immediately smelled something awful and had an awful taste in my mouth, but unfortunately it was too late - I'd already swallowed it.  At first I thought it was just me...but I smelled the crab claw again and knew it was rotten.  I told the waitress who picked up my plate and took it to a man behind the bar without saying anything to me (I didn't know if she was mad - or what - but since that's how she'd been all night, I didn't think too much about it.)
She didn't come back and say anything, but eventually the man behind the bar came over, said yes, it was indeed rotten and asked if I'd like him to go downstairs and get another crab claw from another box - I said ""thanks, but no thanks.""  He asked if I'd like something else to replace it and I opted for shrimp.  He brought me 3 shrimp and said he was sorry, but that's just how it is sometimes with seafood, you never know what you'll receive.  Maybe they should smell their seafood before serving it then!
Guess I should be grateful he gave me 3 shrimp, but if I had known I would be sick for 3 days after that, I would have asked them to take my meal off our bill!  My husband said the only thing that kept me out of the hospital was the fact that I was drinking alcoholic drinks with my dinner.
Guess I shouldn't have ordered seafood from a place named LT BURGERS, but since the Raw menu was more extensive than the 3 burgers shown on the menu, I assumed seafood was more their thing.  We ate seafood at several places in NYC and here in NC, we eat a lot of seafood and crab claws - this is the first time I have ever gotten rotten food anywhere....lesson learned about LT Burger.",1.0
"Got intoxicated. Be aware. 

We LOVE Thai food and where looking for a place to lunch for me and my son at Manhathan. We visited the restaurant on May 29, 2015. 

THE GOOD
- Place was clean
- Attentions very good. 
- Location is nice

THE BAD
- Thai Chicken Wings has NO taste at all. Have it returned. They did with no complains.
- Singha beer taste like any other beer. Besides it was warm.
- The Pork Chop dish has good taste but but had no Wow factor.
- The Seafood Pad Prik looks weird. Was hard to know what i was eating.
- The Ginger Spice drink was refreshing and nicely presented.
 
I am not gonna get into graphical details about the intoxication process but:
- Lots of stomach pain and cold sweeting.
- Big time diarrea and vomiting.
- Spend 2 days only taking water.
- Become extremely weak.
- Today (4 days later) i am still under antibiotics.
- Eating little food.
- Still have not recovered my regular life.

Really sorry to tell this story. We love Thai Food but this one resulted the MUST expensive by all means and ruined my weekend at New York.

Hope my case was rare",1.0
"I love chipotle but this location is pretty horrible. The staff and managers are rude and the food is inconsistent. The white rice is often overcooked or completely flavorless and the chicken isn't always cooked enough. They also refuse to correct mistakes. When a burrito rips or they put the wrong topping on they just expect you to take it and talk back if you say something. They also think they can get away with talking about customers or telling each other to give you the old ingredients so they can put new ones out by speaking in Spanish, but I can absolutely understand what they are saying and it's just rude. The line gets backed up, and one time I asked for guac without being able to see it. When I got up to the counter I saw that it was completely brown and asked them to make me a new bowl without guac but they refused, assuring me that the guac had just been put out. It didn't taste right so I pushed it to the side, but I got sick and was throwing up all night.",1.0
"I have such mixed feelings about this place but I don't want to lead with the reason why. First let me tell you what I like about it. It's local, it's on the small side but the food is good and they deliver. The staff is very friendly and accomidating to their customers. I came in a party of four for a quick meal and we tried the sweet and sour chicken (I'll comment on this later), boneless spare ribs (best in the neighborhood), sesame chicken (average but decent) and fried jumbo shrimp with vegetable fried rice (crunchy and yummy).

The food was ready within 20 minutes and we were all served at the same time. I didn't expect the girl at the counter to bring it to us but she did. Most Chinese restaurants are self serve. She even opened our containers and placed them in front of the person who ordered. We also got a homemade ice tea and it was $1.50 for a large, easily enough to share. They even provided cups. They also threw in two free egg rolls because we ordered 4 meals. 

Everyone was happy with their food. We especially loved the boneless spare ribs. We all tried each others food. I really liked the way they prepared their vegetable fried rice, lots of peas and broccoli. They also offer the option of brown or white rice. While we were eating they checked on us to make sure everything was good and it was.

Now I don't know if this was a fluke or what the situation was but my son got sick a few hours later after we got home. I don't know why but we are assuming it was the food. He ordered the sweet and sour chicken. No one else had an issue or got sick. It could have also been something else entirely so I feel bad taking it out on their rating because I am just not sure. I personally liked my food and didn't have an issue so I am putting it down as 4 stars. We will however give them another try and if that changes I'll be back to update my review. I really hope it wasn't the food because this place was looking promising as my new go to chinese takeout spot. 

On our way out they thanked us immensely and gave us a menu to take home. They even cleared our table so we left them a nice tip. They were very gracious.",1.0
"Really like the hot bowls and have tried Chorizo, Moroccan, Ginger, and Red Curry. Lines are long - expect 30-40min wait if you go during 12:15pm - 1:15pm. 

The jasmine rice pairing with spinach or kale and the sauce are great. Texture and flavoring of meat is great with pork and beef being the best, chicken is decent.

Would have given it 4 stars, except that I have a stomach bug today starting at 3pm after eating the Red Curry bowl + grills vegetables. Not sure if I have mild food poisoning or something is wrong because the way they handle the food looks clean and process is solid. I did not eat anything else today after the bowl that I haven't eaten before. 

Roast Kitchen would get 5 stars as a great lunch place if the lines weren't so long. Think they are trying to improve that since they got added to Seamless.com",1.0

This place used to be so good. i knew the owner when it first opened and he had a vision for this place..to serve good food at affordable pricing. this was like prob 10 yrs ago. ownership has changed for sure. when u first walk in it smells like the bathroom. i was hungry so i ordered the lunch special. spring rolls which sucked. it wasnt even hot with some weird looking sauce that did not look appetizing. shrimp pad thai was the main course which was oversauced n jus didnt taste right. fast forward 5 hrs and im having the worst stomach ache of my life. There were sauces on my table which was on a napkin. a new customer came in and the waiter guy picked up my sauce and took the napkin under it and gave it to a customer!!! i was shocked!! soooo not clean. stay away if u dont wanna get sick. they bring the garbage in the same way u walk in. its horrible n ill  never come back,1.0
I work in the area so I decided to try this place out. I order the shrimp tacos without the avocado and a frozen mango margarita which the bartender recommend.

"I don't know why, but every time when I eat my take-outs here, I get a stomachache and diarrhea later. I always order salmon, so salmon, or rice, might be a reason that causes my stomachache.

"I love coming here for bagels! Great bagels, fast, even just getting a hot bagel without it being toasted is delicious. The coffee is yummy! And the cream cheese selection is great! 

Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and ordered a chicken philly because the normal one is made with roast beef. The chicken was touch and hard (I think it must've been microwaved due to the texture).  The bread was also hard in places and tough.  

Overall, it was just horrible. I only ate about half of a half, and felt sick so I didn't finish eating.

I will stick to bagels from now on, after my stomach recovers.",1.0
"The Shady Lady lives up to her name: she's pretty sketch. Went here for Saturday brunch. The place is cute, the girl who went around refilling coffee was a super sweetheart, the mimosa was good, and the management was professional. The food was overpriced and underwhelming. 

The mimosas are what they should be: champagne with OJ for color. Meals come with a complimentary mimosa (or bloody mary) and the mimosas are $6/pop. 

My husband got the smoked salmon BLT. It said it was meh, and definitely not worth the $19. Plus, the portion was kind of small for the price, but I will let you be the judge of that. I got the biscuits and gravy, which looked delicious, but tasted completely abysmal. The gravy was runny, tasted like burnt powdered cheddar liquid, and I'm pretty sure the biscuits came out of a can. I took two bites and was almost sick. I didn't eat any of it beyond that. 

The service was spotty at best, but the management was pretty on par, and for that this place gets two stars instead of one. The waitress was intermittent (and the place was half empty) and she got part of my order wrong. When the manager heard I was not a fan of my meal, he took it off my bill and offered me something else, but I refused because my stomach was still curdling from the thing that was masquerading as biscuits and gravy. 

Bottom line: don't go here for bottomless brunch or anything else. It's not worth it. If you want bottomless, go across the street to Sugar Freak where it's $5-10 cheaper and the food is sooo much better (and by better I mean edible).",1.0

"Flavor of India used to be good, about ten years ago. I was there last year and ordered takeout and was disappointed with the quality of the food. I decided to try it again and went last week with my family.
First of all the owner is rude and only greets certain customers. There was one guy who had multiple roles of waiter, dishwasher, server, etc. the service was horrible and extremely slow. When he set up our table he literally threw the utensils on the table and did not even provide a fork for my mom and we had to wait for him to come back so we could ask him. 
It was very hot inside and uncomfortable.
We waited over an hour for our food and the taste wasn't great. The waiter didn't understand English properly so it was difficult communicating with him. The waiter went around to the other tables to check on them but did not check on us. The establishment has a preference for certain customers. They are greedy for money, have very poor service, and cheap quality.  My brother ended up with diarrhea about an hour after eating. The owner should hire and train staff properly. When the owner is not counting receipts, he is hanging out with his friends drinking and chatting instead of paying attention to his customers. 
I have blacklist Flavor of India from my list. There are much better Indian restaurants if you go out into Long Island. Plus this place is pricey for crappy food and takes 12% service charge while providing horrible or no service. 
I would NOT recommend this place.",1.0

"I had heard about the legend of Momofuku's ""Crack Pie"" and decided I must get my hands on it when I visited New York.

The shop in Brooklyn is about the size of a walk-in closet, so don't expect to eat your dessert in the shop.

The line was out the door when I arrived (seemingly full of tourists from around the world). While in line, the cashier was yelling every 30 seconds to shut the door due to the air conditioning. It made me feel like I was in the scene in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where they go into the shrinking room and feel trapped.

Alas when I was to the front of the line, I ordered my crack pie, paid the overpriced $5.50, and received a small slice of supposed heaven in a little brown bag. The cashier was able to serve me right away as the pies are already made, sliced, bagged and stored ready for consumption in a chest fridge.

I ate the first bite and was severely disappointed. It was okay. What I thought was going to be a little slice of the best dessert ever, was merely a slice of sweetened butter with a crust. It made me a little sick to my stomach for the rest of the day.

For what it's worth, I've heard the cereal milk ice cream is also overrated. Nonetheless, I'd still say to try it merely to say you've been and gave it a shot. I have friends who still swear by the crack pie, I guess it just wasn't my thing.",1.0

We are avid sushi eaters and at quite a few different price levels. Our experience a couple of Friday nights ago does not leave me inclined to recommend it. I ate bad sushi and got very sick. They were short staffed and the food seemed to take a long time. More importantly, I called to alert them just in case any one else had the same experience and they were completely unresponsive. They claimed no one spoke english including the owner - something that is a bit hard to believe considering the conversations we had with the staff in the restaurant and the large amount of locations they have. We were a large group with a large bill. There are plenty of other suitable options for good, well priced sushi on Staten Island that I will patronize before ever entering this place again.",1.0

Bbq chic and ribs - I would give negative stars if I could- I feel sick after just eating it, I'm honestly starting too question whether or not the food I ordered was actually chicken and beef- cheap ranch and blue cheese packets. Corn on the cob you could tell was just frozen and lit was hard with no flavor . 

Onion rings were decent with ketchup. 
And buffalo chicken tenders were soggy when I got them. The biscuit tasted good but could only enjoy half of it cuz the other half was doused in the cheap sweet bbq sauce they smotherd all over the chicken and ribs.

The decor is beautiful, but there was a strange mix of adults/children. There was also a large party of 16 year olds girls celebrating their birthday which made for a weird vibe. Appetizers were the best part of the meal-chicken sticks/dumplings etc. I ordered Chicken Pad Thai for my entree which was sub par. Not nearly as good as many other places, and it left me feeling extremely sick later that night. Probably the worst part of my experience at Tao was that the bus boys were taking away our plates while we still had our chopsticks in hand!

"I really wanted to go to a vegan restaurant with my city dwelling, omnivore aunt and after finding a Groupon ($40 for $22) it seemed like the perfect place to knock her skeptical socks off. 
I ordered the Souper hero with the Nama Gori panini and the cauliflower chowder. The panini was great, I'm not a tofu loving vegan and I really enjoyed this. The soup was also very good. My aunt ordered the special salad which had Nama Gori on it as well, she seemed satisfied enough. At the end of the meal I ordered the brownie sundae because I cannot pass up vegan brownies when I can get my hands on them. 
However! After my aunt ate her salad she began to feel nauseous and had to excuse herself. The food eventually made her sick. Extremely disappointed! I believe it was their lettuce. The only reason I have it 2 stars was for my food. Can't believe I made my aunt sick by taking her to this place.",1.0
"THE WORST! If you're a lover of good, fresh, well prepared seafood, stay away from this place! Everything from the sub-par service to the sub-par (but still over-priced) food is enough to ensure that I'll never return to this highly disappointing neighborhood eatery.

P.S. ... to our woefully inexperienced server... the customer is never wrong. When someone tells you that the beer you just served them is warm, don't just stand there and stare at them, shrug your shoulders, and say that you really don't know what to do about it. Also, if you serve crab-stuffed mushrooms, crab-stuffed shrimp and crab-stuffed tilapia, why the hell can't you stuff a lobster or lobster tail, if that's what the customer wants? Also, if a woman being served a whole 2lb 40 plus $ lobster asks if the lobster can be removed from its shell by the kitchen, don't tell her that it isn't something that they do (without even asking), and then, condescendingly, ask her if she's ever used a nut cracker, and that the one that came with her lobster should be a big help. Additionally, after unsuccessfully trying to run through a credit card, don't come over to the table and announce to the card holder in a loud enough voice for everyone (including the birthday guest of honor) to hear, that the card isn't going through, and that it must be at its limit...especially when it wasn't, and, a second try at the insistence of the card-paying customer proved you wrong!

You own a business, your business is a bar and restaurant and half of your establishment is terrible how do you not fix it?????? After ordering from here (delivery) eating this disgusting garbage, getting sick and then going back to see that most of the reviews are complaints and it still isn't addressed??? You need to close shop or fix this ASAP.

Ordered a cheeseteak, I took a few bites and was met with grease and oil, the bread was oily, the meat was drenched in oil, cheese was oily and the meat tasted rotten. It was the worse cheesesteak I have ever tried in my life. 

The grease in the food, bread, etc.. means the grill was not cleaned properly (if ever), old or poor quality oil was used and WAY too much.

The fact that the owner, manager, chef would allow this food to leave their kitchen and go to a customer means that they don't care about the customers health or well being. 

After the few bites of the cheeseteak I had to spend several hours on the thrown in a fiery spew of pain and discomfort, the likes of which I've never seen. My wife almost left me. 

Thank you for the experience. I will NEVER go back.",1.0
"I ordered sushi today, and salmon was spoiled, it was soft and sticky, and really stinky! I called them, and they said that it's supposed to be this way, that it is ""tender"" and in a sticky sauce. But this roll is not even supposed to be in any kind of sauce!!! I am never ordering from them again, after this horrible experience and really bad customer service! I ate 1 piece of spoiled roll and I'm really starting to feel sick, I am afraid  for my health now...",1.0

I haven't tried the other food cart across the other street, Sahara, yet. This is in the Pizza Hut parking lot.  Open late.  I think the best time to get ""fresh"" food is prob. around dinner time when there's alot of people on line.

"I want to start this review by stating that I have never been compelled to ever write a review before; but after receiving my order from Agra King I was thoroughly disappointed. First of all it took an hour and a half to deliver.  (Note- I ordered the food at around 3:45 to avoid a long wait by beating the normal dinner rush.)  I ordered the chicken tikka masala ($11.95), how could you go wrong with that?? Well, they sent me what was basically a pint of tikka masala ""soup"" with six (6) tiny pieces of chicken (for 11.95?!?!), the sixth piece of ""chicken"" was not chicken at all but a piece of white food container mixed in with the container of  the tikka masala ""soup"". After finding the piece of container in my food I felt that the food was not sanitarily prepared, so to avoid wasting it by throwing it away, I fed the chicken tikka masala to my dog (big mistake) who had (explosive) diarrhea shortly after eating it.  Crazy thing is, is that my dog made continuous eye contact with me as she evacuated her bowels on the floor in front of me as if trying to shame me by telling me ""why did you do this to me??  I am supposed to be your best friend??"" I am just glad that I noticed the food container piece while fishing around searching for a piece of chicken in the tikka masala soup before actually eating it myself.

I am not sure what Agra King means in Indo Aryan, but must translate to something in the neighborhood of ""STAY AWAY"".  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day because I am not sure if the other reviewers are talking about the same restaurant.....but 1 1/2 hour delivery, ridiculously small portions and unsanitary food preparation leaves me no other choice than to give them 1 star, and I am pretty sure my dog would rate them less if she knew how to use the computer.",1.0
"STAY AWAY !!!! If I could give ZERO STARS I WOULD! Food poisoning and horrible costumer service!

SHAME ON YOU ! NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN AND AS A NEW YORKER ILL TEL EVERYONE I KNOW NOT TO EAT AT THIS SHITTY PLACE ! The owner is cheap and disrespectful ! ITS TIME FOR NEW YORKERS TO STOP THESE SCAMMERS FROM TAKING OUR HARD EARNED MONEY AMD GIVE US CRAP IN RETURN!",1.0
"I'm bummed because I REALLY wanted to like this place. I love the ambiance, and I love Alsatian food. 

I ordered the grilled salmon, which according to the menu was a pistachio encrusted salmon with a honey mustard sauce over spinach. When it arrived, it didn't seem pistachio encrusted, and the little bit of sauce there was had no flavor. On top of that, the salmon was burnt on the bottom, which overwhelmed any of the other flavors, and it was overcooked. I guess I should have said something, and maybe I would have if anyone had asked, but I just chalked it up to a bad choice on my part.

On top of that, I was very sick to my stomach later, which I didn't automatically attribute to the salmon. I had leftovers the next day (I don't like to waste food), and a few hours later became very ill once again.

Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish on the wrong night, but with so many great restaurants in Carroll Gardens, I don't think I'll be giving La Cigogne a second shot.",1.0

"What's really amazing is that this place has almost 100% bad reviews, and yet they are still in business. I order from Vine when I get desperate. I try to avoid disappointment by ordering the same simple thing over and over again, but even that isn't foolproof with these people. I usually get the same rude delivery guy (for five years now) who grunts like a Neanderthal because he hasn't bothered to learn one word of English, and who again, like a Neanderthal, snatches my tips and gives me a dirty look as if he's insulted before he scurries away into the forest. 

Not only do they have bad service and average to sub-standard Asian fusion food, but recently I noticed that the portions on some of their dishes have been downsized. Downsized portions of crappy food? Now that's balls beyond the size of Jupiter. 

Finally, after reading some reviews here that reported a dead cockroach in someone's soup, two reports of a queasy stomach and food poisoning, and a health department rating of ""C"", I've decided that there is no level of desperation that will make me order from this place again. There are plenty of restaurants in the Columbia area to choose from, so there's no need to play Russian Roulette. In fact, there's a really good authentic Asian place between 103 and 104 on the west side of the street. It's similar to Vine, but minus the roaches, the crappy food, neanderthal delivery guys, bad service, food poisoning, and overall disappointment.",1.0

An anonymous but firm (but not nasty) letter should go out to the owner/management about this; concerning a variety of restaurants in the past I've confronted owners and/or management about getting sick from their respective businesses but it's always met with eye avoidance and denial which is why a letter is generally better; it's all a ""one-way"" conversation.

I ordered the yard bird and it caused me to be sick later on that evening.. not cool. My dinner companion had the Mac and Greens. It's a great idea in theory, however the greens were bitter, making the dish not so great in taste.

"As another reviewer mentioned this is the only Seamless Indian place in Bay Ridge. I had seen the less than stellar reviews but was really craving Indian so thought maybe they were wrong. They are not and I'm so bummed because I love delivery Indian.

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and what I got was a bowl of faded school bus yellow sauce that tasted mostly of cream and oil. The naan was not the fluffy kind I was expecting but seemed more like flour tortillas. It was literally inedible. I called them up and they sent a guy over with a new batch of the exact same crap even though I said I'd rather just a refund because I'd already warmed up leftovers because the oily cream was making me feel sick. 

I called Seamless and they contacted the restaurant that refused a refund and swore that the food was on par. Seriously? I can get better Chicken Tikka Masala from a Trader Joe's frozen meal! No thanks!

Taking a bag of frozen shrimp out of the freezer and putting them in warm water for a few minutes and then cooking it on a flattop isn't safe let alone the proper say to defrost food. Worse case is it got me sick. Dirty lettuce I'm sure isn't the freshest ingredient either. I hope this all changes cause I live close and think the concept and options are good.

I continued consuming it however and was sick all of the next day.  I called a few days later and told them the incident and their response was ""show me the doctor's report"".  Now, I""m not sure what I expected, and usually all it takes is one order of questionable meat and I don't return to a chinese restaurant, but I thought this place would've been at least apologetic!  I will say that when I placed the order it was close to 11 pm, perhaps the meat was lying out for hours before hand.  I'll be looking for a new restaurant.  I would not recommend this establishment.",1.0

"My aunt ordered a pizza to be delivered for my last night in NY. The pizza took a very long time to get there and it was really disgusting. The box was so stained that is how much grease was on the pizza. The pizza crust was uncooked and toppings were raw. The toppings fell right off the crust because it was soaked in so much grease. The Crust tasted awful since it was so soggy and raw. I got sick/food poisoning. 



I have never had a bad pizza in NY before so frankly I am a bit baffled. I feel my aunt should have called to get a refund. However, by the time we got the food everyone was too hungry and it was to late to call back and wait another hour or two for a new pie.  They need to get their act together.

"First time doing takeout here (never ate at the restaurant either). I thought this place would be decent after reading some good yelp reviews. Nope. I was  soooo wrong. Horrible quality. 

I ordered a spicy tuna roll, eel avocado roll, and a shrimp tempura appetizer.  There was barely any spicy tuna in the roll, the eel was too soft and mushy, and the veggie tempuras from the shrimp tempura appetizer was drenched in so much oil that I couldn't finish them (omg, I still feel sick writing this). Blehhh*

Overall,  the food that I ordered was not enjoyable at all. Maybe I ordered too early in the day or maybe I should've dined-in instead of takeout. Who knows. Would I give it a second chance?  Probably not. Too many other sushi joints to try out. I'm putting this one behind me. 

Oh, I ordered at 11:30am if anyone wants to know. They might of used the old tempuras from the night before and refried them.  However, I can't explain the spicy tuna part.",1.0

"After ordering, an acquaintance and I couldn't find any seats, probably because it was a Saturday. We ended up taking our food and walking to a park just to find a place to eat. I took a bite, and I liked it, until I realized that the burger was medium rare, though they didn't ask me how I liked it. I didn't even know they made it any different. I hesitated to continue eating, since I had never had a medium rare burger before, but I continued eating it because it tasted great. 

Afterwards, feeling satisfied with a meal that I liked, we walked around for a bit, but then I wanted to go home because I just started feeling real sick, nausea and stomach cramps.

I know we all make mistakes but Today was the last straw I won't be going back there again the food was horrible and I'm not the type to complain first of all order was all wrong and food was awful.  when I called to Complain he made it seem like that this was what I ordered when I returned the food he originally sent he had the nerve to say I ate more than half the food which was not possible.   we did try to eat the dish but felt sick while eating it.

"THE WORST EVER!!!!!!

Chipotle Mexican Grill is the McDonalds of Mexican food. I'm not even sure why it is Mexican food other than resembling some of the ingredients.

The food is like any fast food chain, comes in pre-made bags from some mega warehouse filled with preservatives and fake flavors.

The steak is cut in perfect squares, all the same size. Looks like dog-food, taste like a fake meat product. The other meat (pork type of slop) is flavorless and gives huge amount of stomach gas.

Beans straight from the can, with no seasoning at all. Raw onions taste like preservatives.

Guacamole is under-ripe and has no flavor. They use lemons instead of lime. The flour tortillas taste like generic store bought, low budget, steamed to a doughy like rubber consistency. Ekkkhh...

Forget about the slow service, workers with attitude, not willing to answer any question, like what comes with the order. Dirty filthy tables, food on the floor, un-emptied garbage. It's way worse than that.... If I owned that place I'd fire everyone just for being jerks!

I can usually find something good about every place I eat. This place NOT ONE - was the worst ever! 

Do not go!!!! Warning, food will make you sick.  

Much better taco on 72 around the corner, on the taco truck on Broadway & 70th, in front of Chase Bank. Yup, that's right the truck taco is  1/2 the price and ten times better!!!!",1.0

I download some pictures for you guys by the way the mean preparation is done on the basement she has tiny room called kitchen that doesn't have the basic requirement of one that's why most of the food is in the floor !!!!

"What can I say, a nightmare dining experience! At one time I would have gladly given  Joya a 4, as I was a frequent diner there over the years, so were many of my friends and family. We have even dined there to celebrate special occasions, but now if I could give them a zero for food quality and service I would! I am now boycotting this establishment and I am recommending that others do the same. 

On Tuesday 12/30/2014, myself and 3 of my friends decided to dine at Joya for lunch and the following happened:

- We entered the restaurant at approximately 2:00 PM and stood in the front to wait to be seated. No one approached us. We had to seek someone out to seat us.
- Waitress approaches to take orders. We decided to only order drinks as we were waiting for the 3rd party.
- Drinks arrive and my friend asked for lemon for his drink, it never came. He had to get up and go to the bar to get his own lemon.
- 3rd party arrives and we are told by the waitress we must order immediately without any explanation. All the while I am observing new customers being seated. So I'm asking myself what's big the rush?
-Waitress hurriedly takes orders in a very impatient and abrupt tone of voice.
- 2 of the appetizers we ordered arrived and were eaten, plates had been taken away by the bus boy when the 3rd one arrived. Had to ask for more plates from the bus boy. Must mention that the place was not even crowded!
-Asked waitress for extra napkins and more plates, they never came, had to ask the bus boy to get them.
-Asked for second round of drinks, waited and waited for them to come. Had to ask the waitress a second time for the drinks.
-It's now approximately 3:00PM, we have eaten, are conversating and finishing our drinks when the waitress rudely plops the check on the table and demands,""pay now!"" Still no explanation as for why the big rush.
- At this point we had had enough of the rude, unwelcoming and rude treatment from the waitress. So, we decide to pay the check and take our leave. I must also mention that in spite of the poor treatment, we still left her a 20% tip!
-Also, around this time we had observed a gentleman come in and unprofessionally proceeded to rag out an employee in the open, in front of customers. We assumed he must be the Manager/Owner of the establishment.
-I asked this person to come over as we were leaving to make him aware of what had happened and complain that as a regular diner, I had never been treated the way I had been by this particular waitress. Rather than apologize and maybe offer us a drink on the house or comp us some of our meal, he proceeded to make excuses for her poor service! He claimed that they close at 3:00, but they were still letting customers in after we arrived! Also, does this mean that diners should be rudely rushed out! Greed was the primary factor here!

Now, I could be wrong, but I did not see a sign indicating as such, nor did I see it on Menu Pages which I had checked the day before. Also, all the waitress had to do from the very beginning was say that this was the restaurants practice. We may have opted not to be seated rather than be rushed through our lunch.

In any case, one word led to another with the manager demanding that we, ""Get the FUCK out of my restaurant, I'm calling the police!"" We welcomed this threat as we had also observed that the Manager seemed to be under the influence. His speech was slurred, he was yelling at the top of his lungs in front of diners, and was extremely confrontational! We waited outside for the police to come, but as we suspected, it was an empty threat.

The poor waitress came running outside behind us apologizing profusely and pleading with us to let the situation drop! We felt sorry for her and any other employee at Joya who has to be subjected to the treatment we witnessed and experienced by this person! I told him that I would be making a review on Yelp and his response was that it didn't matter, he gets 100's of diners in his restaurant! With this kind of service and attitude, I'm not sure how long that will last! If he is not the Owner, we recommend that he be replaced immediately as he is causing Joya to lose business!

I must also mention that after I got home, approximately an hour later, my stomach started bubbling and I ended up sick with diarrhea from eating the food at Joya. I think it may have been the greasy Sping Rolls we ordered as appetizers. Probably old grease! Diners beware! I will be reporting them to the BBB and Consumer Affairs as well!",1.0
"My previous review was mysteriously deleted. But my experience here was so terrible I had to review it again. This place is nasty. You have to pay for your food before it's prepared. I was here about a year ago and ordered a motz tomato basil sandwhich. After 45 minutes it had not arrived. During this time I witness servers chowing down, shoving food down their throats in the main dining room infront of patrons, and then not washing their hands. When I went up to the counter to find out where my sandwhich was, the counter worker had never even bothered to make it. After waiting another 20 minutes for the problem to be corrected, the worst sandwhich i've ever had in my life arrived - bread so stale not even the strongest teeth could bite threw it, ONE slice of cheese so old and dried out, not-yet-ripe tomato slices and ONE piece of basil... for almost $10?? I suffered threw it and regretted it later that night when I was sick to my stomach from it. Food poisoning? Most likely. This place is definitely NOT S'NICE!",1.0

The food looks so delicious in pictures and in person but don't be fooled because its not. As soon as I took the first bite I knew it was horrible food.

"The place is spacious, staff is speedy and friendly, and seating is comfortable.  Great viewing spots along the wall and by the windows.  Large single-stall BRs (1 M and 1 F) in the back.  

-Bowery Burger and Sweet Potato Fries: Huge portions!  Taste: Just OK.  If the burger had been flavorful enough on its own and had more lettuce and tomatoes, I wouldn't have had to drown it in their complimentary special sauces (I went nuts and sampled each!).  The onion rings in the burger tasted more like crispy fried onion bits.  The fries were soggy.  I think the sweet potatoes were too watery to begin with.

-Chili Hot Dog ($5.17): Tasty all beef hot dog (update: until I got REALLY sick from this).  Not on the menu board, but they offer it.  Comes w/ free toppings (grilled onions, sauerkraut, relish, cheese).

Would I come back?  Nah.  Not unless there was another promo that covered my meal again - and I would try a salad, smoothie or shake instead.  To me, extra sauces on anything are just an attempt to cover up and distract from a so-so dish.",1.0

This place opened up in my neighborhood about 2 years ago. I tried it when it first opened service was terrible food not great. Decided 2 years later to return and see if it had improved. The server was nice this time. I ordered a basic salad with chicken and a vinaigrette. It was so bad I took one bite and sent it back. The chicken was like rubber and the dressing tasted expired. When the manager got involved you could tell he was offended and then decided to hover over my table until we left. My girlfriend was with me and her meal made her sick the second we got home. She called to get a refund at which point the manager JD yelled at her and told her he wasn't going to do so. She had to call back 3 times to get someone better on the phone who finally refunded the money and was willing to comp us a meal. We declined the comped meal. This place is so bad I hope it closes and something much nicer opens up in the neighborhood. The upper east side is better then this garbage.,1.0

"Expensive pizza that made me sick. I ordered a single slice and was give a pale looking slice of pizza. It barely looked fully cooked. No worth the buy.

"Great food, til this morning, when my bf couldn't get up for work on the account of being sick. Perhaps it was the bad mushrooms?

"Craaaaap!! complete craaaap. nothing authentic about this place. Nonetheless its not even owned by japanese people, but rather chinese. Sushi/Sashi was not fresh nor the side dishes we had ordered.

"I've enjoyed many drinks and meals here over the years. However, last 3 to 4  times I had a dinner meal here, I got sick with a hacking cough within a day. I won't go back  unless it's just for a beer and to sit at the bar. Otherwise, this is an ok local hangout for St. John's students, but decor a tad on the old-fashioned side. Happy hour prices very affordable. Cash only, no credit cards.",1.0
"If zero stars were possible, I'd give them that. Ordered from seamless, which stated a delivery time of 20-35 min. It came over an hour later. The dumplings were hard & cold & the sushi was warm.

"Tenzan used to be my favorite UWS sushi spot.  It never let me down. 

However the last two delivery orders arrived and portions of my Yellow tail Special were warm. After the first occurrence I was sick for two days. Waited several weeks to try again tonite.  Not as bad as first time but fish freshness was NOT there. I always order miso with no seaweed yet the last two times it was loaded with it.  What gives?  You used to provide stellar service on customer requests.  What happened? 

I feel like something has changed at this once bright spot. Maybe management or supervising the sushi bar?  Whatever it is they need to fix it fast otherwise they won't last.",1.0
"I have been here a few times and enjoyed it. Pizza and kale was all I ever had. The last time I went I ventured and had the roast chicken and banana tart tatin for dessert. The food was delicious (though the tart was a little dry)...but I got violently ill within a few hours of eating it. I called the next day to tell them. The manager was apologetic but offered no compensation (they only take cash. Had I paid with a card, I could have at least disputed the charge). The manager said he would have one of the owners get in touch within a day or two as they were out of town. Never heard from them again. $$ vomitted down the toilet.

Also, when we got there they had a duo playing live music in the main space, not only was it bad music, it was unbearably loud. The manager refused to seat us outside because they only had a four top which they needed to ""save""...even though there were tons of empty tables inside and there was no rush. They turned away two other couples while we were waiting to be accommodated. Finally another couple wanted to sit outside, so they split the four top so we could all sit (but they did it in a really uncomfortable arrangement so that were trapped in by the other table).",1.0

Also, when we paid the bill and split it between cash and a credit, the waiters decided to keep all of the change from the cash we gave ( wish would essentially have been close to a 40% tip ) I found that kind of  much... Even for good service. Besides that the wine was good and the outdoor space is really cute.",1.0

I have a very sensitive stomach I took one bite of the steak and became nauseous! I don't know from what ! I mixed the guac sour cream onions and salsa together w lettuce n tomato into the steak fajita and immediately felt  nauseous after one bite .

"My teenaged daughter and I ate lunch at the Pearl Street venue on Thursday March 19th, 2015. We had visited the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and we were looking for a reasonable place that could accommodate my gluten-free diet. As the place was full, we thought it might be good. The guacamole and chips were good but our entrees were bland. My daughter had the pulled pork tacos and I had the chicken enchiladas. We thought, ok, we won't be eating here again. Then a few hours later after having arrived at our midtown hotel my daughter became violently ill. Since the only thing that I didn't eat that she ate were the pulled pork tacos, we suspect that the dish made her sick.  She spent 2 1/2 hours vomiting. Luckily she recovered and the next day we continued with our tour of the city. If I had more time in the city, I would have reported them to the city health department, but as tourists we were leaving for Toronto on Saturday. Under no circumstances eat here.

My smoked salmon benedict was just ok, the side salad was literally just a handful of leaves and the kitchen forgot to include the melon to be on the side. The food itself probably could get 2 stars though. The thing that really got to me was the Campari drink I got. After having it, I instantly felt dizzy. Not like happy drunk dizzy, but sick dizzy. I went home and fell asleep for two hours, woke up with a bad headache and nausea. I can hold my alcohol and this has never happened before, so I suspect that there was something wrong with the alcohol itself. For making the rest of my Sunday a wash and possibly causing me some kind of poisoning, one star. Unfortunate.",1.0

My family owns restaurants in NYC so I never write on Yelp because I know how annoying it can be for small business owners who really try to provide the best experience that they can. I have the stomach of a goat and almost never get sick from food. I just ordered the Sashimi Deluxe from Hanabi last night and immediately after I was done eating I had aches all over my body. I don't know if they dip their fish in mercury before serving or if they buy their fish from the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan but this stuff is poisonous. I woke up this morning with stomach cramps and my whole body is weak with some aches in my joints. I truly wish I never ordered from these guys... Please take my advice, I know the prices are decent but if you want to eat raw fish please spend the extra buck or you can try these guys and learn the hard way. Anyway, good luck with your Sushi search.",1.0
First of all none of the cooks wear nets or cooking hats on their heads. I ordered a fresh salad from them which had a hair wrapped around the tomatoes/cucumbers and also I ordered Biliyash with meat which tasted exremely old and stale and had a hair BAKED IN the bread! Disgusting. Extremely unsanitary kitchen. Oh and also my husband got a food poisoning from one of their soups and their kebabs. I hope the health department investigates this place and they close down for good.,1.0
"I went to Hide-Chan for my roommate's birthday. I've been there quite a few times over the past three years, and each time my opinion of the place unfortunately declines. I've seen I believe two menu changes since the first time, and last night the menu didn't seem to have an option for broth style, whereas previously you could chose NY Style (less fatty) or the traditional style, but maybe I missed it. They do still allow you to choose noodle style (wavy vs straight) and firmness. 

Hide-Chan's appetizers have been and still are very good. The gyoza is cooked to a very nice, slightly crispy texture and the various flavors are all very interesting. The pork buns (particularly the spicy one) are good, if a bit light on the meat portion. The karaage (fried chicken) is also very good.  The first time I went, I remember they had a sweeter kind of soy sauce in a bottle on the table that was unbelievable with the gyoza, which wasn't there the third time I went back.

They have a lot of interesting ramen choices. I find them all to be a bit bland, but my preferred Ramen style is from a different region I think so that's probably why. Unlike many ramen places, Hide-Chan no longer has a tray of condiments for your ramen (hot sauce, chili peppers, sesame seeds, vinegar, etc, I'm pretty sure we didn't even have a soy sauce bottle on the table, whereas I think the first time I went they even had red ginger out on the table). The bowl is decently sized (though small compared to places like Terakawa and Ramen Misoya, both of which are also cheaper and better). I had the 'Red Dragon' ramen, something I hadn't seen on the menu before. I have pretty serious spicy tolerance so I thought the three-pepper marking on the menu was a bit excessive, but it was the spiciest thing I've ever had there, so that was nice and, in combination with the appetizers, warrants the third star in my rating.

Unfortunately, I started getting stomach cramps a few hours after eating and woke up in the morning with mild food poisoning. This hasn't happened to me before at Hide-Chan so maybe it's just a fluke but it does kinda ruin the experience. The service was decent, our waitress and the hostess were nice but initially it took us forever to be served and staff would walk right by us, even as we sat with our menus closed, no water, looking around expectantly. They were busy but not that busy.

Overall, Hide-Chan isn't a /bad/ ramen spot. But it shouldn't be #1 and I wouldn't go out of my way to go there as someone who lives in the city.",1.0
"I'm giving this place 1 star for 1 reason and 1 reason only.. Their Shrimp Burger. Please for the love of all things Holy, never order any kind of sea food from a burger joint. Literally minutes after I ate this burger I felt sick to my stomach. I ending up getting sick with food poisoning. I don't know if it was the coleslaw or the tartar sauce or the actual shrimp but something wasn't right with that burger. 

The other burgers were fine since no one else got sick. The rest of the food was pretty good. We ordered fried pickles and peppers and nachos. It was nothing special and definitely not worth the prices. 

Besides that, the service was great. We had a great waitress who was very sweet and very pleasant. Also the wait wasn't that bad either. They told us an hour wait and it was a little less than that. 

This place wasn't terrible but they really need to do something with that shrimp burger...",1.0

"Beer selection is the only thing going for this place. I've been 3 times with my girlfriend hoping it improves. The first time was their second night open, so I'm willing to forgive the chaotic service that time, but it's only gotten worse since then. They have dozens of servers and bus boys but they all seem clueless.

The ""nacho fiesta"" was a watery bowl of bean dip and watery pico. 

My $21 steak burrito was so greasy I felt sick from eating it. It was basically just a doughy tortilla filled with beef stir fry. And I was spitting out chunks of charred solid meat. I should have sent it back, but I had already decided never to come back.

My girlfriend's chicken torta was bland and forgettable, but at least it was only $13.

I understand that they are trying to provide beer food and the real attraction is the admittedly impressive draught list, but the food quality is really unacceptable.

"So I have read the reviews and thought I would give it a try . So everything that we ordered was just boring and bland , yes spicy but not much other flavors and very very oily . I noticed some other reviewers mentioned hardly any minced pork in the dishes . My dish had just a little minced pork and was way over oily and later that night I felt sick . The dumplings were the big fat bad ones like you can get in the hundreds of bad take out places around the city .

The crust on the top of the mustard bottle indicates that it was probably older than me. And they literally gave me a empty bottle of hot sauce for no reason and I didn't even ask for it.

We were in NYC Mother's Day and my wife wanted to eat at Eataly however the place was mobbed and the wait seemed too long to justify it with 3 hungry teenagers. Being Manhattan there's great places everywhere. So we went a little further down the block and this place only had one table going in the outdoor seating...that should have been our red flag. We chose it because it was available and we were hungry.

We were seated in the rear dining area and were the only people in the place. The same ridiculous 5 European-Techno songs were playing a little too loud and without a break.

We got some drinks in a reasonable amount of time, made our food order and waited...and waited and waited some more. About 40 minutes in total with nothing. The music was extra irritating by now. What started out as City Chic was like a soundtrack to a bad movie. My kids wanted to leave - I should have listened. Mind you all this time it sounded like there were 3 people in the kitchen cutting, chopping, frying...amazing how much activity with no production was going on during our 45 minute wait.

My wife and I were discussing the cutoff time that we would leave. With about three minutes to spare the food arrived. My my main course with my appetizer side by side 40-somethiing minutes later.

OK, so we're off to bad start, but at least the food is here. It's Mother's Day, happy times....not quite. As we start to dig in to the meal one of my kids pulled a nice long black hair out of his chicken cutlet. The slowness, crazy music and now the hair. It kind of puts a damper on the mood. I got the manager and she came over and apologized and said that she would make him a fresh order. Then she came back a minute later with the same dish trying to explain to my son that it was cheese he saw and not hair. Then he showed her the hair out he pulled out because it was still on the table cloth. She verified it was a hair and since he's blonde there was no dispute. She apologized and came back in under 5 minutes with what I think was fresh ""hair-less"" replacement order.

Well maybe it was a good value you might ask. Nope. Expensive related to what we ordered. 

The bonuses...we got to see who the hair belonged to as we exited the restaurant. A nice looking chef with long black hair smoking outside the kitchen door. The real bonus was that I felt ill on the way home from the food. I usually don't write reviews on anything good or bad, but it's nearly 11pm and I still feel sick from 3pm meal. Stay away from this place. It is absolutely atrocious.",1.0
"I came here last night on a date with my man...and I was very excited to eat some steak!!!  I left sick and hungry.  

Let me start with the positives:
- Frango Ipanema.  Chicken with passion fruit sauce.  YUMMMM.  Cooked perfectly.  Very flavorful (This is the only reason I've given 2 stars) and warm enough.
- I love the decor and how they have used the space
- Great seat by the window
- Nice music that wasn't too loud
- Plantain chips brought to table were yummy
- Red wine (plus one on the house for below steak incident)
- Herb fries were good, but a little undercooked

Now for the negatives:
- The steak!  :(  I ordered the skirt steak, at the waiter's recommendation and I asked for med/rare-rare.  It came out well done and cold.  I sent it back and asked for rare.  What I got was RAW and cold.  I couldn't bring myself to send it back again (Or eat it).  The potatoes and asparagus that it came with were also not hot or cooked enough.  I just figured I would go home and cook it properly....that didn't happen.  This $22 steak became cat and dog food.
- Pao de queijo - mushy, bland, and overall bad
- The ginger ale.  It tasted like seltzer w/ a hint o' ginger ale.  The worst I've ever had.
- The way my tummy felt last night and tonight.  That was my only food yesterday, but i could not eat when i got home last night.  and i can't eat again now.
- It took forever to get the bill.  Our babysitter called and wanted us to come, but getting the check took about 15 minutes.

I was going to go with 2 stars, but now reading over these negatives again, I'm bumping it down to 1.  I wouldn't recommend this place.",1.0
"We ate at Fonda last night and I have been sick ever since - I had the chicken!
I thought that the headache I started getting almost immediately after we finished was due to the tequila shot I had - the one that was "" highly"" recommended by waiter who by the way neglected to tell me that it was $16 a shot!
The food didn't taste that great going in and it is far worse coming out!!!",1.0
"Definitely the worst restaurant i have ever been to in every aspect. 

Service -  I made reservations for a large party (20+), but the rude hostess and manager would not seat us because 2 people were 10 minutes late looking for parking. They threatened to give our table away if they didn't show up in another 5 minutes. Completely ridiculous. After our meal, we brought dessert for a birthday celebration, and as we were about to eat it, we got scolded by the manager. We just gave them $1,000 worth of business, and the manager yelled at us like we were 5 years old for having dessert for our birthday party. This manager needs to be fired. Even the waiters apologized to us on his behalf as we were storming out. 

Food - There are way better thai restaurants out there. Try cafetasia, ngam, or any other restaurant for that matter. Pad thai was way too sweet. You're better off eating a bowl of sugar. Seafood noodles gave me diarrhea. Curry was bland. Duck was dry. Nobody in our group liked their food. It is pretty impressive that you can disappoint all 20 people in one party. 

Price - We spent about 50 dollars per person for terrible service and food. For that money, i would expect to be treated with respect, but instead, the power crazed manager treated us like garbage. You can get better thai food for a third of this price almost anywhere else. 

Conclusion - STAY AWAY FROM HERE unless you enjoy paying an excessive amounts of money for a night of scolding and diarrhea. FIRE THE MANAGER.",1.0
"Pretty sure I got a mild case of food poisoning after eating here last night. I ate the pickles on the table, a hot pastrami sandwich and a side of potato salad. It was crowed and the services was blunt but the food tasted good while I was eating there. Around midnight I didn't feel well at all and lets just say the meal didn't stay in my stomach all night.

"THE FISH WAS RANCID AND MADE ME SICK.

I ordered soup and a tilapia dinner for delivery from Mee-Thai. After taking a few bites of the fish, I noticed a strong smell. Immediately after, I began vomiting. As soon as I was able, I called Mee-Thai to tell them about the rancid food. Their reaction was startling. They refused to give me a refund because they argued I had eaten the food (a few bites of the tilapia, which is what I believe made me sick). 

More importantly, they never apologized or stated they would stop serving the tilapia to customers that night. Upon my insistence, they stated they would issue a refund - unsurprisingly, I received no refund or notification of refund. There are so many better options for Thai food in the area. This place is a health and safety risk.",1.0

"No other way to say it, but this food was sickening. It just about ruined our night. We had plans to go out in the area afterward but we were so nauseated that we decided to forego everything else until we felt better.

Another thing you should know is that this place is nowhere near cheap. We have the receipt to prove this if you don't believe it, but two (2) ribs, some broccoli and a handful of the worst sauerkraut I've ever had was $20. 

I used to live a couple doors down from this place back before the glass condos went up. Maybe the folks at Fette Sau don't like all the yuppies that have moved in and decided the quality of what they were once doing wouldn't be respected enough to make it worth putting in the effort anymore, but back when I was in the neighborhood I loved this place. Couldn't stay away. How the mighty have fallen.",1.0
"For some reason my review was removed. Here is some more ""details about my customer experience"".

So I learned my lesson. After two tummy aching episodes, stick to the drinks and good bar convos. -The clam chowder has its moments however it's not consistent on freshness. Drinks are always on point. The bartenders do a great job in listening to the customer and delivering. For extra unnecessary details my two food poisoning moments were unpleasant for me, a customer, to experience and warranted a review on my behalf. As there are many other seafood establishments in this area, not only is this to bring awareness to those who will like to dine here, but a reminder to myself that overall I'd have to say this is a hard pass.",1.0

Monday I went and the chicken tasted off/bad to me so I threw most of the salad away and as it turns out - I have food poisoning!  Now that I think back on it about a year ago I got some sort of chowder soup that made me very sick but I didn't know if it was food poisoning or the amt of fried food/alcohol I consumed later that evening.  Well, now I know!  Steer clear!",1.0

I will still give this place 3 stars because the seekh kababs and chicken tikka are pretty awesome. Call ahead for the chicken tikka as they make it fresh for you and it takes about 15 minutes to make.",1.0
"If you don't mind diarrhea dine at Sing Huang
I'm not the only one see Tina C's review
I ordered Scallion Ginger Lo Mein and said I like big pieces of ginger.
There were no pieces of ginger in it. It had a lot of scallion shreds and only a slight bit of ginger flavor. 
The Lo mein wasn't typical Lo mein noodles. It was the thinner egg noodles and it was sitting in a watery sauce. It was delivered to my table with suspicious speed. 
It came with a soup that I was told was vegetable. It was a plain broth with nothing in it. I am a vegetarian but I didn't say so. It could have been chicken broth but I'm not sure. It was salty and boring. The place is small and somewhat dark. 
I much prefer the restaurant next to it Excellent Dumpling House (food is good but also no atmosphere)  but now they have signage that it so huge there is not even a window, just pictures of the dishes ridiculously big. Sing Huang has the same thing. Eight foot food ads have replaced the window. It's obnoxious the whole store front wall is covered.

I can't say this always is reliable but if you are looking for a place to eat in Chinatown walk in the door and if there are not several tables with Chinese people eating at them walk back out. 
Sing Huang also has a secret ""on rice"" menu (not on the menu) with lower prices for the Chinese. Mention ""on rice"" or you are going to get the more expensive portion for two, the one for the tourists. 
I was at Sing Huang once before and the vegetables seemed to be fresh but probably due to excessive MSG I had two watery d's afterward (see first sentence)

"Me and my friend went here bc we heard it was a good place. We arrived and there was no one in there, so we thought that was weird. Then we ordered chicken tacos, bacon, and guacamole and chips, (all very expensive for the portions and taste!!) first we got our guacomle and chips and it was just normal tasting, the chips were stale though, and a very small portion for 9 dollars. Then the chicken tacos came. I don't mean to be rude but they were gross. Me and my friend both hated it, we barely ate any of them so we decided to take them home for my mom to eat. They forgot our bacon so we had to ask again, and it came. It was expensive plus not even that good(once again). Then it came to pay the check, it was expensive for what we got (I forgot the exact price) and by mistake i gave a 16 dollar tip. So we took the chicken tacos back home but they didn't make it home. They smelled so bad that we had to throw it out. And I felt sick, probably from that bite of the tacos. In the end, idk if it was the things we ordered but we did not like the place.",1.0

"I've been coming here for a while now. The food is pretty darn good and the prices are very fair. The only issue I have is the food always gives me stomach pains and makes me run to the bathroom. Sorry guys, but it's the truth and you should know. 

My husband has the same issue. Once, We actually timed it to see if it was their food and let's say thank goodness we have two bathrooms at home. He continued to eat from here until he got the worse pain in his stomach and refused to eat here again. He was in denial until then. We thought it can't be food poison because it's not a constant running to the bathroom issue.

I don't know if it's an ingredient they use or what but we took a long break from eating here. The last time I ate here about two months ago, my chicken with rice had pieces of bone fragments which grossed me out. 

Overall the food is good and the place looks clean. Anyone had the same stomach pain issue?",1.0
"Manhattan is filled with awesome places to spend lots of money on great drinks. Usually that's fine by me. $14 for a cocktail is about average in Manhattan, maybe cheap even, but the value is so bad here, that you just feel taken advantage of. I'm not entirely sure what the reviews here are talking about, but the drinks are horrendous. We were a group of 4 and we had 4 different drinks, none were notable (the egg nog might have even gotten my friend sick). The wait on a Sunday night was about 20 minutes but I'm not factoring that into my review since I've waited over an hour to get into places before. The only comment regarding the wait that I'll make is that typically the wait indicates that the place is worth it, that wasn't the case here. Beyond the drinks, the decor was cheesy and underwhelming, straight out of the dollar store. The one good thing is that the staff was quite friendly, but no level of friendliness can save this place. Save your money and go elsewhere. The novelty of a Christmas bar is not worth it if this is the result.",1.0
"Do not eat here.

We went with a coupon for a free round of margaritas and still left feeling like we got ripped off.

Its a Mexican restaurant in Forest Hills giving out free margarita coupons so our expectations were extremely low going in. Our expectations were appropriate. Or maybe too high still.

The food is mediocre. The service is chain restaurant standard. Except no free refills and it takes a few asks for a glass of water. Refills on soda are $2.

We had 3 round of margaritas so you would think we would leave feeling happy and buzzed. Instead we were grossly underwhelmed...almost on the verge of feeling cheated...enough so, to make me dust off my old Yelp account and comment, in hopes I can deter a few of you away from this waste of your time and money. Take the subway to Roosevelt/Jackson Heights for much more authentic and affordable fare.

The fajita special listed at $16 came out as $21 on the bill. My vegetarian friend wanted no meat in her enchilada so she got charge $19 instead of $13, the price of my chicken enchiladas. When we asked the waiter to fix the price twice, after 20 min he was able to reduce her disgusting carrot filled enchilada down to $15. Customer service at its finest.

I could say more. But I'm tired of writing and am done paying this place any attention. Bottom line is, SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

"Had a very negative experience at sushi Yasuda, although the sushi is great there.  It was my wife's birthday last night and she had never been before.  The meal started off with excellent sushi.  But about 30 minutes in, a fight broke out between 2 tables.  They were yelling and screaming at each other and the restaurant couldn't calm them down.  This went on for at least 15 minutes.  Then they finally get one table to leave, but the other wouldn't - and they kept being loud.  It seemed the restaurant was afraid to kick them out. Frankly, they did a terrible job to control the situation.  Finally, they left when they felt like it - but dinner was thoroughly ruined.  We asked for a check while this was going on and it took forever to get it. Then the bill was still $250.  After such a negative experience at a nice restaurant, you'd think the restaurant would do more to make it right.  Then after everything, I got sick today and feel like it must have been the sushi.  Will not be going back.",1.0
"Horrible sushi. I was there on Sunday for dinner. I figure I haven't ate here for awhile, so why not. TERRIBLE MISTAKE. The rice wasn't even Japanese rice.. It was barely cooked.  The sushi was not fresh, they were rather questionable. I had food poisoning for 2 days now. I used to go there all the time. The quality of their sushi changed a lot. BUT the COOKED food was decent. I will never go back to this place if i want to eat sushi.",1.0
"Two Words to describe this place.... HELL NO!! I'm being honest as possible. I came here today with my grandmother & daughter for brunch. I always said wherever there is slow, dumbass people working at an establishment, it is going to be bad. Anyways, we came in and were seated with the hostesses looking lost & mind you it's early in the day. It was practically empty!!! Once we were seated, we already knew what we wanted to eat.
After a long wait, the bartender who was yapping her life away at the bar came to our table. We ordered and the food was mediocre. THEY ALSO DISCRIMINATE at this restaurant clearly because the Spanish waiter only went to people that appeared to be his kind. I'm not racist TRUST ME but I know what I saw. He came to two tables which he tended to and asked at least 3x if they were ok and needed anything. You think our waitress did that? NOPE!

After that, I was annoyed. I had the worst attitude. Our waitress(which was the bartender) was smiling, thinking she did a pretty good job or at least thought she was getting a tip.... She thought wrong! Paid the bill and left never to return to this place. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS! I wish my experience was better but it wasn't. I will always stick with my Olive Garden in Westbury.

& BTW leaving the restaurant, my daughter started feeling sick. Half an hour later, she threw up the food I kid you not. That was a RED FLAG for me, so I'm DEFINITELY NOT coming back.

And dude was nice, so I was okay with it. 

Second time I got oxtail, rice and beans. Oxtail was not trimmed at all. It all tasted bad. I rarely toss food, but after stomaching the oxtail and a few bites of rice and beans with extra hot sauce, I threw it out. I can't help but wonder, who is cooking back there?  And the icing on this awful cake, I got sick. Sluggish, lay down then run to bathroom type sick.  This was my first time  getting sick from eating cooked food. No bueno.

"I have never written a Yelp review before but this experience was so bad I felt I had to. The service was horrible and the food ranged btw sub-par to terrible, the chopped salad looked like something you'd find at the bottom of a hampster cage and tasted the same.The 'all you could eat mussels' we ordered (and had to keep asking for repeatedly) as an app came at the end of our meal (fishy and not fresh) and the burgers were burnt. Over the course of an hour and a half I had to keep asking for the wine I ordered in the beginning only to be told after my meal that they didn't have it - asked for a different glass of wine, a half hour later they said they didn't have that either! When I asked if they had Pinot Grigio the server said ""What's Pinot Grigio?"" You're charging a fortune for this terrible food and your waitstaff doesn't know what a Pinot Grigio is? 

We were so unhappy and complained to the manager (also something I've never done) and he comped some food- which was nice of him. But t it really was the worst dining experience I have ever had. My family has been in the restaurant business for over 30yrs, I have waited tables and worked in kitchens. There is no excuse for what happened and they should feel ashamed for charging people that much money for their food and unqualified service. I have a lot of patience and respect for the food indusrty but this was horrendous.

"Worst food poisoning of my life!!!

I came in around 9 on Friday and opted for the Room Service Pad Thai with shrimp, per a colleague's suggestion. The friendly though slightly incompetent bartender promptly brought out a steaming plate of noodles wrapped in egg. My mouth watered and I proceeded to devour the entire portion over the next 40 minutes.

Upon waking the next morning, my first thought was of the first officer from Alien. Anticipating what was to come, I hobbled to the bathroom where I spent the next few hours curled in various positions around the toilet, vomiting my guts out. Around 5 that evening was able to keep down tap water again. The weekend was a complete writeoff.

"Boy oh boy. From the outside La Defense seems like a promising sit down lunch/happy hour/dinner spot. The menu seems decent also with 3 types of mac-n-cheese, quiches, burgers and salads. The prices also seem reasonable with a classic mac-n-cheese with a house salad of less than $10. Look over to two tables next to us and the mac-n-cheese also looks appetizing. 

And that's all the good this place has. 

My coworker ordered the classic mac-n-cheese and I got the wild mushroom truffle oil mac-n-cheese for $1.5 more. Both of the orders came with house salad. The mac-n-cheese comes in a container that you would make french onion soup in and the salad was barely dressed. The most disappointing, however, was the mac-n-cheese. First of all, there was barely any mushroom in my mac-n-cheese. I could not taste the mushroom or the truffle oil. In fact, there is no flavor in the mac-n-cheese at all. It seems like they didn't even bother to put salt and pepper. The mac-n-cheese was extremely watery instead the cheesy and gooey-ness that a proper mac-n-cheese should be. You can get much better mac-n-cheese from Hill's Country Country about five minutes away.

-spagetti: bland, uninspiring.

"I had food poisoning after eating here.  The bread were stale and they used very low quality oil for it.  After leaving this place, I was constantly burping with the stale oil that was sitting in my stomach. 

We ordered a salad as appetizer, it was saturated with salt and vinegar, and it wasn't even mixed evenly.  Some part tasted more vinegary, other parts tasted more salty. 

Ordered 4 other plates: gnocchi, soup dumplings, market fish, and some spaghetti dish.  

Each dish was super small, about 8 gnocchi and ""soup dumpling"" in each plate.  Gnocchi had chili pepper in it which I wasn't a big fan of.  The spaghetti dish had nothing but tons of pepper in it, almost too much pepper. Fish tasted fishy, for a very small piece of fillet.

My friend and I ordered appetizers -- the sweet potato fries are great -- and decided to share the Cutie Duckling as an entree (completely overpriced). The entree was lackluster and disappointing; this, by itself, is generally not enough to make me write a one-star review. But, we both got sick from the entree and spent the next 2 hours with extreme nausea. 

Furthermore, when I wrote to Ngam to inform them of my experience, the management was initially very helpful and offered me a refund.

They have speciality foods like sunflower and quinoa milk & a baby section of jarred foods & special baby items like natural teething gel. You can basically find anything healthy here.

My husband and I tried to be nice and sympathise with the waitress but our patience was severely tried when we still didn't have our order after waiting for over an hour! They didn't bring any drinks, including water until we reminded them several times. It seems our order got lost and therefore after two other staff asked ""have you already had your food?"" (Seriously?!) they finally confessed that there had been a breakdown in communication...quite. The staff were clearly frazzled and were not taking ownership of the tables. There was no clear management or leadership and the staff didn't even know eachother's names...not sure if this was a one off but seemed a very odd way to run a business.
When the food finally arrived my ""Italian panini"" was not as described on the menu...it was missing at least two of the key ingredients and tasted solely of balsamic vinegar. I finally managed to flag down a member of staff who seemed perplexed as to my issue with the meal. He went off to get a side dish of one of the missing ingredients and thought that would solve it...it did not. They took it back to the kitchen and then decided they didn't have everything needed to make it afterall and offered me an alternative. By now I was seriously hungry so I ordered the chicken noodle soup...it came quickly but was standard stuff and had two tiny curls of pasta (not noodle?!) in the whole bowl (hardly noodle soup me thinks!!)
My husband's burger was the worst he's tasted but he was so hungry he ate as much as he could stomach...too much it seems as it gave him food poisoning! 
Needless to say, we will never return and I would caution anyone who values their health, time or food to avoid at all costs!
The worst restaurant in NYC!",1.0
This place absolutely nasty. I have seen bath room cleaner then this place. My friend worked here and show me pic of the kitchen an i nearly threw up. I here that they let the burgers turn gray and the stakes. Once i went there an i went to use the bathroom while i was waiting on my food an found a condom in the toilette. The food is also nasty it made me sick. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN,1.0
"WARNING!!! I've bought meat from this place and gotten really sick. 



The whole meat section needs be cleared out and cleaned. It has an awful smell and I can't tell the good meat from the bad meat. So essentially it's all bad. 



I thought buying the freshest packaging would be a safe bet. But diarrhea for a week is not worth it. 



This was one occasion. On another occasion my husband came and bought over $100 worth of meat and veggies. We had a BBQ. Everybody was sick. 



I was sick for two weeks from eating the food purchased from food bazaar. So my warning is to BEWARE what you buy here because you might end up on the toilet regretting it for weeks. Like I did.",1.0
"Don't put yourself through this. We ordered from here through seemless last night. After the estimated delivery time came and went I called to see where our food was and was informed that the guy had already left with it. Great... After another half an hour I tried calling again, and they couldn't be bothered to answer the phone. So I called seemless and cancelled the order. Ten minutes later, the guy finally shows up, almost an hour after the time we were quoted. Immediately the restaurant calls me and says now we still have to pay. Well, I'm not one to pay for a pile of cold uncooked dough. The lady on the phone was rude right from the start so I retuned the attitude. She offered to come pick up the food, I said I didn't have another two hours to wait for her. Then she just put the phone down in the restaurant and quit talking me. Nice. Anyways, I tried eating a few bites of the calzone and am now paying for it by waking up at five in the morning with my guts wrenched up. If you're looking for a place to serve you food poisoning with a shitty attitude, you've found it. One the other hand, Charles from seemless was very polite and helpful and refunded our order. If the lady from the restaurant still wants to come pick up the food, it's all nicely thrown in the dumpster, please come get it back before some poor bum decides to poison him self too.",1.0
"No no no. Heard about this vegan spot & decided to order the buffalo chicken sandwich & chocolate cupcake. My palms itched in anticipation & mouth watered as I looked through pictures of the food they had. Alas, 1:30 pm comes around, & I dash out of the office like a child on the last day of summer school. I arrive at Terri, grab my goodies, & head back to the office. Upon opening the cupcake, I see that it's much smaller than what's pictured on the site. Also, the icing has turned into a gloopy mess & completely fallen off the cupcake. I take a bite anyway & am majorly disappointed. The cupcake is so thick & bready-not moist at all. It literally absorbs all the moisture in my mouth & the icing is just gross. I knock back a swig of water and bravely move on to the next food item- the buffalo chicken sandwhich on rosemary focaccia bread. My heart beats nervously as I remove the container from the paper bag. I open the container. Pull out the sandwich...& my hands are filled with soggy bread. The bread is completely mushy from the tomatoes & vegenaise which together has created a gross coagulated liquid. Also there is oil that is drenched on the sandwich. The final act? The mock chicken is gray & tastes so bland, that I briefly considered licking my combat boots to see if they were made of the same material. BUT WAIT- there's MORE.
After eating the bit that I can, my stomach begins to twist and turn. I make it through the work day and head home. I lay on my bed and cringe as the stomach pain worsens. All of a sudden my eyes spring open as I feel a bubbling sensation in my bowels. I spring out of bed & into my bathroom just in time to SH*T bricks and VOMIT. 
This was the only meal I'd eaten all day. As a matter of fact this was the only meal I'd eaten in the last 24hours.

Moral of the story? Bring a salad for lunch.
Will not return and will tell all of my vegan minions to stay away. God bless.",1.0
"2 stars ONLY because the service was great. Made reservations 2 months prior and despite the packed restaurant only had to wait 10 minutes. Our waiter was great too. The food eh, the drinks okay. 

However, the next morning I got extremely ill. The last time I got this violently sick to my stomach was in 2002 so....you put two and two together.",1.0
"NEVER AGAIN. This place is disgusting. I ordered once and it was pretty bad, but I decided to give them a second chance. I have never regretted a decision so deeply.

I got a Tuna Bolo wrap with pepperochinis  delivered to my office. I asked for mayo packets on the side. I didn't get any. Not a big deal. What IS a big deal is the fact that the brown paper bag my sandwich was in REEKED of cigarette smoke. The delivery guy must have been smoking while he was out making deliveries. I am not okay with that at all. Second, my wrap was dripping wet, from whatever unnecessary amount of juices were in my wrap. And I mean it was SOAKED. soaked through the wrap, through the foil, through the paper bag, into a PUDDLE in the plastic bag. Finally, the tuna tasted rancid. Like it has been sitting out at room temperature for a week. I had 2 bites (just to make sure. I don't know why.) Unsurprisingly, I got sick about 2 hours later, vomiting in my office. 

I called them to explain, hoping for a refund. They offered me a) a second tuna bolo wrap, (NO THANKS) or a store credit. No refunds.

I will never order from here again, and I advise you not to, either.",1.0
I've been at this restaurant several times and after each time I dislike it more than the last. I got food poisoned the last time I was here. The service has alwaysss been bad here which isn't anything surprising. They always forget to put your order in and then make you wait forever without an apology (happened 2 out 2 times this past month). The soup dumpling has gone down the hill too. I don't think I'll ever come back after getting food poisoned. Sticking to Joe's Shanghai.,1.0

"We loved when this place opened not too far from us, as they had good bagels and sandwiches at a then reasonable rate (plus they did great French Toast bagel.) 

Today we returned in the morning, I didn't wish to spend too much but wanted a little breakfast bite.  My wife just wanted one of their French Toast bagels plain, I was going to have one too with just a little bit of butter, but my eye caught a counter sign saying, ""try our new whitefish salad,"" & I asked if I could, instead of butter, have ""a little of the Whitefish salad smeared on instead.""

It was not bad tasting, he told me pay when we were done, then said it came to $9.56.

I really felt that was a bit of a rip-off. I didn't get much salad on the bagel (which was fine, since that was what I indicated,) but for that & a 2nd bagel with nothing, seemed ridiculous.

Plus (keeping in mind I had not eaten anything else that morning) when we got home, I had to run to the bathroom and was sick for hours.",1.0
"I feel strange giving Harry's 3 stars as I expected so much more out of it. Although the service is great, the food is just ok. in fact, I am pretty sure that I had the seared tuna for lunch and had to leave work almost immediately after due to food poisoning, I didn't eat anything else after my lunch, so I can confidently say that it was the tuna from Harry's that made me ill. However, it IS a decent lunch spot to go to during the work week. Comparable to Bobby Van's -- but generally people like one place better than the other ...",1.0
DO NOT EAT HERE. The food made me sick!! I ordered chicken tikka masala and naan. The naan was okay. the chicken tikka masla was terrible. It tasted like the horrible cooking cubes you can buy from the store. I then woke up in the middle of the night sick. Save your money and stomach!,1.0
"Well. I had a case of food poisoning after eating the takeout sushi here last Friday (3/27). I think the restaurant needs to be consistent with the freshness of their fish. Until then, I will not order or visit the place.",1.0
"I came in here with a coupon from the Pancake Revolution thing or whatever. My waiter told me I couldn't use it because the address wasn't there telling me that usually when the address isn't there it means people have whited out the address trying to commit fraud to get some free pancakes. I was confused because that was just how the manufacture sent it to me and I showed them the original email which was also missing the address (which I remember putting in when I signed up) but she said I still couldn't do it because it was company policy. But whatever right? Technicalities. It happens, who cares? 

Kinda lost my appetite after that so I sat with my friends while they ate. I didn't have anything all day so I ordered a glass of water with a lemon in it since my friends were splitting the bill and I didn't have any change small enough to not make it a pain in the ass to divide it later. 

I don't know if they didn't wash the cup, I don't know if they dropped the lemon on the floor, or if something worse happened. I know too many people who work at restaurants to not think something went down behind the counter. That cup of lemon water was literally the first thing I had to eat/drink all day. I started coughing about 10 minutes after drinking maybe 1/3rds of the water. My throat started feeling like I drank pushpins instead of water. Twenty minutes in and I started coughing up red mucus. It's not even a little bit, its been coming in freaking chunks and its all fleshy and gross. I've never been this sick in my life. It was fucking bizarre. I took some NyQuil when I got home but its only gotten worse. 

My friends went to the bathroom and left me their money so I could wave down the waiter to collect. It's a pretty small-ish restaurant but it took 20 minutes until they finally came back to collect. 

Right before we left two of my friends who actually ate realized that they only got their bills and didn't get any change, only their bills. It wasn't that big a deal, maybe around seventy-five cents was missing in total; I pulled them out of there before any more bolder ""incidents"" could happen. 

The oldest person at the table was 17 and it wasn't me. I thought it was kind of messed up that fully grown maybe 30-something adults would pull something like this because they were annoyed at the coupon thing or something.",1.0
"I have been there twice now and have felt sick after eating the food. I love great Indian food and frequently eat Indian cuisine so I know the difference between good and bad Indian food. This is just terrible. The curry in the chicken tika lacks the proper spices and flavors, the naan is consistently stale, the samosas are dried out, and the basmati rice is cold. Also, I always feel terrible after eating the food. They need to work on the quality of food to have me back as a customer.",1.0
"I'm a pescetarian, so I wasn't expecting much when my cousin invited me to the chain restaurant Dallas BBQ. He ordered a massive pile of wings, my friend ordered a cheese burger and I ordered the poached salmon.

My cousin was thoroughly satisfied with his wings. They were huge and deep fried, but I have a suspicion that they are pre-cooked and frozen. 

My friend's burger and fries was a mess of grease and oil. Literally, there was grease pooling at the bottom of his pile of fried onion strings. He seemed satisfied, but ultimately felt sick towards the end of the meal. I had to finish his beer.

My salmon came with some kind of spinach salad and potatoes. The potatoes were frozen. I understand they're supposed to be served ""cold"", but they were actually frozen solid. So was my salmon. The waiter assured me that that's the way it's prepared, but...he's wrong. Cold poached salmon is a common thing, but the fish itself was so frozen that there was still a visible layer of frost when I tore a chunk off with my fork. I sent it back and ordered the cod instead. The cod was a pre-cooked mess, obviously frozen beforehand. The salad served with it was a bland mass of lettuce, green peppers and a cherry tomato or two. 

The dill sauce served with the poached salmon was rather tasty, however, and made the cod fish sticks palatable.

I suppose I shouldn't expect much from a place called ""Dallas BBQ"" when I'm not particularly interested in BBQ or fried chicken wings, but if you're going to have alternatives on the menu they should at least be moderately palatable. In Manhattan particularly, why someone would choose to go to a half-rate chain restaurant instead of the literally thousands of worthwhile alternatives is beyond me.

It was relatively cheap though, so there's that.

TL;DR version: If you want cheap BBQ, I guess Dallas BBQ is the place for you. If you want GOOD BBQ, go somewhere else. If you don't have an interest in BBQ at all, then you have no reason for eating here.",1.0
"Ambience was wonderful with the exception of smelling a constant whiff of garbage from outside of the restaurant. 

As for food, Mac n cheese varieties were underwhelming and had too much cheese on top. Tuna tartare was half decent, and spinach artichoke dip was also average at best. Tuna steak was overcooked and the prosciutto was too salty. Brussels sprouts were too salty. Beef and broccoli had NO broccoli at all and tasted nothing like an Asian dish whatsoever. 

Service was poor and our waitress was a bit MIA the entire evening. 

My stomach is churning 5 hours later; I hope I didn't get food poisoning, but wouldn't be surprised if I did.",1.0
"Why is it every time I eat from the salad bar at Open Kitchen I get diarrhea? Could it be the dirty kitchen, or the hordes of office workers who crowd round the tables, perhaps dirtying the place.

It had that fake strawberry taste and a slimy consistency... McDonalds makes a better milk shake. But that's not the worst part... Within minutes I was writhing in agony, and I had to rush home to use the bathroom. Shortly upon arriving home I was clutching my knees over the toilet, hoping for the best. A most unpleasant fluid issued forth from deep within my butt. It had an uncanny resemblance to a milkshake consumed not long prior (It had an unmistakable pink hue). After straining for the better part of an hour, my body had expelled every drop of that horrible liquid from my body and I made an astonishingly quick full recovery with the poison no longer in my system.",1.0

"Placed an order one night this week.  We ordered fried red snapper and shrimp Tom Yum Soup. When the food arrived, the fried snapper was soggy, unseasoned and under cooked. The sauces that accompanied the fish were on the side, thank goodness because they were disgusting.  

The Ginger and Lard Prig (spicy garlic chili sauce) sauces.  Spicy Garlic chili sauce was nasty..sweet more than spicy with a horrible after taste, nothing fresh about a sauce out of a can.  The ginger tasted like dirt.

The soup tasted like oyster mushrooms and the shrimp were over cooked, tiny and not fresh.  They only added 3 shrimps for an extra $3.00.  Asian bowl up the block adds Jumbo shrimp for way less and the soup is way tastier.

You would think that an $8.00 soup they would at least use jumbo shrimp. 

My wife got sick, stomach cramps..... What? followed by nausea almost immediately and she didn't even finish her dinner. The bill was $65 (two fried very small snappers and two small soups) go figure!

 My $12.00 soup wasn't even hot. I tried my other friends' Pastrami Reuben and it tasted stale and disgusting.  - Def. NOT fresh ingredients used in any of their foods.

My martini came and it was already being spilled on the way over. It was spilled all over the table once he managed to set it down - in front of the wrong person, of course. Moved it to me - and more was spilled. The only nice thing was that he took my joke of ""you should give me more because you spilled half of it"" seriously and brought me more .  The guy was friendly  - but once our food was at our table, he never came back to check.
 
The staff disappeared halfway through our  meal. We actually almost decided it was a perfect opp. to dine and dash because they wouldn't have even noticed. We kept yelling ""HELLO?"" because we wanted our check. It took them 20 mins. to actually come back from wherever they were.
 and don't get me wrong - i've actually never dined and dashed before - but this meal was so bad; that I considered it. over-priced/bad. not a good combo.

I still come here when I need to pick up certain groceries because it's so close to my apartment. It's not exactly cheap and I would be here much less if my favorite Korean produce mart on Roosevelt hadn't shut down.

On top of the bad service, I puked up my lunch. It was gross and disgusting.

"wanted to like this place, brought a group of friends. Food: the lobster looked a lil funky, it wasn't Maine lobster, it was from Canada I think. It tasted a lil funky as well, i thought it was a great deal, big lobster w/fries for $20 but i actually felt pretty sick about an hour after I ate and had the runs. They gave me a red gimmick lobster cracker but it didn't work so i couldn't get the meat out of the claws, very annoying. They took it back to crack it for me but still didn't do it right so I lost about 20% of the meat.  Decor;  cool looking place, kind of too open & light and not that warm.  Service: waitress tried jamming the check down our throats 2 or 3 times, was very uncomfortable, we had just ordered more drinks.  lobster rolls looked ok, burger was too expensive.  Overall, i found they did none of the items very well.  I don't think i would go back unless I thought something changed about the quality of lobster and the service.

"I've been to the Applejack Diner about 3 times, all isolated incidents. 
The first two times were okay, probably because I ordered a burger both those times. It seems they are good at those, at least. If you want anything else besides that, go somewhere else.
Last night we did NOT order burgers, and, surprise surprise, the night was one disappointment after another. Flagging down someone for water refills takes tremendous effort, for instance. I ordered the chili con carne, which was fine. Just fine, not remarkable. 
My boyfriend ordered a pasta special, cappellini primavera with chicken. They were nice enough to make it with red sauce at his request. When it arrived, it was missing the chicken. We hesitantly told the waiter and braced for more disappointment, the chicken arrived fast. Too fast. No fresh chicken can be seasoned and cooked through in less than 5 minutes. It was clear that this chicken was pre-cooked and merely tossed in the microwave. 
Perhaps microwaved chicken would be okay if it were exceptional chicken, but my boyfriend said of the food what a few have said on Yelp so far: If he can do it better, then that's a bad sign. Why spend money on food that tastes the same as (or much, much worse) than you what you can make? 

I ordered the Mexican coffee for dessert. It was pretty, in  a pretty glass, topped with lots of whipped cream. The coffee was MUCH too bitter for my taste. When paired with Kahlúa, it tasted lethal. 

We didn't order anything else that night. I would have ordered a fountain soda if it wasn't over TWO dollars, costing ONE dollar per refill! What?! Charge to refill a fancy mocktail or a smoothie. Don't you dare charge to refill soda.
Same with the beer. My boyfriend would have gotten it, but nothing- not even nonalcoholic O'Douls- was below $7. Ugh. Just no.

Finally, I find it a bit more than a coincidence that hours later, I was violently sick. It was clear the food did not sit right. I'm not saying it was expressly the fault of the diner, but I never get stomach bugs and I have eaten things much offensive than chili over rice without anything like that ever happening. Personally, the experience successfully put off the Applejack Diner for good.",1.0
"I had a lunch here and I was hungrier when I finished than I had been before walking in. Slow service, horrifying pad thai. There's no word to describe the oily and disgusting taste of badly-cooked, non-fresh meat in English as far as I know, but there is one in Chinese and it's ?. I'm a meat-lover but after that pad thai, I swear the thought of becoming a vegetarian crossed my mind. My friend who was present for the lunch asked me if I was sick and I had to tell him yes, but the real reason was: I'm sick because the food here made me so.

I've had pad thai in many places (including in Thailand, too!), and this is the first place in my memory that could f*** up a dish so simple as the pad thai. What I wanted to tell the chef but wasn't able to say in front of my friends was: man, you were able to ruin the safest order of Thai food. That's something.

It's now an hour after my lunch and I'm still feeling sick. I feel I can throw up any minute, and I genuinely regret every bit of that pad thai I ate out of politeness. If I weren't with my friends I'd have returned the dish to the chef and refused to pay. This was the most disgusting lunch ever.",1.0
"The decor is nice, but the place seems bland for some reason. 

I had the Lobster Bisque which was pretty good. Then I had the whole grilled branzino and that was good too. The mashed potatoes side was okay; it just tasted a little weird. The tasting of chocolates desert was really good.

With all that said, the one star is for what happened after the dinner. I had a bad case of diarrhea and had to take multiple trips to the bathroom. Will not be returning to this place on account of that.",1.0
"Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time going here.  

Myself and my boyfriend heard about their incredible burgers and were living in the area at the time, so we went.  I will ruin it for you now - the burger was burnt, dry, and came on a burnt English muffin (not advertised in the menu).  My boyfriend liked his burger, but I was not pleased.

When we sat down, I ordered a Jameson and ginger ale.  The server tried to convince me to get Jack Daniel's several times, which was annoying after the first time I said no and asked for Jameson, but she finally caved.  When she came back with our drinks, mine was in a beer glass.  I've never been served any sort of liquor drink in a glass that large.  I wanted one drink to take the edge off.  I didn't want to be carried out of the bar inebriated.  However, the drink was a Jack and Coke.  Definitely not what I ordered.  That really bothered me because the waitress spent so much time going back and forth with me about the Jameson vs. Jack debate.  I told her that wasn't what I ordered and she had the audacity to get mad at me.  She then immediately started shouting at the bartender across the entire restaurant and I felt so humiliated for even saying anything.

She brought back my drink after this incident and it was so strong.  I couldn't drink it.  I asked for a glass of water so I could pour ice and water into it to make it somewhat salvageable - it wasn't.  My boyfriend took a couple chugs of my drink - which even he thought was strong - just so I could make some room to pour water into it.  But after the way our server reacted the first time something was wrong with my drink, I was definitely too afraid to say anything after that.

Also - the food made me immediately sick.  I got home and felt miserable for the rest of the night.  I was upset that my boyfriend even wanted to leave them a tip.  The restaurant looked dirty and was crowded and the tables were all on top of each other.

Don't go here if you know what's good for you.",1.0
"Food poisoning danger.  I used to get take out at this place pretty frequently until we got some sushi that had gone bad.

I was very appalled since I was a regular, not some random one-time customer that liked to complain.  I also didn't ask for my money back, I just wanted to let them know about the issue so they wouldn't serve the food to other people.  I politely stated again that the fish they served yesterday had a very off odor and then they pretended not to know English anymore!  Their Chinese food had always been pretty generic, it was the cheap sushi that made this place worth going to.  But ever since this incident, we haven't been back.  And they have a minimum for credit card purchases even though it's clearly against the Visa and Mastercard rules.",1.0
"I really enjoyed our dinner at the Marshal, that was until I was very sick around 7 hrs later. I had to take a day of work as a result.

It is now several days later and I am still suffering. My husband and I shared every dish except our entrees and I had the short ribs so it must have been that that made me sick. I have a strong stomach and do not get sick easily so something must have been very wrong with this dish.

I contacted the restaurant privately to let them know my experience two days ago and they have not responded to me.

I hope this is a one off incident because otherwise it was a nice little restaurant.",1.0
Made me sick.  I had to hug the toilet for 24 hours.,1.0
very nice place. from the outside and the whole time i was thinking this is pretty. and the bathrooms! i know it sounds weird but if you go you'll understand why! i've been to many high end places and by far the prettiest the toilet seats have so many cool options although I did not use any next time I may disappear for a while!! They were very accommodated we arrived late because of traffic they took us with no problem and rushed out order of the chefs tasting menu because we had a comedy show to go to after. The food was great everything was good not one complaint except the toro made me sick but all toro besides masa has made me sick so no big surprise. Enjoyed everything definitely want to go again,1.0
"I hate giving bad reviews but this place is DISGUSTING. 

First off let me start by saying that s'mac has a B rating and if you're from the city you know that means it is unhygienic. 

Food looks like it tastes good served in cute little deep dish pans, and even by taste it doesn't taste terrible. Take a look into be back kitchen and even at the cashiers they look sweaty and dirty with mass amounts of tattoos all over. It wasn't just the appearance of the staff that turned me off but it was also the DIRTY kitchen. There is no way I can explain how gross it looked because it was just that bad... Just take my word for It. 
There was barely any seating inside, and all the stools were nasty and ripped up. 

I have no idea how anyone can give this place a decent review, seriously.

I came here with a group of friends who came to visit me from out of state and they read about S'mac on buzzfeed and insisted on eating here. I warned them about the B rating but they aren't from New York so they didn't get it and insisted anyway... I wanted to be a good sport so I ate there regardless of how I felt about this place.

My friend ended up getting a bad stomach ache and we ended up being in the hospital waiting for him all night. Luckily it was just one of us who got sick! We all had vegetarian Mac and cheese and my friend who got sick had meat in his so I think it was the meat that was bad and made him sick.

AVOID AVOID AVOID this place... You're in the city there are a million places you can go to get fattening drunk food that won't make you sick. 

If I could give this place negative one zillion stars I would... Run away, Far away from this place.",1.0
"I thought the decor, beverage, and food selection were interesting and different. Unfortunately, my friend ate the food and within five minutes was vomiting all over the place. It was crazy. I think they should have offered him a discount, since he didn't walk out of there with a single shred of food in his belly.",1.0
"Ordered a burger one night to my apt when I was having a craving. First off, it was huge. I'm sure that's a plus for many but for me it was just meat-y meat. If I was going for that I would have gotten a steak. Ate part of it then felt really sick. I don't think it was bad meat, or not cooked right or anything, just didn't sit well with me. Super greasy. 
If I ever want a burger again I'll go to bareburger.",1.0
"While up in New York we were looking for a place to eat and referred to yelp for help. this place gets a decent amount of good reviews so we decided to go out on a limb and try it. 

When we arrived it was 5:00pm and they advised us that they were between the lunch and dinner menu and if we could just wait at the bar until they were ready to seat for dinner. great not a problem sat and enjoyed a beer or two and at 5:30 (when they told us dinner would start being served) walked over to the podium and they said it would still be another 5-10 minutes so we continued to wait at the bar. then we noticed several different couples get seated (people who had JUST walked in). The host never approached us to tell us that dinner was being served so finally at 6:00 we closed our bar tab and insisted on being seated. the wait staff was very attentive however the food was way overpriced i ordered the chicken and it was extremely dry and my boyfriend had the hanger steak that ended up making him sick about an hour after we ate. Complete waste of money there are PLENTY of other places in the city with better food and customer service.",1.0
"Went there last night with my bf, we ordered a pumpkin soup, Basil Moo Shu Roll, Jade Mushrooms and a special bean curd and green vegetables casserole. The soup was basically salted water with pieces of non-tasty pumpkin and non-cooked beans. The Moo Shu Roll was 2 pieces of raw carrots and turnips rolled in rice paper, the mushroom came out like pieces of deeply fried chicken  marinated in a sweet brown sauce and the casserole was mainly massive pieces of bean curd in this same brown sweet sauce. Ebven the brown rice was not tasty, the only good thing was the dressing that came on the poor salad which was few pieces of lettuce...

0 taste, 0 health, we paid 50$ for two + I felt sick after.

I can't believe how it is written ""healthy food"" everywhere (on the website, all over the windows, the menu...). How can such a place get so many good reviews (did you all loose your mind??). This should seriously close down. I am mad that they have such a nice spot on this street. Stop this crap!

One more thing that made me mad : the bathroom was not clean. 

If you really want healthy food, don't go there",1.0
"NEVER AGAIN. I knew better than to go here but I was desperate. desperate I tell you.

Agadashi Tofu was made with firm tofu - horrible. 
Miso soup was dropped onto the table like the waiter was feeding his dog. 
Had a bento box with OK tempura and salad but the sashimi was tasteless tasteless tasteless! and the california rolls were made with obviously OLD imitation crab since it smelled bad and the rice was was crusty and salty. Just sad looking really and I couldn't touch it. I felt sick afterwards.

Rude staff. Stop going here please people. JUST STOP.",1.0
"Came here with a friend, i guess they are going for more of a bar feel. The lay out of the place is just two tables in the front and a counter the runs along the wall. Very uncomfortable to have most of your customers facing a wall even though there is enough space in the restaurant for large tables. The center of the restaurant is actually too empty. Though I love wings, i actually left the restaurant feeling quite sick, too much fried foods, nothing to balance it out. Me and my friend ordered some wings and the thighs, but the thighs were just a chicken strip. And for some reason the batter made it extremely hard. Don't expect actual korean fried chicken. They just serve wings with some Asian themed sauces. Server was nice, but kind of weird to have the server creep up behind us since we are facing a wall.",1.0
"It's hard to review a place when the meal was so not memorable. I've been here a few times... and I barely remember what I ordered. They made Emily sick. You don't know Emily, but she's my friend and in restaurant parlance sick is never a good thing.

Positive... Proximity to Bloomingdales. Don't roll your eyes.. That can be important for a small sub sect of people looking to enjoy a Saturday shopping and eating brunch within a small 2-3 block radius. It's also very nice inside and spacious... so rarely ever had much of a wait.

I've usually been forced to share the meze platter... Because I've always come in with a group of annoying girls that don't want to eat their own entree because they just shopped at Bloomingdales (see above). It's pretty good- the tzatziki is my favorite. Bread is pretty tasty as well and you can keep asking for more. Also tried the lamb burger- decent but a little overcooked. Fries were good (but if they messed those up I would have never returned). 

Summed up by: Meh.",1.0
"Not sure what happened to this place. I was a fan. I ordered food from here and my wife got sick. She had to be rushed to the emergency room.

Its Dirty, Smells, the food is horrible, and I got sick when I got home.

"We live in the area but rarely tried this place.  But since the other place just changed hands again, and based on the good reviews, we ordered take out from Sushi Yoo last night.  What a mistake!  The salmon tasted funny and had a question film over it, the Dragon Roll seemed wet and soggy, and the soy sauce was actually watered down!  I didn't mind my spicy salmon roll or Masago, but my wife got sick from the Dragon Roll, her salmon roll and spicy shrimp.  Not going back.",1.0
"This restaurant needs alot work

I've eaten at this place a few times already, 2 of the 3 times I got sick. We always got half regular half spicy. We got a variety of meat n veggie. Tacky Chinese place. Service isn't the best and its really slow. I suspect they reuse the left over food that other customers don't eat. Never get the wings they greasy and have a freezer taste. Best part of the meal was prolly the shanghai soup dumplings 

If your here for ayce just to stuff yourself for the price $26 and it includes Budweiser then this place is for you",1.0

I'll spare you the details, but it could only have been from something he had eaten at Aji.",1.0
"Cheap prices, fast delivery, but I got sick from the sushi. Tasted good on the way down, not as good on the way back up. Wish I had read the reviews on here that suggest avoiding their fish on the weekends.

"I been here at least 6 times so far. I work evening so i only here for lunch. I think the combination lunch menus are good for the money, but i don't recommend sashimi or sushi. I tried so many high end sushi places in the city. Their sashimi is ok, not great. And last time(at my 5th visit) i got sick from their sashimi. However their spicy tuna roll is excellent, service is great.

I will go back for ""regular lunch menu"", not raw fish menu. Or come back for dinner time.",1.0
"I ordered the lunch special of philadelphia roll and boston roll. It came with soup and salad. Yesterday I ate the sushi and got really sick. Today I ate the soup and salad, thinking it was the fish in the sushi that made me sick yesterday. I got sick again. I won't ever go there again because they are obviously unsanitary. Someone didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom which is a disgusting thought. They used to be great. I would go there and pick up my sushi, then go to the bakery on the corner for a piece of cake. I'm very disappointed and disgusted.",1.0
"If I could I would give it zero stars. The hostess was rude. The food took forever to come. The food was horrible and then I got sick from the food. The place doesn't have a rating,  I bet you it's not good. There are holes in the walls when you walk to the bathroom. They have shared men and women bathroom which is very unsafe. The kitchen is exposed and it looks very dirty. Food at Applebee's is way better than this place.",1.0
"Update to previous comment. My wife got sick, either food was not good or just this is to fat food. Anyway would probably not go there.

"I got sick right after eating their food. They should shut down their delivery service or revamp it. Food took more than an hour to be delivered. When I called the restaurant to ask about the status of my order I was told by the general manager that they were waiting for their delivery boy to come back, that he would himself deliver my order, that it would be fast and it would not be cold, that it was going to be out of the kitchen in a minute. Food got here 10 min later, but cold, mushy, and seafood had bad texture and smell. $33 down in the drain... I only gave 1 star because I cannot give zero star. 
Our experience in the restaurant was completely different: food was fresh, hot, good and service was good. That one was a 5 star.",1.0

"I had the hot and spicy honey chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries here. 
The moment I bit into the sandwich, a lot of the carrot slaw juices started flowing out. Needless to say, the buttermilk fried chicken was extremely soggy due to that as well. 

When you think of the sandwich's name, you think that you will get balanced flavors. Instead you get this intense sweetness from honey, sweetness and sogginess from carrot slaw, a layer of sweet soaked breading on the chicken, and then some very little meat. 

The sweet potato fries lacked any kind of flavor. Lastly, I got sick after eating that food. :(",1.0
"Ick.  Unfortunately, I did not see the bathroom (shared by staff and patrons) before eating.  The sign on the door instructed users to dispose of toilet paper in the trash can, not the toilet.   The trash can was overflowing with used TP, the resulting odor concealed by cloying deodorizer.  After getting sick the next day, I checked the health code rating.  Apparently, the City of New York does not consider sewage backup into the kitchen worthy of many demerits.  The February 2014 inspection noted the problem but the restaurant was rated ""A.""  Double Ick.",1.0
"WARNING: My friend got food poisoned from their lobster.

I wonder if the chef was on his leave because my experience was beyond disappointing. 

We each ordered a $94 four course menu and got one appetizer, one pasta, one main course, and one dessert. 

Appetizer - Foie gras. The portion was almost too large for a first course that it killed the dish's delicacy. The caramelized onions on top was too sweet to swallow. It covered foie gras' freshness and fragrance (or maybe it was just not there without the onions). I'm a foie gras lover but this was too greasy for me to finish the plate. 

Pasta - Trofie Nero. Seriously what's the hype with this pasta? It was too salty and had a texture of uncooked flour dough. I can get squid ink pasta way better in taste and half in price. 

Main course - Steak. The steak was just decent, nothing impressive to please my taste bud. But an average dish was good enough to be the star of the night. 

My friend gave me a bite of her lobster and I sensed a fishy smell. Her stomach felt really weird on her way home, followed by a rough time in the bathroom. BEWARE OF THEIR SEAFOOD.

Dessert - We picked 6 different desserts. They were either too sweet or too bland. The pear gelato was probably the best one because it tasted like pears.

Service - One server mixed our orders so my friend and I had to exchange our pastas by our own hands. 


I understand this is a Michelin one-star restaurant so maybe I was just unlucky. But with a $150 bill I could get some top-notch sushi or buttery steaks.",1.0
"I really wanted to like Barn. They have a great outdoor space, and it wasn't crowded on Friday. However, there were a few things that were very wrong with my food. I ordered a veggie burger, and I bit down on a rock (verified by my date). I should have complained (my fault, and big regret) but I didn't think it did any damage. Later found out it definitely chipped my tooth. It's pretty standard when working with lentils and quinoa to look through to make sure there aren't any pebbles, so the kitchen was definitely cutting corners there. On top of that, I was sick the rest of the night after eating there. 

Please check in with your kitchen - something is not OK. Would not recommend, will not be going back.",1.0
"I wanted to like this place but it was not my cup of tea. Maybe it's just me not them.
Anyways the chicken tasted weird, maybe it's the way they cook it. 
Next the sea-food noodle soup tasted like chicken soup .. And the noodles where super thin for my liking.
The shrimp fried rice smelled burnt but didn't actually taste bad. 
Overall I tried to finish it because my mother invited me but I just got sick to my stomach.
Maybe I'm just not used to this food or did not know what to order, but I wasn't blown away.
The only good thing I found its that its very cheap. It's just not for me.",1.0
"Thought it was odd that either a sauce that had no ""spicy"" stars next to it, sweet and sour of all things, had something hot in it like chile peppers or jalepano or the peppers were in the jasmine rice, which clearly doesn't mention being spicy.  Does everything in this city have to have peppers hidden in it! Also felt sick a few hours later with an upset stomach and thought it was a little too coincidental that two other yelpers within last 6 months got sick. Not a good sign. A little chaotic too at the end of getting my order as some staffers don't know English that well and difficult to follow. The mgr is also a little abrupt when he swoops in to try to quickly solve a ""problem"" with little human relations grace, seemingly more interested in returning to the conveyer belt-like money-making operation.",1.0
"This food made me VERY VERY SICK and gave me a SEVERE STOMACH VIRUS to the point where I had to leave my job early because I vomited from their food.  I've also had to run to the toilet because of their food handling techniques. Eaters beware!!!  Pizza makers were coughing over the food and sneezing. They handle the money with they same hands they make the food with. Their attitude is so unprofessional. Before I knew of their filthy food handling practices I would order from there but I had to stop. If you try  to arrange a pickup your food it will will not be there most of the time.  Additionally they have one delivery boy in particular who lacks professionalism and courtesy. I will never order from them again and if you are looking to support a true Harlem local pizza business that will not make you vomit, I would recommend Oui Oui Pizza.",1.0

It was basically shredded iceberg lettuce with a few Brussel sprouts on a tiny plate. The shrimp wasn't mixed into the salad. It came on the side, which looked unappetizing.

HOWEVER,

Chicken Schnitzel

The food, however, consistently makes me feel sick. The mussels were terrible and half of them arrived unopened. The jerk chicken wings are very good and the fries are very good. The cod fritter was pretty bad. If you come here expecting great food you'll be disappointed, but for a drink and a place to sit outside it is nice enough.",1.0

However, I think that's about to change for me. I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and got minor food poisoning from the Spicy Pork and Kimchi w/ Tofu. The coloring of the sauce was a bit off when they brought it out, and it looked like they had reheated a previously made food. Nonetheless I ate it because I've never gotten sick from anything here. Bad idea cause I had the worse stomachache. 

Honestly, thought the food was fresh all the time, but guess not.",1.0
"The staff is really friendly and the options are incredible, as well as the prices. 
THE PROBLEM is that, perhaps because they are getting more business than they can handle, they have failed to monitor the safety of their food. 

Two weeks ago, I opened my salad and immediately I sensed a funky smell. When I got closer to the dish, I realizes that their chicken salad was spoiled. I threw the salad out, called them so that they would know to throw it out and stop selling it to others, they said sorry and that I could get my money back (I never got my money back as I figured it was a ONE TIME MISTAKE and really liked the place). 

IT HAPPENED AGAIN today, however. I bought a labeled snack from the fridge that said ""Tuna salad snack"". While the crackers, cheese, and cherry tomatoes in the dish were fine, the ""Tuna salad"" was NOT tuna, it was chicken! I figured I didn't want to waste it, so I proceeded with my meal. A few bites into my salad, I realized the chicken didn't even taste like chicken either, it had a sour/bitter cheese taste to it.  Although I couldn't sense the same foul smell from the previous time I got chicken salad, I confirmed that it was bad chicken by the stomach ache that followed my meal. I called them again to let them know and all they said was ""sorry, bring the container back to exchange it."" 

At this point I'm 100% set on never going back to this place. Some people's diets allow them to eat any fish but not any chicken unless its handled a certain way. What if they ate the ""tuna salad"" not knowing it was chicken? What if you had a stuffy nose and couldn't smell your food and ate it trusting it was fine and then got sick? Although I only suffered a stomach ache and a couple of wasted dollars, I'm pretty sure spoiled meat products and mislabeled food are Food Safety Violations. I mean, people can get seriously ill this way! 

They're plain ""I'm sorry"" without an ""I will check it right away and make sure it gets thrown out"" or ""I hope it didn't make you sick"" or any comment showing concern is a RED FLAG for me as a consumer. It's like they think it's okay, or not a big deal... makes you wonder what else they think is okay or what they let fly in their kitchen -pun intended. 

I hope that this post not only makes patrons of this cafe more cautious about eating here but also prompts the owners/staff/cooks/etc to be a lot more careful with what they are serving people to eat. 

These are very unfortunate series of events, but like they say fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... I'm already a fool for going back after the first spoiled chicken, this second time will surely keep me (and all my friends) away from this place FOR SURE.",1.0
"Living around the corner from the Long Island Bagel Cafe started off as a dream. It is near impossible to find egg bagels in Manhattan so I thought my prayers had finally been answered. 

Boy, was I wrong. 

After multiple deliveries, and multiple chances, I have officially started a personal boycott against this Long Island chain. 

Reason 1: The delivery men are horribly inappropriate, having attempted very forward, un-wanted and un-warranted sexual advances on both my sister and myself. After calling the Long Island Bagel Cafe to complain about this incident, and my incorrect order, THEY SENT THE SAME MAN YET AGAIN. I find this not only disrespectful and revolting but also a complete lack of sense. As a woman living alone in NYC, this is outrageous. 

Reason 2: I have to assume that the workers here have the literacy levels of a 1st grader- and that might even be saying a lot. I have never ordered from the Long Island Bagel Cafe and received what I ordered. Most of my orders have been online, how my order can still be incorrect when it is sitting there, printed out is beyond me. And never once, throughout all of my horrid experiences was I ever offered a discount on my terrible meal.

Reason 3: The food, apart from the bagels, is horrendous. I made the mistake of ordering a sandwich, not once, but three times to give the Long Island Bagel Cafe a chance. The croissants where sopping wet and soggy, falling apart as soon it was touched. The meat was old and everything inside the sandwich was wet. It certainly wasn't the honey mustard that I had ordered either. Close to vomiting, I threw away my latest meal, delivered to me at 1:45PM. 

In summary, I would say to stay as far away from the Long Island Bagel Cafe as possible.",1.0

"This place is absurd and that's why I'm writing a review which I never do. Not only do they charge you a new price every time you go in (probably based on how wealthy you look), but today I bought a BLT and the bacon was so far gone and tasted so funny that I was VOMITING PROFUSELY for 3 HOURS straight and had to leave work. I come here for salad and coffee out of convenience and decided to get something else for once even though the food has never looked great, but never again and neither will my co-workers. There is a place a few stores down that is owned by the same person which I usually go to (smaller lines) but now I'm not so sure I want to go there either anymore.

Besides that, things like a basic salad can be almost $10!! This isn't Williamsburg, the salad doesn't have a magical story of how it got there. It's not free-range, organic, sustainable, gluten free or whatever...It's just fucking salad with average ingredients available!",1.0

"Went to Era recently for all you can eat. Enjoyed the hot items on the menu, however the fish didn't taste right, and was later quite sick.

others. I had never eaten polenta before so I thought nothing of it when I saw 
misshaped, missing pieces of the other two. I realized later that the missing 
pieces were spoon marks of eaten pieces from someone else :(. One of the polenta pieces was mostly eaten. I feel really sick that I had eaten someone else's throw away!  How could a restaurant go so low to have served me someone else's left over eaten food.  I was too embarrassed at the time and shocked that I didn't say anything.  Now I am just 
disgusted and very upset!   I have sent an email to them and no response.",1.0

"Initially, I was pretty stoked about this place. It has a really great vibe and the atmosphere seemed lively. Also the prices on the menu were not bad at all. 

However, my experience wasn't the best. Generally, I'm pretty lenient because I come from the hospitality industry. I totally get it. The issues started that people seated way after us were being served and we hadn't even placed our orders yet. Eh...And again I'd be more forgiving if it had been busy. Service was slow and we didn't get our wine until after the sushi was served. 

The sushi itself was pretty good. I ordered a roll of king crab and a monkey roll. Both were excellent. And then, still a little hungry I ordered a california roll. I am sushi fanatic, I am your go-to woman, I will eat! However, upon eating the first couple of pieces of my california roll I noticed it had a watery texture. Needless to say, I didn't finish it and was kind of sad about it. I'm not one to raise a huge fuss. *I was feeling sick about a half hour afterward.*

Overall, this place isn't high on my list sushi places in Park Slope. I might go back to give them another shot, but my expectations are not very high.",1.0
"Ordered through grub Hub ... Said an hour delivery and the food showed up luke warm  less then 20 minutes later , I'm wondering how a meal got prepared fresh and delivered in such fast time. I'm in a hotel no microwave so I had to deal with almost cold food ... It wasn't bad had pretty good flavor ... Until 20 minutes after I ate!!!! I was SOOOOOO SICK sorry to be descriptive but it was comming out both ends I didn't know what to do, at the moment I'm lying in my bathroom floor writing this because I cannot leave for too long without throwing up and I'm contemplating a trip to the hospital !!! THE WORST",1.0
"Came here for a meetup group and felt woefully out of place until I found our meetup friends. I'm not young enough for this place.  My husband said, as we walked through the hall ""I have underwear older than the people in this place.""  

Our son is almost 30 and I think he would have been too old. 

It's loud. Very loud. We weren't able to talk to anyone in our group without leaning in and practically yelling in each others' ears. Food is pricey for what it is, and it's middling at best. Over 10.00 for a pretzel? Really? It's a pretzel. Service was good, the young woman who came around was very attentive to our group. I was happy about that.

Despite the frigid temperatures it was extremely warm inside. We had ordered the meat & cheese plate to share, and I think the pate made me sick. I lost it in the ladies room. The attendant looked both frightened and sympathetic. Believe me, alcohol didn't play a part. I didn't drink, and I'm too old to be pregnant. So, we'll blame the pate.

If you're 25, like to fist-bump and quote lines from How I Met Your Mother, this is your place. If you're 49, slightly tired and want to be able to hear your companions, this isn't the place for you (or me).",1.0
"After being here a couple more times, I decided I hate this place. 

First of all, the people who work there are obnoxious. It's the fakest thing I've ever seen. I can't really put my finger on what type of ""religion"" or ""life philosophy"" they pretend to follow, but it seems really forced and it's weird. They have this arrogance about them and when we went there on a Saturday the bitch said ""the sign outside CLEARLY states we only have the all you can eat buffet on Sunday."" We didn't even ask about it! I think my boyfriend just acted a little surprised about how much the food was, that's it.

That's another thing - this place is way over priced. I know just about everything in New York is over priced, but this is excessive. Nothing here is that good and I'm a vegetarian. I'm not one of those omnivores that thinks all vegan is completely gross. I totally have the capacity to like vegan food, but this food is pretty terrible. One time it even made my boyfriend pretty sick. I just don't understand how this place got good reviews. 

I cannot stress enough that this place is not worth how much you'll end up paying. There are plenty of other places to eat around the area, seriously.",1.0
"I work around the area and was craving Thai so I decided to stop by this place after hearing about it from a coworker. I got the Panang Curry with chicken and it was just awful. The curry was extremely soupy/watery and tasted too milky (it's coconut milk based). I didn't finish my food because I started to feel sick. However, the price is cheap for lunch special ($8-9) and the service was quick. Overall, I won't be returning.",1.0
"Came here with my family on a weeknight so we were seated right away.  It was incredibly dark in the restaurant and I couldn't even read the menu - it was so bad that I had to pull out my phone and use the flashlight to read it.  Then 2 waiters came over and one pushed the candle closer to me, as if that would help, and then made some sarcastic jokes about needing glasses - this sounds like it would be fine, but they were just really strange, and the whole thing rubbed all of us the wrong way.  Then finally, about 15 minutes in, they turned the freaking lights on in the place.  It was around dusk when we walked in, so I guess they just forgot to flip on the lights but decided to be jerks about it instead of realizing what was wrong?
So the waiters were pretty awful, but the food was good.  I followed Yelper advice and got the Funghi pasta which was delicious, and the chicken marsala & pasta fagoli were enjoyed as well.  We shared the eggplant parm appetizer & the shrimp salad which were also great.

However, the other major negative was the drinks.  The cocktail menu was pretty strange to begin with, but we ordered a fruity tequila drink and a cocktail that had a lot of ingredients listed including coconut.  Both drinks were cloyingly sweet and sour to the extent that they were hard to drink, and the coconut drink was super thick and milky like a pina colada.  I thought it would just be coconut rum - I guess it's my fault for not asking, but I didn't expect basically a hypersweet milkshake to be served at an italian restaurant - it couldn't even begin to pair with any of the food.  The drink made my food experience really weird since it just didn't go with anything I was eating, and I felt a little sick after drinking it because it was so rich.  I'll stick to wine next time, but why even put awful drinks like that on the menu!

Also really strange: they were playing old school Nelly and Tupac all night!  We thought it was pretty fun, but it's so anachronistic for a nice Italian restaurant that some diners might be turned off.  Just a heads up, this is not a ""traditional"" italian restaurant in any way besides the food (sorta).",1.0
"Haven't gone to KFC in years. Had my nephew with me this weekend and after an afternoon at Union Sq park, he was begging for KFC. I brought him to this KFC. There were two young women at the register. I was the only one on line so I went right up and they began to take my order. Despite my 9yr old nephew and I being right in front of them, one of the cashiers was complaining to the other about some personal situation, throwing the F word around like it didn't matter. So unprofessional and rude.  Bon Qui Qui status. We got our food quickly and sat down. I didn't even get to finish my meal - the chicken tasted like it was fried in extremely old/dirty oil. While we were eating a homeless man came in wanting to use the restroom, but they locked the door on him so he began arguing with the staff. That lasted for about 15minutes. To top it off, I started to feel sick once we were on our way home. I think it was the food. No bueno.",1.0
"This place is absolutely disgusting..the food is sub-par and the staff is even WORSE!!

I decided to be patient since a lot of people suggested this place. She said we had to wait so we did, two other people came in and she sat them right away, I tried saying something to her and she just walked away..I really don't understand why she was so rude so I approached her and asked why she hadn't sat us and she laughed and finally sat us. We ordered nachos which were watery..why were my nachos watery?!!!.. I didn't want to stay for my entrees at this point and asked if I could just pay the bill, the waitress came up to me and asked if there was a problem, to which I explained that she was unprofessional and the food made me sick.

"Three stars only because I loved it but my mom thinks the food made her sick. 

My mom and I were looking for some great Mexican food after visiting the cloisters. We found this place through yelp and thought we would give it a try. Metered parking, and was not hard to find. 



The service was alright... We had two different girls who I don't think knew the other one was helping us. And getting the check at the end took over 15 minutes. 

We started off with guacamole. It was good, but uou could really taste the lime. The house salsa was GREAT. 

I got the ""tacquitos"" they came with rice and beans. All perfect :) I also it a margarita. I asked for frozen. It was a margarita with a lot of huge ice cube. 

My mom got the chimecangas (sp ?) they also came with rice and beans. She loved them while eating them, but later on she felt sick. Not sure if it was the food or just her but after reading other reviews I believe her.",1.0

"By far the worst of all the Richmond Hill roti shops. 
This roti shop/bar is full of characters. I've seen numerous fights here, police and ambulances while passing through the area. The few times I've actually gone in there-I was harassed by old drunken men, waited on ridiculously long lines and asked out by the guy working the counter only to sit down and eat tasteless food. 
How can West Indian food even be tasteless? 
The ladies behind the counter were all nasty and their food reciprocated. On one occasion, everyone I dined with got sick after eating the greasy, oily food. 
Go elsewhere, there's many more roti shops around that area.",1.0
"Where to start...our party of 5 ordered the chicken and waffles, along with chicken wings and mac and cheese. While the chicken was delicious and very soft the waffle itself was subpar. It had little red velvet flavor and I couldn't dictate what everyone had been hyping up. Along with this our waitress was very lazy and didn't even bring out our food but the porters that did were very nice. Once our bill came we saw a $30 tip added to the bill. Seeing as how on their site it says parties of 6 or more will be charged mandatory 20%  gratuity we were very surprised. After speaking to our waitress she said that she will talk to the manager who couldn't manage to walk over herself and explain to us that they go by the gratuity rules outlined on their menu, even though it was a slow night. Oh and after my meal on my way home I got sick. Soco will not be receiving my business again.",1.0
I've given this location plenty of chances and two weeks ago was the last straw. How does a 10 min wait turn into over 40 min wait and this a carryout order?  The service is terrible and the woman who works there is very unprofessional  workers are young goof off too much and are SLOW in getting orders out.  For their prices that are nothing cheap get authentic Italian pizza. Also got sick from the last order. They seem to be more concerned with filling online and delivery orders quicket,1.0
"Horrible Italian Food.

This place is a disgrace. The waiter who was quite rude. He was from Sicily. We spoke in Italian so I expected the food to be authentic. Unfortunately it was not. It was of such poor quality that I actually got sick from it. The chicken was tough and tasted like it had been left in the freezer for way too long. The eggplant had a disgusting taste and the wine was cheap and bad. Please do not eat here. It is not worth your business.

I really want to like this place because the bagels are pretty good but I got sick of their complete lack of food cross-contamination prevention.

They must use those big Florida avocados for their guacamole instead of the California ones because their flavorless guacamole tastes like an old, melted smoothie that's been sitting there for hours, vaguely flavored with the slightest bit of avocado, and way too much melted ice. And the boiled, flavorless chicken for their chicken fajitas comes out on a plate with a few over-boiled red peppers. SO bad. SO not worth a dime.

It took awhile to get the lemon so I started eating. I liked the way it was cooked but it was a terribly small portion.  I suggest if you go to have the tasting menu.)

Not sure if it was the truffle Mac and cheese or the unforgettably abysmal pizza. Moreover, they increased their prices significantly to the point where the prices don't match the establishment. Here's my point - Who's going  to pay $20+ for really bad flatbread pizza? It's flatbread with canned tomato sauce spread on top. Really bad tomato sauce at that.

I called 311 to report them and now I'm going to the ER because my stomach is killing me!!! I don't know who the manager was but the should be apologetic to someone that got sick over their food. I recommend to stay far away from this place unless you want to end up sick like me.",1.0
Got sick after the Greentea one...,1.0
"If I could give zero stars I would. If you are in the mood for a good burger, do not eat here. Weird thing to write considering they are a burger restaurant. But they suck.
  I want to blame this foul taste on the fact that they are organic. But I can't, I have had great organic burgers. The fault is in the fanciness. The mayo has something else in it, the ketchup is typical of organic ketchup, pretty bland and in dire need of sugar and salt. I ordered relish on my burger. What ever the hell that is on it is nowhere near derived from a pickle. Tastes like curry and cumin, I dunno. Just bad. 
  I should have just gone to Paul's da burger joint, but was too lazy to hit an ATM. I regret that decision. And all for the low sum of 48 dollars. One good thing though, they can make a strawberry shake.

Update:30 minutes after eating in suddenly sick getting sicker. Hate the fact that I paid money to feel like this. Never again.",1.0
"This food was horrible. The lunch special would be a good deal if the food was edible. I came here with a few co-workers, and two of us couldn't eat our food at all it was so greasy and awful and the other one ate everything that was there. So who knows. But honestly, the chicken was gross, and after I ate a very small portion of my meal, I felt sick for the rest of the day.",1.0

Had the double cooked pork. Wasn't spicy and tasted OK.

"This place used to be good but has gone downhill fast. Yesterday I had dinner there - French onion soup and roast chicken. It seemed OK but by midnight I was sick as a dog and spent the whole night on the toilet. Also, ordered a bottle of wine and the staff brought out a different cheaper brand and started to open it before we stopped them and said that's not what we ordered. We were told they ran out of the wine we chose and offered another that was more expensive. When we said ""Forget it"",
lo and behold they found a bottle of what we had originally ordered.  It's too bad this cute little place has let itself become what it is now.",1.0
"Mixed feelings about this place. I would never order sushi/sashimi from this place. I was sick for latter half of day after eating some sushi rolls. However to be fair, I will add that nobody else got sick. So it could've just been one little piece that did me in. I also ordered delivery on a hot day and they put the sashimi in the same bag as the hot foods. Not a good idea. The sashimi did not taste fresh and were not of the best quality. The rolls were very mediocre. However, the price was cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. 

Now onto the hot foods. This was much better. Their lo mein and duck fajitas were good. Beef tenderloin was tender but flavor was lacking so I wouldn't order that again. Price for the Chinese food, however, is equal to or more than any other take out Chinese restaurant.",1.0
"If you want overpriced regular Spanish food then you can come here -_-. I could have gone to a regular Spanish restaurant that charges $8 a plate and received better food . The place is beautiful ,the decor is really nice and the waiters are great but that's where it ends. The mofongo was gooey and tasted like old mangu .The calamari was average . Chain restaurants make better calamari than they do. For the price I paid last night I could have gone to better restaurants and actually had a feast....oh and my boyfriend woke up vomiting at 3 in the morning because of the clams.

"I almost didn't put this review up for fear of humiliation, but I feel I owe it to the greater good.

Here's where we see the limits of Zagat ratings. Placing faith in the 22-point score Zagat awarded Rai Rai Ken, boyfriend and I walked into the store rather confidently expecting a decent, regular-Joe bowl of ramen. Boyfriend ordered the miso ramen, and I asked for the shoyu ramen with corn. Girl tells me there's no extra charge for the corn. We get our bowls and start eating. Ugh. There are some unorthodox ingredients floating in our ramen, and the broth is oily with no depth. My meat is overcooked and tough. As I'm gagging through the food (hey, I was hungry), waitress comes over and tells me it turns out there -is- an extra charge for the corn, and she's adding $1 to the bill. Whatever. 

We leave our bowls half-finished, then figure we'll burn off the bad food by walking home (about 15 blocks away). Halfway through the walk, my stomach starts whimpering, then growling, then churning. I try to ignore it, but finally, I grab boyfriend's sleeve. ""Baby,"" I say, wiping the sweat off my forehead. ""I need a bathroom. NOW."" 

We made about three bathroom stops on that oh-so-painful walk home. Moral of the story? Steer clear of Rai Rai Ken. It's so bad, it'll literally make you sick.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I came today for lunch and had a really bad experience. I personally found the food to be over-rated. My chicken sandwich was very oily and my boyfriend had the texas toast which was soggy. 

We waited over 30 minutes for our appetizer and finally the manager came over to apologize and told us it usually takes about 25 minutes to make that appetizer anyway. I have NEVER been to any restaurant that serves an APPETIZER that takes over 15 minutes to serve and if it for some reason it takes a very long time it is always listed on the menu... the waitress also came over and said it should not have taken over 10 minutes to make so I have no idea why the manager lied. We had to ask for them to bring us over complementary drinks for the poor service. They then brought out the rest of our meal about 2 minutes after the appetizer so we didn't have a chance to enjoy it. I have also been sick all day from the food. Overall I was VERY disappointed with the service and food and I would not come back.",1.0
"This place must use the worst ingredients you can buy. I was so sick after my two egg ramen with pork bits that I threw up on the side of the road BC of the pork slime flavor that wouldn't leave my mouth.

Ugh what's wrong with people who think this stuff is delicious? Insanity.",1.0
"i liked blue 9 burger but then i had diarrhea. i thought maybe it was just a coincidence until i ate from here again a while later...and had diarrhea again. not a good sign so obviously i stopped coming here altogether. i will say that their burgers are decent, and their shakes are actually pretty good.",1.0
"We waited 1 hr and 15 minutes to get a seat for 2. 
If you have a party of 4 or more,  you can wait up to two hours or more.  

I will actually say the food here is good. But it left me with huge food poisoning and many bathroom trips.  It is really heavy of garlic and butter, not to mention it is very very messy to eat. The seats are uncomfortable and no where to hang your coats. 

We had the lobster / crawfish combo. The crawfish barely had any meat in it.  
We also had raw oysters and shrimps.

The flavor is a bit heavy although I didn't mind it.  You shouldn't combine with beer,  because that's a guarantee to a bathroom.  

This isn't a good first date spot and is also not good if you're going out afterwards because you may end up with diarrhea if the seafood didn't sit well.",1.0
"Just had the worst experience here. This review is for this location and not the company as a whole. The staff was rude and extremely slow. My ""smoothie"", which was the kale colada, came in a cup that was not filled to the top not even close. This was probably because the smoothie was missing whatever frozen or cold ingredients it needed to make it above room temperature. I watched the girl realize something was wrong, pour the smoothie back into the blender, walk to the trash can, decide she was too lazy to fix it, and pour it back into the cup. I didn't have time to fix this - I was on the run and they were already moving surprisingly slowly. The result was a disgusting lukewarm blend. I literally got sick to my stomach after drinking it. Needs management help big time. Not cool.",1.0
"Would you like some fish with that tempura?? 

If so, I wouldn't come here. The majority of the menu is deep fried and smothered in sauce. In searching for a new everyday sushi spot we tried Ichiro out and I will absolutely never come back. I want fresh fish and something a little more authentic when I eat sushi, not ground fish battered and fried. We could not even taste some of the rolls because there was so much sauce on everything. This is not what sushi is! Not to mention I was sick the whole night after eating however I don't think it was the freshness I think it was because I dont digest oily foods well and two of the rolls were too much for me

Makes sense that people comment on the sashimi not being great- tempura is their specialty!",1.0

"I never write Yelp reviews but when a restaurant gives you serious food poisoning It's only fair to warn others. 
My girlfriend and I ordered from here last Monday. She awoke in the middle of the night and spent the next several hours with severe vomiting.

I didn't get sick so something in my girlfriend's order of Spicy King Crab Roll or Shrimp Avocado Roll was contaminated. 

We won't order from here again. Food was always mediocre. Service was decently fast but Delivery guys were definitely angry about life. Can't blame them.",1.0
"I was there just last night, I have ordered hot pot. All the ingredients that came seemed alright the crabs and the shrimp was fresh. It is quite unusual for a all you can eat hot pot buffet to have fresh seafood. However one of their ingredient was terrible wrong. The mini sausage link tasted like plastic, i had a bite of it and i felted completely wrong. I tried to tell the waiter that their sausage has something bad in it. I dont know, it was horrible. Since last night i had been having stomach ache. I vomitted multiple times and wasn't able to sleep because of it. I believe that i might have food poisoning after eating that.",1.0
"Ate a Brie, walnut and apple crepe on my lunch break. Tasted seriously wack- cheese was cold and unmelted, crepe itself was starchy and thick- but I was starving so I scarfed it down. An hour later, back at work as a bartender, the food poisoning hit and I had to juggle a full bar as well as running to the bathroom every 10 minutes. Needless to say...An awful scenario. Also, it's worth noting that I didn't eat anything the night before or morning of this that would have triggered the food poisoning (just ate fruit, fresh veggies, and pasta.) do yourself a big ole favor and brave the line at Mamouns, I wish I had...",1.0

"Food wasn't bad. Reasonable prices. Staff was friendly but forgetful. They're young so maybe they're gaining experience. 

Saw on here that someone's guest felt sick after. I felt nauseous the night of eating there too but I just had leftovers so I took a risk to see if it was them. Might just be because all I had that day was cereal and pizza. Maybe it's a sanitary issue or quality of food. I'll update if I feel sick again lol.",1.0
"So I first knew about this place through Yelp's Elite event, and I was so impressed by the wide variety of food and the friendly staff that I decided to return the very next day for $1 happy hour oysters. So I did.

Firstly, Preserve24 is quite the artistic installation. Its concept is evocative of steam punk senses and a shipwreck. There's a giant wrought-iron cage, a piano, lots of steel-grey and wooden elements. So I got a bunch of oysters, and they actually were a bit too briny for my liking, and I ended up feeling a tiny bit sick afterwards. Perhaps too much oyster at one setting? I'm not sure. I would have ordered more food if the prices weren't so prohibitive. Everything seemed a touch too expensive for my tastes - perhaps Preserve24 is fancier than I had imagined it to be. There were also a lot of well-coiffed, well-dressed, well-mannered restaurant staff hovering around - I imagine that - as well as the decor - is what the prices are going towards.

I think Preserve24 would be great for a special occasion, or it might be pretty nice too if I became a regular happy hour go-er and got acquainted with the friendly staff. Otherwise - too pricey for humdrum purposes.",1.0
"Let me start by saying this is the 1st review I've ever wrote about anything. 
Part 1:I am only writing this because I was very disrespected. I am a superintendent for 9 buildings in this area and I get along with everyone. 
I asked to cook for a turkey BLT on a roll and cheese fries with mozzarella cheese. After he said its ready I opened the fries to check he put cheese on them and he did NOT so I said nicely hey you forgot the cheese on the fries and he said rudely ""You said to put it on the sandwich"" I said to him why would I lie to you ?? ... You can say just say sorry and put it on. But the fact he got so nasty and snatched the fries out of my hand and starred at me with a attitude???
Wow!! So I called and asked for the cooks name and the guy at the register hung up on me...

Part:2
I've been coming here only because it's convenient to me but I've been sick with the runs from this place more then once but I don't learn....because there pre-made food sometimes sits 24-48hrs and I've noticed the lunch they put out at 11am still sitting out dried up and gross at 2am next day.

"Why can't I give this zero stars??  I would in a heartbeat. I was feeling cheap and put my trust in yelp as I've done so many times before...I was rewarded with a huge helping of food poisoning. My platanos maduros were hard, mealy and apparently poisonous. I really like Spanish food, maybe I just don't have the palate for Peruvian, but it's unclear why so many people think they are getting such a good deal. The portions are decent, but the quality of the food is exactly what you'd expect for the price tag- so no bargain there. I will say the sangria was authentic, huge and strong. So if you want to get drunk on the cheap or you just like living on the edge, this is the place for you. You may have a throughly mediocre (at absolute best) dinner with a nice buzz, or you may spend the rest of your night with your head in the toilet...... literally. I for one will not be rolling the dice anywhere near one of these restaurants again.",1.0
"The menu and pricing was great: $1 oysters, unlimited mussels with 4 different types of sauces and fries for just $19, gigantic burgers for $12-15, two cocktails for the price of one. However, the quality of the food was not so great. I ended up with food poisoning from the oysters. My significant other mentioned that they smelled fishy to begin with. Food poisoning can be quite detrimental to some people with other health ailments so I hope they follow the guidelines for proper storage and preparation. 

The mussels were okay, i loved how we were able to try out the different sauces with each new pot though. Fries were kind of soggy. Didn't get a chance to try the burgers but my friends enjoyed them. An extra star for good pricing and unlimited mussels, UNLIMITED! Where else can you get that?!",1.0
"Gave me mild food poisoning or severe indigestion which gave me bad headaches and nausea. I ordered a chili con carne here at 7PM on 11/19/13. It took 10 minutes to prepare, so I figured they were preparing it fresh instead of scooping it from a pot sitting there all day. I ordered it to go in between classes and when I got to class, I saw it was black beans not red beans. It was also extremely thick. It was too peppery as well. Seeing as I was just coming from work and would be in class til well after 9PM, I ate it. I ate it slowly too, so it was not shoveled down my throat. No more than an hour later, I began to get severe headaches and nausea. I toughed out class and felt weak and tired. I ended up puking my guts out and feeling cold and clammy. The headaches continued due to severe dehydration. I will never ever go here again. It was a horrible experience. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I have never gotten sick the way I did from eating here. I know it was the chili because that was all I ate all day and that was all that came out  of me when I was puking.",1.0
DO NOT EAT HERE. This place gave me food poisoning. I got a chicken cutlet sandwhich which was the only thing I had eaten all day and two hours later I was sick. Either the chicken wasn't cooked all the way or it was not fresh. Also the guys who work behind the counters freak me out they always have something to say especially to females I noticed.,1.0
"Thanks for the food poisoning. This place has gone down the tube lately. The delivery takes forever and the food has not been good the last few times, I got the sauteed chicken the other day and it got me sick and I am still sick from it as I write this. My guess the sautéed chicken was sitting around from the day before it did not taste fresh at all. that should of been a warning for me not to eat it, never again I will order from Belkys up the block on rockaway blvd where the food is fresh everyday",1.0
"""If you love balls, then eat here"" that's basically their motto but I honestly didn't see what the big deal was. 

Inside Scope: the lighting is dim and pretty old fashion environment. They have several tables and a bar area. 

Food: I was there with a group of 8 so there were definitely different varieties of orders. My boyfriend and I had the classic meatball and my friend across of us had the meatball with the white cream sauce. The meatball was generic tasting & there were a couple of hard bites (some crunch when there shouldn't be one) and when we got back to my hotel, my friend that ordered the meatball with white sauce got really sick and ended up throwing up :( 

Service: the service was okay. The busboy kept coming over asking if we were done eating & we told him no. And when my boyfriend took a breath to chat with his friends, he took my boyfriend's bowl away when he wasn't even done eating (he still had his meatballs). I mean I know we're a big group, but you don't have to rush us out. 

Overall, apparently this is a ""must"" restaurant to eat at but I thought I could have spent my time better at a different restaurant.",1.0
"So terrible I felt obliged to write this review while I was eating here. First off, the utensils were dirty. Disgusting. Thought they used the fork to stab swamp thing. Second, the food was horrible. Example of why you should not try to serve Thai, Japanese, Korean and Chinese in one establisment. The pad thai was bland, the Udon we asked for didn't come soup based and the bento box was filled with garbage. Didn't mind so much of the angry waiter until I got my food.  Just made this lucheon experience worse. Lastly, the pen we received to close out the tab didn't even work.

"Please please please do not trust the reviews of this restaurant, they obviously have people coming on here writing fake reviews (family and friends).  They seem to have a lot of connections and people that hang out at the restaurant/bar, so that must be the reason for all of the good reviews.
We ate here this past weekend and had a terrible experience, it is the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at, hands down.  The food is just terrible, bland and dangerous actually.  We couldn't eat a lot of it, it smelled spoiled, some of it was cold like it had been sitting out, and my husband was sick the next day from eating bad pork sausage.
The decor is dismal and everything just screams cheap - they didn't even have the heat on high enough (December weekend), it was freezing, which to me shows how cheap they are.
Don't go here, you'll regret it.",1.0
"Originally I was going to give it two stars but I felt so sick afterwards that I had to downgrade. You know how everyone loves this place? Yeah well, that's probably more about how drunk they were when they ate the food than the actual food. Maybe Lido is great at Italian fare, but a good brunch spot it is not. Honestly, if you mess up an omelette bad enough that although the customer is mildly buzzed they can still tell thats a sad omelette, then Houston we have a problem. Let me back up, we made a reservation and sat down, got the bottomless mimosas and got going. We noticed the mimosas tasted a bit watery but they were good enough so we weren't too discouraged. Then our food came. I got the pesto omelette with turkey sausages and my boyfriend got the pancakes. In their defense, he said the pancakes were ok. My omelette was another story. You know when you put egg in to oil thats not hot enough so it get kind of dark? Rookie mistake right? So I had a dark oily omelette, I understand they tried to do pesto in the omelette and that could've made it oily but no, just no. Plus some Superrr under seasoned turkey patty things..it was a sad meal. By the time we left we had headaches, I have a high tolerance and was barely tipsy so it didn't even occur to me it was an alcohol headache till my boyfriend mentioned he had a headache too later in the day. How cheap was the stuff they were giving us that it gave us a hangover that lasted longer than the mini mini buzz we got? Only Lido and the gods will ever know, but this place gets a definite pass from me.",1.0

Horrible food lacks in flavor poor service . I ordered grilled chicken with fried rice and I received white rice. The chicken looks like it's melting on the plate. Buong thit nuong tasted horrible also never coming back here again. And the food tastes too salty.

"Greasy Americanized Chinese takeout at a cheap price, and made from even cheaper ingredients. 

This is one of the places I only order from if I'm desperate or am craving that special kind of takeout that, deep down inside, you know is terrible for you and probably full of things you would rather not know about. With this restaurant I have a don't-ask-don't-tell policy. We just go with the flow and try not to think of where this food is coming from or where it has been.

I don't recommend this place, I would actually be embarrassed if I did. But I still find myself ordering from here even when I have a feeling I shouldn't. I haven't gotten sick, although my husband did.

One thing that drives me crazy is that they never follow any specifications. I find myself begging the woman on the phone to cook the broccoli a little extra so it's not rock hard when I eat, but to no avail. And to get rice separate from the chicken wings is just too much for them to handle. 

And although I complain so much, I continue to come back. Something about the food is so bad, but so good at the same time. So, take this review with a grain of salt.",1.0
"This place use to be great but has changed so much.   You use to get tons of food and now the portions are much smaller.  Everyone use to take food home now barely anyone did.   The prices have gone up and portions went down.   They now charge $3 extra for fried rice, it use to be included.   They now charge different prices for different cuts of beef, it use to all be the same price.  Their combs are now $5 more then they were.  I got the steak and chicken.  My chicken portion was so small, it wasn't worth getting it.  My husband hit the steak and lobster.  The lobster tail was a joke, it was tiny.  And this has always been the same but always bothered me that they charge you for you piece of cake to celebrate your birthday.   Other restaurants offer free dinner or money off for your birthday, while this place charges you for a piece of cake and a picture.  Definitely have to find a new place to go.   And to top it all off, I was sick all night from something I ate.  Try another Japanese restaurant because this one is crazy now.",1.0

I highly recommend this place for anything that they do not prepare. Its great for anything that is NOT from the deli section as I got sick not once but twice and let the first time slide but after the second I confronted the asshole sam and he act like I did something wrong, really? I like the day staff they are great people but the overnight staff does not clean the grill at all and takes slow ass time to do ANYTHING. I hate that this deli is the only option around the area but lucky the BrownStone Bar and Restaurant is opening a few doors down so you will not have to worry about food poising.

1- The waiter took our orders and when the food was ready part of our order was missing. We reminded her twice before she brought the missing items without an apology.

An average Chinese food place around my neighborhood. Every time I walk in I am greeted by this lady who works here all the time. The food is good but not the best in terms of quality. They can certainly improve on some things such as the sanitation. The floor in this place is filled with leaves. The tables are dirty sometimes but are clean for the most part. One time the lady was sick and had puffy eyes and was still working and serving food... I got sick the next day .. They also started putting less meat into my food than before.

The food which is generally good was terrible. I ordered fish and chips and the fish was undercooked and the chips were soggy,  When I returned the meal as inedible the manager paid lip service to my complaint.  The cost of the meal was taken from my bill but when I complained that I got sick from it, I was told that food poisining wasn't that quick.  Needless to say I will never go back.

The area in the back is lovely, the service was good (though it was relatively empty), the food and drinks were tasty -- not the best, but just what we were looking for after a long day at the Botanical Garden. Unfortunately, I started to feel pretty ill soon after eating and a couple hours later got violently sick. The four cheese pizza was the only thing I ate all day and it was delicious, but maybe they should check their ingredients. A quick check on their recent health evaluation showed 21 docked points, four of which are ""critical"" meaning that they pertain to the safety of food being served (I.e employee cleanliness, expiration of ingredients, pests, etc.). Hope they turn it around and that no one else got sick today.",1.0
Disgusting !! I actually got sick after and had to call out of work the next day. Garlic Parmesan boneless wings are gross. I would never eat at this place again. I only gave one star because the ranch sauce was good lol if it was up to me this place would have none.,1.0
"first of all lemme start by saying the waitstaff was up to par. very friendly and I think efficient. 

we choose this place because my girlfriend has Celiac disease, which means that she cannot have any form of gluten. she really enjoyed her gluten free breadsticks but the pizza she ordered still made her sick. I got a spaghetti plate and as soon as it came to the table I thought it smelled bad. I ate two bites of the meatballs and noticed that, that was the problem with. I smelled them and they were old. slimy and rancid. I got the attention of the hostess and she got the manager. and I told him what I felt about the plate and asked him to remove it from the table. he took the plate and began to tell me how the meatballs were cooked fresh daily. which is impossible. I've cooked in over 10 restaurants throughout my life and can easily tell when food has gone bad. I'm appalled that the manager or whoever he was had an attitude with me over the plate. so we payed for our drinks and her pizza and we left, and I've been sick all day today (the next day) from two bites of their meatballs. needless to say I will not be going back here.",1.0
You motherfuckers fuck up a wet dream! I came to the store instead of ordering over the phone cause talk ALWAYS FUCK MY ORDER UP! You offer sandwiches with all these crazy names and you don't even know what supposed to come on it! I WAITED TO EAT ALL FUXKING DAY AND GOR HOME AND MY SANDWICH WAS MISSING THE JALENPENOS! I'm pissed! THIS HAPPENS EVERYTIME I ORDER THERE... I also got a fish sandwich and my boyfriend is throwing it up as I type! Sick of yall shit!,1.0
"This place gave me violent food poisoning. After hearing from a couple people who highly recommended this place I decided to go check it out for myself. I got their lamb burger after reading people praise it on yelp and their cucumber salad since I was craving something fresh and spicy. The lamb was really under seasoned, and the ""bun"" was dense and too crispy, making eating it a messy chore. The cucumber salad wasn't too bad I thought, but later in the day I had to leave work early and was home bound all night, having to cancel fancy dinner plans with a date and a fun party I wanted to go to because I was in so much pain. Lunch cost me $9, and it really didn't even have that much flavor. I know I should've tried the noodles, but I would not risk another experience like that again, don't buy into the hype.",1.0
"Got sick after eating this restaurant's food.Their food seems very old. I think they dump all old food in their platter. Same food every day !  Another indian Restaurant at 49-50 st.(Desi Deli) food is better than this because they have revolving customers. 
Punjabi Tadka makes customer fool easily by selling old food everyday.
It's like paying more money just to get sick!

"I was excited to try Spur Tree last night. I was trying to look over the fact that it had a ""B"". We say down at 8:15 and there was two other tables in the restaurant eating. Our food took an hour. Starting at 9, at least 4 people  come by to tell us that our food would be out in a minute. About ten minutes, later we asked where was our food. They repeated the found would be out any minute. We asked what had happened and the waitress walked away. Our food finally came, the chicken curry roti was yummy. The sampler was all fried not prepared on site food. The salmon was tasty until my friend got sick within two hours of eating it.  They comped a dessert, the banana bread pudding. Coming from the south, I love my bread pudding. I took one bite and put my spoon down. It was dense stock banana bread warmed up. 

Would definitely never go back! I'll stick with Ms. Lillie's for my Caribbean food fix.",1.0
"Please do yourselves a favor and READ the reviews here before going there. I certainly will NOT be back there EVER again, after today's last straw. Every low rated comment here is TRUE. Everyone who complained of horrible service, prices and especially the cashiers- is absolutely telling the truth!

This place is an overpriced, inconsistent, unsanitary, noisy DUMP with questionable food quality, constantly varying prices, rigged scales and ILLITERATE, RUDE and most likely ILLEGAL staff working there.

The worst are the nasty, snotty, plain rude cashiers (one fat Latina in specific) who will act nasty and put upon just for having to do their job and serve the customers. God forbid you ask any questions, question a price or ask for any condiments! You will get the nastiest skanky attitude EVER! They obviously don't realize they're not living in some third world country that they ran away from by running illegally across the border any more.  This one Latina in specific will dare to go as far as to talk back in a nasty manner and REFUSE to give you the condiments that you request (in this instance- ONE small packet of soy sauce). Are we rationing food now in the U.S. A. ???? 

If a customer pays $12 dollars, does it really cost you ANYTHING to give away one more packet of salt, catchup, soy sauce...- upon request? Obviously, they think it's a better business practice to lose a customer over 5 cents (for condiments) than to retain one who will pay $12 for the food again and return.  Also, the cashiers (and this one fat Latina in specific) when confronted and asked to call a manager- she will lie and tell you that the manager is not in the store at the moment.  

Please save yourselves from any aggravation and potential food poisoning and go elsewhere. There are MANY better priced options in the area. A soup and a tiny salad bar container were $12 dollars!!! The scales are most likely rigged, and most of your containers will leak on the way out as they are cheap and flimsy.

The way the food is handled and displayed in this place is EXTREMELY UNSANITARY! I have observed this on numerous occasions and they do not seem to improve. Multiple times after I ate here- my stomach was upset. The guys behind the grill and sandwich stations are also very smart-assy and not polite. Often, the portions will be at the minimum acceptable size- for a full price. 

So, I will no longer patronize this dump. Do yourselves a favor and avoid it!",1.0
"Some of worst food we've ever had. We both feel physically sick. The ingredients tasted cheap, old and defrosted. We couldn't finish anything.

The chicken mushroom dumplings turned out to be shrimp and pork and were very hard/chewy. 

The ramen noodles in the eel/vegetable and beef ball/vegetable soups were 10cent lo mein noodles (not ramen), the soup stock was chicken bouillon powder mixed in water. The veggies were all wilted. The eel was off.

The fried calamari was stringy, tasteless rubber rings.

The grass jelly in the iced soy milk tasted exactly like burnt plastic. 

The black milk bubble tea had lots of spongy inedible chunks (of something??) floating in it.

The shaved ice was ok...our stomachs hurt so much we could barely touch it.

I would avoid eating here, it's such a rip off and will make you feel horrible afterwards.",1.0
"I just made an account on yelp to review this restaurant. This is by far the worst restaurant  i have ever been to! By far. We went in to try this new place, we sat down and asked for menus. No menus, means we would most probably get screwed in the price. We ordered anyway, the fish wasn't fresh, smelled bad tasted terrible. Terrible! We were scared we would get sick, so we left the food and asked for the check. We asked to see the owner, extremely rude! They don't take credit card either. We got robbed, a highway robbery. No prices, very expensive, horrible unfresh food that will make you sick, lousy service, and a rude owner! The worst restaurant i have ever been to! And i guarantee the 2 good reviews he has got are  friends or relatives of the ownerl",1.0

Tip - If you live close by, get the sandwiches WITHOUT the egg and make the egg at home.  I feel the meat portions are smaller when you add the egg.",1.0
Wow this place really went down the toilette since it first open.  Do not eat their fish! Unless you want to get sick.  Sushi was old fish was stale and smelly.  Seared tuna appetizer tasted like they cooked it 4 days ago and reheated it.  I'm not a fan in general of Asian food but omg was this beyond disgusting.  NASTY NASTY,1.0
What a disappointing experience. In NY there are so many good places. Why settle for a overpriced mini sandwich. If you want a much better mediocre sub go to subway. At least there the ingredients are fresh and you can get much more for your money. This place is a joke. No not expensive but pure garbage. Every part of experience  was a disaster. Then came the after effects. One hour after eating I was sick as can be. Either the product or the cook was bad. Please include a barf bag and a roll of toilet paper.,1.0
HORRIBLE!!! I feel so sick after eating from this horrible place that did not even get my order half right. Will never go back. Ever.,1.0
"This place has so much potential, but sadly I foresee that it will never be utilized.The food could definitely be much better. First off the food was just BAD. Have standards please. I felt like I was eating tacos from a taco bell in a strip mall in the butt crack of nowhere. The chips we not good. For godsakes, don't purchase the cheapest ones you can find in bulk please. These were flavourless and had a cardboard after taste. The guac was disgusting. Clearly it was prepackaged and tasted off, not to mention I felt sick after eating here. 

The drinks were ok, but I dont think its possible to fuck up a glass of wine and two beers. Oh wait....they did! Our drinks took twenty!!!/or more minutes, and the bar was right behind us. It was busy, but not packed. 

The service was......BAD. Our waitress took forever with our drinks and overcharged us by a round AND autograted our table. Yes, they put 20% gratuity on our bill for our party of three. All this being said, I've worked in a handful of restaurants for many years, and I know how inexpensive it is to do food, drinks, service well. Its sad the owners are being stingy because its making their restaurant suck. Ps:automatic gratuity is illegal in NYC.",1.0
"Disappointingly slow service, inattentive wait staff. Ended up being 20 minutes late to my next meeting after waiting nearly 45 minutes for my food and having dessert wrapped up. It also required asking 4 people to get our bill since it was so difficult to get our actual servers attention.

Food is pricy for small portions and not very tasty vegetarian options (tried the mushroom dish as a main). I actually started feeling sick after eating here. If you're in the mood for a good lunch option on the block go to Ootoya across the street or Incognito.",1.0

Ate a Cemita at one of the trucks and became violently ill on the way back to Manhattan. Truck name begins with a P and it won a Vendy award in 2012. Could not finish the cemita. It was all but inedible and I was sick as a dog about two hours after eating there.,1.0

"As we waited for over a half hour on a Saturday afternoon, the ""bouncer"" went above and beyond to keep us entertained, telling us jokes that ranged from PG to NC-17. Inside, the place is like a seventeen-year old stoner's bedroom/acid trip. Our server was great, and the BYOB policy is never a bad thing. We got a bunch of small plates to share including the Disco Tots, Captain Crunch French Toast Balls, and my personal favorite, the Atomic Fire Balls. So far so good. But when it came time for the entree, I was pretty disappointed. I got the Egg McRuffin, which was described to me an ""Egg McMuffin on crack."" Sadly, this was almost too literal, as I found the meal to be a sloppy and confused conglomerate of cheese, egg, and bacon, sitting on top of a soaked English muffin. The tater tots were very oily and made me feel sick after eating. I'd hate to say it, but for what Queens Comfort makes up for in awesome service and ambiance, they lack in quality food. A little gimmicky, if you ask me.",1.0

"As a vegetarian (transitioning into a vegan), I was really excited to try this place. I ordered the veggie ""pizza"" and the soy nuggets. I was expecting something that had an array of toppings. Instead, I opened the box and saw a lackluster pizza with broccoli bites and a three random pieces of zucchini. The food looked and tasted bland and definitely was overpriced. The nuggets were not bad but I started feeling sick after eating them.



Plus, I waited a long time for the food to arrive. I don't understand how they can spend 30-40 minutes making a two topping pizza on what looked like a flatbread. I wanted to like this place but I don't see anything special about it. There are better vegan options around the city. I won't be back.",1.0

I thought the guy was being nice so said okay and the sandwich was miraculously ready with in seconds.. felt weird but didn't think much of it. When I came back to my office and started opening the sandwich I noticed it was kinda stale and the juice from the meat soaked the bread and then dried up a little.. ate it anyway because I was starving. The sandwich was not tasty at all! And had to pay the price for the next 2 days as I got sick.

Chips and Salsa - the chips were actually really good.  The salsa was so-so.  I was shocked when I asked for more salsa and I was advised that this would cost $3.95.  WHAT THE F?  I've never had to pay for extra salsa ever at a Mexican Restaurant.

Chicken Fajitas - obviously a lunch portion because it was super small.  SUPER GREASY.  Felt sick 10 minutes after eating it.  

I will not go back to this place ever again.  Mainly because they nickel-and-dimed me over the salsa but also because the food made me feel sick.",1.0
"I haven't been to a McDonalds in a few years... A couple of months ago, L wanted to try Apple Pay and I had a coupon, so I was more willing to approve his silly request. We rarely eat fast food, a couple of times a year and only if there's a coupon. 
The wait wasn't too long and they got the order right, they just switched the boxes. $6 a burger is expensive for low-end fast food. For that price I'd rather get a burger from a restaurant, at least that comes with fries. M. T's regular burger is only $19. In comparison, it's almost worth the extra $13.
Anyway, the burgers weren't as bad as we recalled or perhaps the standards at the Jackson heights location are pretty bad. I ate half a burger, I think it was a Bacon Habanero Burger. L also ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese. The cheese was actually not as disgusting as before. I remember once I actually had to remove the cheese and put my own. Regardless even though the food was slightly better, I still would never eat at any fast food chain regularly. (Regularly as in more than 4x a year.) Also L did get sick a few hours later. 
Im not really sure I like this newly remodeled McDonalds. It was much better 30 years ago when they had a playground outside and kids were actually able to run and play.",1.0
"Had dinner here last night. Still feel sick. Awoke at 6 AM with severe nausea, abdominal cramps, followed by diarrhea, still ongoing despite 3 Imodium.
Had rabbit with mustard, cream sauce. Arrived warm, really quickly after ordering. Probably was sitting in kitchen being kept warm. It had a bit of a worn look to it, not freshly prepared. Surface of food and sauce were kind of dull, not glistening. My wife had couscous. It was also not hot and not cooked all the way through.
Cream sauces are a real risk-grow bacteria like wild if not kept hot enough or cool enough. I guess I learned my lesson.

The second time I came back one evening with my boyfriend. I ended up getting terribly sick right after I left the restaurant. I don't know if it was the food, or coincidence, but because of that I wouldn't eat here again.

"I am always down for finding new great Filipino restaurants. This is not one of them.

Inside, the space is simple, but aesthetically pleasing. The seats are spacious and the stand alone chairs have arm rests - which is a relief compared to other restaurants!

I've been here 4 times, now, and every time I've gone, I've gotten more and more disappointed. Let's just cut straight to the chase: the food is expensive here. Most dishes are $10 and up, and I don't know why. The ONLY good thing about this place is the pinak bet. The dish itself is $12, but the portion is HUGE. And that's it.

I've had the ramen here and it was really bad.
Like made me sick bad.
How do you mess up on ramen?!
And what is ramen doing in a Filipino restaurant?

Sure, you could be saying - hey, Cailin, you chose to order ramen at a Filipino restaurant so it's your fault. But could you really fault me for trying to give a fairly new restaurant a chance?

And I had the weekend buffet for $14.95. Head's up, the gratuity will already be included in your bill - which I guess is a little too convenient... The buffet was really mediocre. And I usually love buffets! The fish filet was really off, the spicy shrimp was really really soggy and just shouldn't have been served the way it was, and the experience overall was such a nightmare. The buffet had the smallest stations that I had ever seen. I spent more time waiting for people to finish getting food just so I could get around them than eating, probably. It's so tight, and having to wait for people just to get a plate, or a napkin, or a utensil slowly drove me nuts.

I have really, really, tried to like this place, but the service here is also kind of sad. No one served my table water - I had to go up and find a waiter to ask... Someone at my table ordered a cup of hot water, and the restaurant charged $1.65.

WHAT? WATER IS FREE. Tea, yes, charge me for the tea bag, but you're going to charge me for a cup of boiled water?

"BEWARE AND stay AWAY!!! My experience the first time was good. I ordered the mixed grill. It was delicious, however the second time I went they gave me my usual order (mixed grill) with RAW rice. When I questioned the waiter, he told me the chef was new. A few months (close to a year) later I decided to go back and celebrate my graduation there. I invited my family (15 people) there for dinner. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and AGAIN (3rd time) ordered the mixed grill for a few of us. After waiting for close to 2 hours, It was TERRIBLE. It was missing the most important part of the entree, which was the different types of meat (lamb chops , beef skewers, chicken kofta). We basically got a few pieces of chicken cubes and 1 beef kofta. Everything else that was supposed to be included (that we got during the first visit) was missing. We questioned the waiter and he responded with the same previous  answer ""the chef is new"". Another upsetting thing was their falafels. They looked burnt and smelled like old and reused oil. To make our experience even more traumatic, my mother got sick a few hours after her meal and was rushed to the ER.  Looking back at the bill I was overcharged $57 and I  paid close to $300 dollars for terrible food. I complained to the owner, however he was very cold and dismissive.

"UPDATE: a few hours after this post I got sick from food poisoning. Lenny's was all I ate today. Do not go.

----------------------------------------

As a vegetarian, I'm not a HUGE fan of Lenny's chain in general because I don't have any appreciation for their meats/cold cuts.

HOWEVER, I CAN appreciate the endless fresh toppings that they are willing to put on a bagel with cream cheese. The bagels themselves aren't anything special...they are kind of tasteless actually....but when topped with low-fat cream cheese, capers, tomatoes and cucumbers? It turns into something pretty magical. Plus, at $4.00 for a bagel with all those toppings, I'd say it's reasonable for a bi-weekly morning treat.

I've experienced terrible service from the Lenny's shops around the city, but with this particular shop I'm always greeted with a friendly ""good morning"" and a smile. Not to mention I'm in and out within less than 5 minutes, and the walls seem to sparkle with how clean the place is!

Overall, this is a place for meat eaters...but if you're a hungry vegetarian who needs something to fill them up until lunch (or even dinner!) get a bagel and add as many fresh veggies as you can handle. Also, try their hazelnut iced coffee. It's smooth and rich, and they will give you the option to add soy milk!",1.0

"It's official - the donuts were bad. Mom called me this morning complaining she became viciously sick from the creme brulee and a piece of the coconut cream. Both the dough and cream were sour, where she didn't even finish either and threw out the rest of the box untouched. I'm not sure what was wrong with my entire batch but after spending so much money, I'm incensed at the fact that now someone became ill. 

Warning: these doughnuts MUST be eaten fresh when purchased.",1.0
"I don't think I like Applebees anymore Last night I had a sucky waitress with an attitude because I asked for a new sprite. I hate flat soda and I will never drink flat soda. I asked nicely said please and thank you like I always do. She give me the drink with an attitude and I swear I think she gave me back the same exact drink. So ever since then her attitude began. Tried the new pot stickers they sucked! Filling was weird, sauce was weird. Might not have been properly cooked do to me being sick this morning. I had the fiesta lime chicken with mash and I saw pink inside my chicken so i didn't eat it. I didn't send it back because I was so disappointed I didn't wanna say anything. When my weird mojito came I needed water I told my boyfriend to ask for water because I didn't want any more attitude from her. Suprisinlgy she brung me a glass as well. The dessert was the only good thing. Triple chocolate melt down. It came so fast tho obviously it was microwaved. Even my mojito was nasty like I dont understand. For once I would just like to have a good experience and have a waitress take care of me how I do for my customers. Is that too much to ask??! Please step it up Applebees I used to LOVE your food and drinks.",1.0
"Service was terrible! 

Went in on a Sunday morning and it was dead. I ordered a coffee and a cookie. The barista ran off to the rest room and was never to be seen again. There was only 1 barista on duty so we had to wait. There was another gentleman but he was busy cleaning one of the coffee machines and I am not sure he was a barista. After waiting about 5-7 minutes in a completely empty shop with no line, we decided to give up. My wife told the gentlemen cleaning the machine to cancel our order, he then proceed to run to the restroom and knock on the door to see what was taking the barista so long...as you can imagine, we didn't care to find out and continued to walked out. Not the best way to start your morning. Sure, I understand that people get sick, or emergencies happen, but there really should be a second person ready to step in, or a manager present to ensure operations run smoothly...which in case they did have. 

On a positive note, Chinatown is filled with other bakeries and bubble tea places, we tried Vivi Bubble Tea on 49 Bayard Street and their Caramel Macchiato was great!",1.0
"I got the pumpkin with the seafood and cheese.  Although in theory I should have loved this dish since it combines some of my favorite foods it was extremely stale.  The shrimp tasted bad and the pumpkin which was really squash was dried out as if it had been in the refrigerator for a long time. I was afraid that if I ate more that I would have gotten sick and I didn't feel too well the next morning.  Honestly I would prefer for them to say that they are out of something or to limit their menu rather than for them to serve stale food. 

The service was excellent at first but got really disorganized as time went on. It took me at least half an hour and asking several times to get the check. 

The only upside was the fried egg at the beginning, which I thought was interesting. 

Also the water cup was really dirty and had a bad taste.  Perhaps there are cleanliness and storage issues overall. 

That said most people seemed as though they were enjoying their food, so perhaps I ordered the wrong thing.",1.0
"I went here for the first time with my roommate last night, after hearing amazing things about The Coffee Thing. We each ordered one, and it came from what looked like a milkshake machine. After the bartender poured it into the cup, he opened the lid off of the machine and looked inside and smelled it, which was a little concerning, but I just wrote it off thinking that he was checking how much was left. My roommate and I walked away with our drinks, excited to try it. Upon first sip, it was definitely not what I expected. It was absolutely disgusting. He and I just thought it was the way the liquor reacted with the coffee and whatever else was in it. We drank about half of it before we decided to toss it and grab a beer instead. We kind of compared the taste of The Coffee Thing to sour milk, but didn't think there was any milk in it, and it didn't really smell like it. When we ordered our beer, I asked the bartender if there was milk in the cocktail, and he said there was. I told him I think the milk is spoiled and he said ""Yeah, it was near the end of the batch, I thought something might have been up with it.""

.... So why did you serve it to us, knowing that the milk might have been funky? 

I'm giving this place 2 stars, simply because he knocked one of our beers off the next order to apologize (but just one beer, not both of them), and also because they have a nice backyard, right next to the BQE, which makes it pretty breezy, even on a hot summer night.

Still not what I expected, and definitely not worth waking up the next morning sick from drinking sour milk.

Thanks a bunch, Rocka Rolla!",1.0
"I was the only customer when first getting there this morning. At least 5 staff were wandering around.

Here are details:

Arrived 9.45 and was seated promptly and politely. Asked for water with no ice and black tea with creamer.

As I waited for water, one staffer was talking about f**ing something and that ""white boy""... the guy who made the comment looked pretty white, but I just saw a suburbanite walk through the door and recognised that the comment was probably directed at him. Maybe he was whiter? I don't know. I'm probably missing something.

9.52 water arrives with ice and a hot tea but no creamer. I'm still the only customer.

Waiter takes order.

About 10.05 food arrives (about 20 minutes after being seated), still no creamer. Waiter apologises and disappears again.

The pancakes were great on the edges. In the middle, they were like undercooked grease dough. Thinking it might taste like cookie dough and knowing a real restaurant would never serve anything unsafe to eat, I tried some and it was really not too bad so I took anther bite and that was a mistake! Read on.

10.10 Creamer arrives, but now tea is cold. I've here in the restaurant for about 25 minutes now.

No one will give the check. Went to back. A nice person said they'd try to  send someone out. They now have two more customers, so might  be too busy since there are only 5 staff available to serve the 3 tables (place seats over 300 according to sign near door, so based on that ratio they would need hundreds of staff to serve undercooked food in less than 30 minutes per table, perhaps doable by providing drinks to  customers which they didn't order, like water with ice or tea with lemon and no creamer).

10.20. Never got check. Here for 35+ minutes. Now 2 other tables have customers, so staff seem to have forgotten I am here. Got to go. Running to Target restroom. Very sick. Left some cash on table which should have been plenty to cover the bill.

When leaving Applebee's at 10.20, I ran to the Target restroom next door, exploding at both ends. Not a pleasant experience. Sorry for the graphic description. No more raw pancake batter for me!",1.0
"UPDATE:
I got in connect with the manager who proceeded to tell me that he's sorry that I think I got sick from his food but since no one else got sick that couldn't be true.
He also proceeded to tell me that all of their food is cooked in one spot and shipped to all of the other locations.
That absolutely disgusts me.
The fact that my food isn't even being cooked at the location can add such a health risk.
He also offered me a gift certificate which I will most definitely not use since I got sick from there.",1.0
"A mess! Forgetting about the slow service and mediocre food, I got sick! It doesn't surprise me to see pictures of moldy food being served.

The first time I tried their coffee I got sick because it was so strong.  The whole neighborhood stinks from the smell of the beans roasting.  It smells like burnt toast.

"We came here for RW week lunch:

-They weren't fully prepared when we arrived for our res, since they had ""just opened"", so it took forever to start/be seated/order.  As we had made the res early since we had to leave early, this didn't work very well.  So please offer reservation times when you are ready for service.  And have a better greeting system besides those in food prep all just looking at you saying ""they're just getting ready"" and not calling someone over.

-The service (after that) was very friendly and helpful, though sparse.  (Presumably since they were scrambling to open.)

-The decor/space/food/food presentation was gorgeous.

-We ordered shrimp tempura, fish tacos (both WAY too fried and actually undone, as in still doughy inside, which made me sick later)

-The Catch Roll and cookie/ice cream dessert was some of the best I've had.  So, I would come back for sushi and/or dessert, when I'm not on a schedule.",1.0
"I came here time to time for lunch at the buffer bar, which had been a solid 3.5

However, I recently got a bibimbap which turned out to be a disaster. There were clusters of ""hard"" rice which makes it hard to chew, and a sign that rice is dried out and possibly old. The zucchini and vegs that were sauteed had a slight sour taste, which should have been a red flag for me to stop eating. But I decided to give it a more try because I was hungry. I dont know what they put in the spicy red sauce, but there were visible oil. At the end, I got a major headache, queasy, and had to throw up as soon as I got home. I would advise people to just get the buffet stuff and not get the hot food stuff. 


--UPDATE--

I decided to give it a second chance since it is close to where I work. I got some fruits and hot food from the buffet station and have stomach troubles now. I will not be going back and if this diarrhea stops, I might contact the store.",1.0

"From the get-go, Hayashi was good but unremarkable. In a neighborhood with quite possibly a dozen sushi spots within walking distance, you have to sort of try to stand out. However, I did enjoy the freshness of their fish in comparison to some of the other options (neighboring Mitoushi and Chikurin, being the worst offenders in this department by a long shot). However, it was take it or leave it. For dine-in, it was pretty standard and for take-out they did a good job when it came to picking it up. The last delivery attempt was pretty poor and has officially put Hayashi on my blacklist. And not the blacklist that's 'Oh, give it some time and then I'll try it again'. The 'Nope, you're done' blacklist.

We ordered on Seamless again, since there's really no way to make a mistake on an order on Seamless.  It's physically on a screen or paper right in front of you. You'd have to be lacking a great deal of effort to mess up a simple six item order when its actually WRITTEN IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. They did. That's's fine, I guess mistakes happen (neighboring Masakari does not work with Seamless and takes orders strictly by phone, with no mistake yet after five years of ordering). When I call to let them know that there is an item missing from the order and that we had no soy sauce at all (Yes, they put zero soy sauce and sent the bag out), an inconvenienced voice replied back ""....Can you just take a credit for next time?"". What? Seriously, what? Someone in our party has to miss their meal , as small as it may have been, because you can't rectify your own mistake? Wake up, Hayashi. I let them know immediately that as of right now, there will not be a next time, and that the rest of the order should be delivered. Why is it so hard to do the right thing? It's like whoever was working the phones that day wanted this place to fail . The good news is, they did deliver the rest within 15 minutes.

The bad news? The person that had the item that came late after all the fuss,  was sick the next day. Coincidence ? Maybe. Doesn't matter. 

Peace, Hayashi.",1.0
"This place is atrocious. The food is mediocre and staff is rude. We found a hair in one of our dishes, at first the waiter had the nerve to stand there and say that it belonged to one of us when clearly none of us had the color hair that was in the dish. Eventually he took the dish of the tab. Another person in our party felt sick after eating here.

All the time we were here we felt rushed and hurried to eat and leave because it was a fairly busy day and they wanted tables. Just the worst experiance we ever had in Chinatown. This place is just a tourist trap with food no different then the Chinese at the mall.",1.0
"Sigh. So instead of just heeding the warnings of the rest of the reviews, I just had to see for myself. I came here for dinner with my family. It started out great! Our waitress came and took our orders and it seemed that were good to go. Our chicken appetizer came out hot and steamy and was yummy. There were four people in my party and when the food came out, everyone's food came out except mine. I decided to give it a few minutes thinking that maybe there was a delay or the waitress had to go back and get it but after fifteen minutes, I still hadn't received my food. 

I informed the waitress that my food hadn't come out and she seemed sincerely perplexed as to what happened. She insisted that she put the order in and offered only to remove the food from the bill. She did not offer to have my food made or anything. We asked to speak to the manager and informed him of the situation. He said that the waitress admitted to him that she had in fact made a mistake after she told us that she didn't. He offered me a free meal which I took him up on. I ate that free meal and a few hours late, I started to feel sick. I brought the whole meal back up. I will not go to this location ever again. Please please go somewhere else.",1.0

"I have just reported a food poisoning to the city 311. 

I had a late dinner, the seafood tofu soup, here around 9 p.m. last night. 
From my way home till the next morning, I have had quite nasty stomachache and set of diarrheas. What took me to come here and leave a review is their slick look is deceiving and make people believe the food would be totally okay. 

This is not my first time having trouble and I mark a considerate feedback to the city and next customers. Good luck guys, you'd need it.",1.0
"Words can not describe how terrible and over priced the the food is here! The words ""Do not enter"" are understatement for what should be plastered on their door. 
I have no idea how the reviews have been good thus far because Gari's on 46th Street was literally the worst sushi and biggest rip off my husband and I have ever encountered. 
We are big foodies and often frequent popular and wonderful restaurants in NYC. The sushi restaurant Fifteen East in Union Sq in one of our favorites in the city & is a far better experience than this hole we walked into, but I thought I'd take my husband to a new sushi restaurant that was said to be just as good. Boy was I wrong! 
I can't understand why anyone in their right mind would recommend this garbage hole.

To begin with the decor is cheap and terrible. I felt as though I had walked into a Denney's. 

Secondly, we ordered the tasting menu. Another big mistake since it was the most disgusting tasting menu we have ever experienced. In short this menu is a terrible trap that charges about $11.00 per sushi price and all the chef does is put a slab of thawed out fish on some rice that I could have cooked better and then dabs some creamy sauce on it to give it some flare.


Some of the fish tasted as though it had been frozen for weeks and I actually had to leave a few pieces on my plate because it was so bad. I even bit into a piece that tasted as though the tuna had gone off! 

Then came the worse part of our meal:
The Bill!
$ 245.00 for a date night out full of terrible sushi at a place that looked like Denny's. ( At least if we did go to Denny's we would have left more satisfied than this. ) 
My husband and I were appalled and on top of that, we had to actually take some preventative medicine to ward off any food poisoning we may have gotten from fish that may have gone bad.

In short:
Stay away from this poor excuse for a sushi restaurant. Not only is it awful it's a total scam. Go to Fifteen East instead if you want to eat well & leave happy.",1.0
"I came here a few days ago and had food poisoning. Really bad diarrhea.  It was not good.   I should've known when the sushi came out looking slightly discolored and they tried to cover it with sauce. 
When i ask the girl, she just shrugged and said it is like that.  I only ate the sushi yesterday and stomache started hurting, bad sign.

Another negative aspect we had literally 2 piece of rice left, they made us pay extra money for it cuz we didnt finish.  They just wouldn't take that plate away. The two tables next to us had a plateful of rice leftover and the waitresses just took it away as garbage. Wth? This was throughtout their whole meal. I felt Discriminated as they think i couldnt understand them  ( i only understand canto n mandarian and they spoke fj) we argued but still made us pay. I wouldn't be mad if they literally applied the ""leftover pay"" rule to everyone but u obviously didn't.

"Such a sad review for me to write. Im not a traditional yelper. This is my second time to review. Sigh... well, here goes. I had food poisoning from the beef here.

"After seeing all these great ratings i was expecting a lot better.. Cool atmosphere, but the food wasn't impressing. I ordered a miso soup which was good a shrimp shumai which was also good but then the tuna tartar i would stay away from. Very sweet. My spicy salmon roll was okay.. Not the best.. And i ordered a few pieces of shushi that were also okay.. After dinner i felt very sick.. Not sure if i was too full or what.. Basically if your into quality sushi this isn't the best spot..

I had the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen that everyone's been raving about. While the meat was tender and the bowl looked promising, the soup base was way too oily. I felt really sick afterwards and did not even consume as much of the base as I normally would in other ramen places. For those who like a quality soup base like I do, I would not recommend it.",1.0
"Ko sushi, I hope you know that you just lost a loyal customer in the neighborhood and a new customer. Actually, we told you that and you didn't care anyway. 

This is my second time eating here. The first time was great. Solid, fresh sashimi with great service. It's what I expected on my second visit and why we came back. I left here not only disappointed, but literally sick to my stomach, angry and pissed off.

The sushi tasted TERRIBLE. The salmon sashimi was not fresh and showed up to our table appearing dried out with the edges a bit browned. I ordered a dragon roll and the avocado was also brown. The rice tasted off and oddly soapy. It had a smell that made me start to worry about Bacillus cereus. And why was the rice warm on the rolls?? This sushi was so mind-numbingly terrible, I began to wonder if I had forgotten what good sushi tastes like. Had I wandered so far from good quality sushi that I was doomed to sushi hell? All of the food except for our miso soups looked and tasted completely questionable. As the nausea and abdominal pain set in, I started to wonder if this night would be ending in multiple violent visits to the porcelain throne. 

We complained to our waitress when we finally were able to get her attention. She left to tell the manager and didn't return for 20 minutes despite trying to wave her over and telling the other waitresses and bus boys that we wanted our check. Eventually, she came over and stated, ""Sorry I told my manager and he said the sushi is fine. There's nothing wrong with our sushi."" After some discussion, she finally stated, ""We aren't going to give you free sushi, the manager doesn't care about your complaint. But if you want I will give you free ice cream."" 

We were by no means trying to get free rancid sushi. We had already handed her a credit card to pay. Frustrated, we went up to the counter when another 15 minutes went by as we were waiting for the card to return. Again we complained and the waitress went over to the manager, they laughed and joked. He never came over to the table and simply could not be bothered to speak to customers.  Eventually, the waitress returned with the bill and he took $5 off. FIVE DOLLARS! It was a complete insult. At least we knew the waitress was being honest... THE MANAGEMENT DOESN'T CARE. A 5-dollar discount was a slap in the face. There was no apology or any honest attempt to try to keep a loyal customer. 

There's a sushi joint on every block in this city. And this one isn't worth a dime of your money for its horrendous customer service. Frankly, I am more pissed about how insulting their management was than how repulsive and rank the sushi tasted. Don't come here unless you want crappy, likely unsafe sushi and management who could care less about their customers. Oh and by the way, that $5-discount paid for the Pepto Bismol that we had to buy after we left.",1.0
I don't know how this place got 4 stars me and my boyfriend went there yesterday for dinner had 2 beers 2 sodas and 2entrees bill was $70.80 not so bad if the food wasn't nasty I had a cheese burger that was white inside so I think they refroze the meat and the chef cooked my burger frozen I threw up after I left that's how sick to my stomach I got after only one bite. My boyfriend got the pork chops which is really on one pork chop and it tasted like they got the meat out of a dumpster just the smell alone got us sick. They app the calamari and Mac n cheese bites were okay but that's it the beer on tap was flat from sitting there for so long and I know this cause I use to bartend. They place had maybe 5 people in it and it took the waitress 15 min to get our dirty plates off the table over all this place stunk beautiful looking inside as the decor wise but everything else was horrible it's a shame the owner spent all that money in a place to make it but can't buy better meat or hire a better cook I will deff not be returning here ever !! So I suggest u don't waist your money or time either ! Also no credit cards cash only,1.0
"The service was extremely slow and when we wanted to order shio ramen we were told they ran out... Upon hearing our neighbors order 20 minutes later, the waitress explained to us that they made a new batch. Seriously? Wtf.

The ramen is nothing special. The broth is bland and lacking in flavor and the noodles are too soft. Their menu is also fairly limited. The house dumplings were terrible and quite a waste of money. 3 dumplings for $9.50? What a joke.

The rice rolls (we got an order of the shrimp, one of chicken, and one duck) had way too much noodles as well and the peanut dipping sauce was overly sweet. I ate one and felt sick to my stomach.

"My husband and I have a two-year-old son, so we don't get to go out a lot.  My mother-in-law came to town from Miami for Labor Day weekend, and made sure we got to go out every night - to take advantage of the babysitting.  We decided to spend our last night out at Woodland on Labor Day Monday night.  We live nearby, and the space is so beautiful, we often wish we could have an evening there.  We were so sad when the dinner was just terrible.  The staff were nice enough, though they were often nicely telling us that they were out of the dishes we requested.

When our third choice food came, we were just disgusted.  The grilled romaine salad was raw romaine lettuce with a bit of char.  The overwhelmingly fishy flavor of the salad I can excuse, since the waitress told me it was extremely fishy when I ordered it, but wow - it was way too fishy.  The ""roasted broccoli"" was boiled to limpness, covered in garlic, floating in water - not roasted at all.  The batter on the onion rings fell right off, so it was more of a mix of fried batter and limp onions.  My husband's burger was so under-seasoned he had to salt it at least three times.  Our drinks were watered down and careless. Though nice, the staff were hard to flag down, often chatting with each other in the far back corner.

I am usually the person who calls to compliment a staff person to their supervisor.  Not this time - we spent over $100 (and a precious date night!) on a meal that made me feel sick and upset.  

I e-mailed this review to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago to give them a chance to reply, but they did not, so I am posting it here.",1.0
"I ate at Frankie & Johnnie's this past Friday with my boyfriend because we had heard good things and the Restaurant Week special looked awesome. 
Well, it wasn't. 
I had the crab cake to start which okay but seemed a little undercooked in retrospect. I had the Surf & Turf which consisted of a 6 ounce Filet Mignon and some shrimp; this was probably the highlight of the meal, but definitely nothing special. Then ended with the key lime pie which was pretty gross and tasted like it came out of a box (which it probably did)

I drank one Guinness with the meal, which tasted funny (the body of the beer did not taste like a Guinness) and in hindsight I also should have said something and got a different drink. I went to bed about 3 hours after the meal and I could not go to sleep due to an upset stomach. About an hour later I got up and got violently ill, watching my entire meal come up the way it went down (sorry to be graphic)

Anyways, I felt like sh*t the rest of the weekend and when I called to try and get the matter resolved the manager gave me a run around, basically told me I didn't know what I was talking about and hung up the phone. 

I would never go back to this restaurant and I do not recommend to anyone who is looking to enjoy a nice meal. There are so many better options like The Old Homestead and The Palm that will not make you sick and the food is good quality.

That was the second time I went there and was served filthy glasses.  It's not just one or two dirty glasses....all of them are filthy....my friends and I were so grossed out. I went there Friday and by Sunday I was sick and I'm still sick and I'm blaming those filthy glasses. YUCK!!!!!,1.0
"A friend told me about that place, so I was very excited to taste one of their bagels...but that was a huge mistake! 
I ordered an onion bagel with veggies cream cheese, and it was so delicious and my stomach really appreciated that bagel...for 6 hours only! I got COMPLETELY SICK 6 hours later, and it was such a terrible experience for me since I was going to  pick that place as one of my favorite food spots in this area...so disappointed!!! 

It wasn't a fortunate day... :(",1.0
"I'm super torn about this place, great reviews, great staff, great service, the fish seemed like some of the freshest I've ever had...why the one star? Well I eat sushi/sashimi 3-4 times a week at different places all the time...I could eat fresh raw fish everyday....the thing with ootoya is shortly after having the kaiser don, I got sick...like uncontrollable barf city sick, I'm really disappointed, I don't know if it was a something off with the preparation, or if it was the actual fish, but I got very sick after stopping by for lunch, it was my only meal that day...I came here because of the great reviews and I love Japanese cuisine, not sure if it was just a an off day but I think I'll pass in the future.",1.0
"I came here during Restaurant Week and wasn't very impressed.  I was sold on the fact that presidents ate here.  I ordered the fish (I think it was sea bass?).  It was alright, nothing special.  The dessert was better, which was a lemon sorbet (still not great).  That night, I got sick and missed work the next day.  I wouldn't eat here again.  I think it's overrated; maybe I just had a rare bad experience here.",1.0
I went yesterday with the family for a Sunday funday at TGIF. I ate the burger with the guacomole and chipotle sauce_asked for medium well and recieved well done. The worst part is that I got food poisoned from this burger. Its the 2nd day and still feel ill..this is the last time I go to this TGIF or any TGIF.,1.0
"Avoid this place. I ordered a Tandoori Salmon, and was served with stale fish. I brought it to the server's attention, and his response was that, ""I am wrong, and they gave me good fish"". After eating it I got sick for 2 days in a row.",1.0
"I hate that this place has a four star rating alongside Yakitori Totto. There is SUCH a huge difference between the quality of these establishments! The last time I came to Yakitori Taisho was in the dead of the winter, and it was just awful. It was a Saturday night, freezing, and I thought it'd be smart to come here with my boyfriend around 8 or 9PM for dinner. I was trudging along in my Toms and they told us there was a bit of a wait. We put our name down, but a bit of a wait turned to a 45 minute wait.

They also won't let you stand inside because it's so small and I swear my toes almost fell off. The last time I waited so long to be seated somewhere, at least it was inside and they were super apologetic about it. The staff told us it'd be another ten minutes two times when I asked, and it took way longer than that.

We get seated in the very back of the restaurant. Like, in the back room that you didn't even know existed (I've been here a couple of times and never knew there was a back room). Service was so slow! Probably because they forgot about us back there. We ordered maybe 20 sticks of Yakitori, which totaled to over $60 for the meal pre tax and tip. That was partially my fault, I was famished at this point and got a little aggressive. Boyfriend was definitely not happy about that, we didn't plan on spending $30 per person on dinner. Our terms of agreement for dinner that night were cheap (failed that) and no wait (failed this as much as we could).

For $60, I expect some high quality meat. And it was NOT high quality at all. The bacon asparagus was so greasy it was near inedible. I actually felt sick trying to stomach more than one of them. Nothing tasted fresh. The meat wasn't tender. Everything was way too oily. We left that night extremely disappointed. And I felt like I had to run 100 miles to feel less awful about all the grease that I consumed.",1.0
"I was craving saag paneer and found this place and decided to give it a try. 



After I got my delivery I noticed several things:

1. My food was vegan, but I didn't mind it

2. It came frozen and I had to cook it for 12 minutes in the oven to be able to eat it. 

3. I very much dislike the Indian spice cumin and the ingredients of my food hadn't mentioned cumin, so it was the main reason I ordered this. However, the food was loaded with cumin, which was disappointing. 

4. I've been feeling sick since I ate this food. Been drinking a lot of kefir, even that doesn't help. :(( 



I wish I could support this company, especially because it's a startup. But I had to share this review, as I'm pregnant and may need to go see the doctor if my stomach worsens.",1.0
"Came for restaurant week on our anniversary  for 38$  we always wanted to try it so why not. Salad bar is all you can eat but it was mediocre I only recommend the fresh mozzarella and potato salad. The cheese bread was great and the sides for the table were ok polenta, mash and the sweet plantains. 

Now for the real stuff I'm a big meat eater so the quality really affected my experience. All of the meats came right off the grill which was great but so overly seasoned  and super salty. They were trying to hide the fact that the quality of the meat wasn't great. The  picanha was my favorite for now. The dessert was meh cheesecake and chocolate cake. 

The real issue was when I got home I have never felt sick after eating a meal and oh I felt like crap. I ended up throwing up and drinking a ton of water. I know my sodium intake was wayyyy to high. My bf also woke up in the middle of the night super thirsty. So be prepared to be super thirsty because of all that salt. To say the least our anniversary celebration was limited to just dinner we had to cancel the rest of our night :(

They only got two stars because of the excellent service -__-",1.0
"PLEASE READ if you're considering this place. Now, you might not believe my review since I've been here several times. why do I return? Well, because they are just around the corner and I've been giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I'm done.

Food - I'm sorry to note this here, but there hasn't been a single visit I made and didn't have diarrhea. Seriously, all of my family ends up with the unpleasant problem (including my toddler), and we are Normal. Taste isn't bad, but is far from being perfect.

I truly believe that this place should be closed down, read on for info on

SERVICE:

Breakfast - to be frank, I've only had breakfast here couple if times, and service is much greater than on later in the day. Kitchen I assume is same, as they never care about personalized orders, there attitude seems to be - ""just take it and eat it (and DON'T enjoy it). They even have a busser, but morning servers do great/fair job.

Lunch/Dinner - if you slightly care about yourself, DO NOT GO IN there. This is beyond just service problems. I would close my eyes if it were only that they always forget lemon, or ice don't break ice, don't know the menu, etc. I might not like it, but am not that picky to give 1 star just for that. In addition to having bad service in all sorts way, they just don't care, don't be surprised if you find noodles in your coffee or hair in any dish; but this is my favourite, when we got our deep fried bug with our food and told the server, she replied, and I quote, ""Oh, I'm so sorry, that happens everywhere."" What?! Such a relief.

PLEASE, don't go there, there are many other places nearby, and if you stilld do beware fof consequences that last beyond just the duration of your visit.",1.0
"If I could put minus 5 for this place I would! Disgusting!!! Never in my ten years of living in NYC has this ever happened to me!!!

I ordered delivery a few weeks back from them, and I had ordered delivery a few times before, never anything to write home about, but good for late night diner food. Me and a friend were excited for our food. I ate a bit of my tuna deluxe salad. Until I uncover this little cockroach in my coleslaw. I wasn't even too upset. Honestly I've been in the restaurant business for 16 years. Stuff happens. This has never happened to me before, although I've heard stories. What I was and am particularly upset with, and why I'm posting it is how the owner treated me after I called to tell them. He refused to say it came from them. Because I magically put the cockroach in and buried and it in my soggy coleslaw for a free $10 dish so I could argue with you about it for 20 minutes. He finally agrees rudely to a refund. But says I have to come in to swipe my card for a refund. My companion didn't eat his food either. We also had to order food from somewhere else and wait for it. I myself could not eat because I was sick to my stomach and had been upset. 

I go in and he's gone. And his sweet employee apologizes to me and says he's only authorized to refund me $10, when what we ordered was $28. I brought the food back with me. I decided to come back again an hour later when I knew he'd be there. When I went back in for my refund he again insulted me and said he did not care and did not believe the cockroach was from there and that I must have put it in my food! And that I am a naive little girl who doesn't know what she is doing. I don't care what he thinks this is not how you speak to customers! Especially when you are in the wrong. And I had many of my own thoughts about a man in his 80's who probably has had many interesting bias's from the early part of the century that don't really work with today any longer. This is why I am posting this.

 I honestly would not have put so much time and wasted energy into this if he had not been SOOOOOOOOO rude to me!!! I have never in my life been spoken to this way in a restaurant. This owner is a disgusting human being who needs to learn how to treat customers and other human beings. I will never go back here again. Needless to say I was upset. I called the health department on him the next day and made a complaint. I have a photo of the cockroach that I wish I could add to this review. I have worked in many restaurants over the course of 16 almost 17 years, ten of those years being in NY, and I've managed 3. I have never EVER spoken to or treated a customer the way he treated me! The cockroach was in my soggy coleslaw and I have a photo to prove it. If any one knows how to upload it please let me know. 

Regardless I HIGHLY recommend NEVER EVER going here!!! Neptune diner on Classon Ave is better, cheaper and also open 24 hours. Unless you want a similar experience to me...",1.0
"I tried this place out with my girlfriends for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It's a small place and gets packed really quickly so make reservations in advance. I tried the Station Burger, which was very good. The fries were okay. The ketchup they give isn't regular ketchup. It is some organic type and has a weird flavor to it. I knew while I was eating it that it was going to make me sick, but I ate it anyway. We got bottomless mimosa's, which were okay. The sangria was alright. I personally would come back for the food, but the drinks were not the greatest. Overall, I would give it 4 stars because the service was good and the food itself was good. It's missing that last star because I ended up sick that night from the mixture of everything!",1.0
"When stepping into the elite world of metro NYC area all-you-can eat buffets, one would understandably have lofty expectations of such luxuries as clean tables, edible food, the absence of a feeling of one's insides melting, and chopsticks. Unfortunately, Empire Buffet lacked these and fell short in other ways, too. Here are a few items that caught my attention, but not that of the maitre d/cashier/enforcer:

-If the 400 lb Puerto Rican fellow hockering in the men's room hadn't been as loud as an elephant, I might have been able to more closely study the gang art scrawled all over the fixtures. 
-one should not have to worry about chipping one's tooth on the sushi
-Americans don't like it when you pre-chew our food for us, which is what appears was done with the General Tso's. 
-if you are using lead-based paint as a flavoring agent in the ""scallop bakes"", please notify eaters to avoid them startling other patrons with their squeals of delight/terror. 
-when I ask to have my table wiped of the previous occupants leftovers stuck to it's surface, picking a grain of dried rice with a napkin doesn't suffice. 

My disappointment with the conditions were tempered when I discovered the self-serve hard ice cream cooler, because while all of my expectations had been completely blown, I'm pretty sure you can't get a tapeworm from ice cream, right?  Well, I never found out as the obese teenager in front of me wiped his nose with his scooping hand before dropping the scoop in the vat of ice cream for me to take over. I passed I was off-put not by that, but by the sudden feeling that my lower intestine was rupturing. 

So here I sit in my car outside typing this and sweating profusely for no discernible reason (it's 65 outside). 

One highlight is that I'll likely lose weight as a result of the 72 hours of violent diarrhea that are sure to come.",1.0
"My coworkers and I came here one day for dinner after a particularly stressful week. We first had some cocktails at the bar before having dinner. I am not of a drinker so I ordered a Shirley Temple and the bartender kept teasingly saying ""I should order a grownup drink"". It was entertaining the first time, not so much the fifth time when I already ordered two Shirleys  and wanted a third. 

We were then seated for our reservations. We lucked out and got prime view of the station. I had ordered the chopped salad which was decent. I ordered the Crusted Yellow Fin Tuna (was okay and unfortunately I gotten sick a couple hours later and spent a good portion of time purging my meal from what felt every crevice on me) and my coworker order the steak (I forgot which cut - they liked it). Our waiter was rude and demeaning when we asked about the how well done we wanted our meal. I got the Dark Chocolate Brownie which was the only redeeming factor of this meal.",1.0
"Came here for a birthday dinner a while ago. We had a large group but had made a reservation for around 8pm so we were seated immediately. The place looked really nice when we were walking in and was also nice inside. It seemed like a lounge-ish area since a lot of the seats were sofas. 

What I ate:
- Sake: I can't really remember which sake we got, but it was actually really good. I'm not a sake connoisseur, so I'm not even going to try and describe it. 
- black sea bass carpaccio -  I can see why I don't really see raw sea bass on any other menu...it didn't taste that great and was only decent in comparison to the scallops we had here.
- raw scallops with some sauce: apparently this item isn't on the menu anymore, thank god. the scallops didn't taste very fresh at all and i'm pretty sure I got sick the next day because of this
- miso glazed seabass: this tasted decent, like any miso glazed seabass you'd get in another japanese restaurant. it definitely tasted much fresher than the scallops and much better than the carpaccio. 

Basically, a restaurant that doesn't have fresh raw seafood...probably doesn't use fresh cooked seafood. I'm not sure I'd be willing to come back here again and risk eating something not fresh.",1.0
"I come here two or three times a month, but really I would expect to come more often, since I live next door. There's just something about Breukelen that keeps me away, and I can't quite put my finger on it.  

It might be that it's a bit dark and cavernous, or that I think Stumptown coffee is overrated and damn near undrinkable. Plus, the veggie sandwich (which was NINE dollars wtf) gave me food poisoning once, and when I called to mention this fact, the conversation went thus:

ME: Whoa your veggie sandwich gave me the barfies.
SHE: Yeah, I actually ate one of those yesterday and I didn't feel so great either. But you know, it's all raw ingredients, and some people just don't do well eating raw foods.
ME: No. I eat salads. And apples. And such. And I do not barf.
SHE: Okay, fair point. No refundsies!

Still, despite the food poisoning and my hatred of Stumptown, I do come around from time to time. Basically because I need a place to work, and this is exactly that: a place to work. The wi-fi is reliable, the tables are mostly spacious, and there's a decent number of outlets. So, they've got that going for them.",1.0
"Still searching for a good, local Chinese food place. I tried this place once but my stomach's reaction prevents me from returning. Not sure if it was the oil or just a bad batch of seafood but I got sick immediately after I finished eating. I'd love to give them another chance to be fair here, but I am a bit scared.",1.0
"This place is a dump of a supermarket.

First the people, no one here seems to even remotely care about being half decent at customer service. The workers are often loafing around in the aisles in people's way and chatting it up, one of the guys in the deli area straight up was rude and unhelpful when asked a question (telling me to just look does nothing, the reason I'm asking is because I already looked and couldn't find it), and the cashiers are also rude and uncaring while throwing stuff in the bag can at least sometimes point me to what I'm looking for.

The groceries themselves are overpriced beyond belief and any meal type things premade are old and left out longer than they should be. The sushi (yes I know I made a big mistake) made me sick for days and after seeing the chef crouching on the floor playing on his phone and rarely washing his hands I now understand why.

The only upside is that it's open 24 hrs, and even then unless it's something specific you need there's a 24 hr CVS pharmacy a block over.

Needless to say this place is so bad I would rather pay to take the subway uptown to Trader Joes and endure their long lines than come here. And I live a block away.",1.0
"I was halfway into devouring my ramen meal, when I spotted a big fat ugly DEAD black FLY in my ramen! It was horrifying and literally made me sick to my stomach, making me wonder...what ELSE was in this thing that I hadn't noticed????! I called them and asked for a refund, and the manager, to his credit, did comply and was sorry for what happened.  The refund still hasn't gone through, but I trust it will, since I ordered through Grubhub.
After work, I brought it over for the manager I spoke with to see. At first, he couldn't find it in the dish, and then someone from the kitchen came over to look for it. He announced he couldn't find it either, and even acted smug about it. I had to sift through that disgusting dish myself to find it and show it to them. Ugh! Really awful experience. I will never order from this place again, and I HIGHLY caution anyone who chooses to.   The manager was nice, and sorry for what happened, but c'mon...A DEAD FLY IN MY RAMEN?  I felt grossed out the rest of the night thinking about how nasty that was, finding that thing in there while I was mid meal.  This is seriously making me rethink ordering out.  Better to just make your own food so you know what you're eating.  The kitchen guys seemed to be laughing at me when I came in with the fly-tainted dish. Not cool.",1.0

I was ready to leave and go some place else however he comped me a drink and like I say I was giving it one last try!  Finally got my burrito home after waiting forever to pay, and then there was no guacamole in my burrito! Essentially it was just a huge amount of rice a few black beans and wilted lettuce.  I will not be going back  here due to slow service and due to the fact I didn't get what I paid for, no guacamole!!!??",1.0
"Actually I kind of liked this place. But I ate a dish of fish here, which seemed to be a bit old, and it gave me food poisoning. It was the only meal I ate that day, so I can make no other conclusion. It was very unfortunate.
The restaurant's food seems to be alright but not really good. The lentil patties were very dry, but the fish ones were decent.",1.0
"I was very very disappointed with Umbertos. My girlfriend and I went there one night after work and to be honest, it was the worst meal I've ever paid for. We both got the baked clams for an appetizer, which were greasy, rubbery, and I think they came out of a box. We both ordered a glass of red wine, which was carlo rosi boxed wine. For dinner I got the seafood with linguini. The portion was alright but it was very very very bad, basically inedible. The clams and muscles were chewy and the entire dish had a strong flavor of cardboard. The dish was listed for about $27.00, I would not have paid $5.00. My girlfriend got the scallops and were fried and greasy. Additionally she felt physically ill after consuming them. I usually don't like to pay $30.00 for a stomach ache. 

As far as atmosphere, the inside looked run down and dirty. The decor was cheesy and the walls were all painted different colors. There was a nefarious group of individuals sitting in the corner of the room, the manager was wearing a giant fluffy furish coat and looked quite ridiculous. 

To wrap this up, DO NOT go here. Highly over priced, made my girlfriend sick.... There are plenty of great restaurants to go to in Little Italy, I'd avoid this one at all costs. Literally worst meal I've ever paid for.",1.0
"I love this place a lot, and I wish I could give it more stars, but there has been something wrong with my order every time I've gone. First time was the chicken shitake baozi (delicious and fully-recommended) and the scallion pancake (good, but drowning in oil and made me sick to my stomach later). Second time was the ribbon noodles with stir-fry (delicious noodles, but barely any sauce) and lamb&carrot dumplings (ordered for pickup, got home two minutes later and they were stone cold, bits of uncooked lamb). Tonight was the pork&chive dumplings (delicious and also recommended) and the ding ding noodles with cumin lamb, probably the worst of all. The noodles themselves were hard, like they'd been fried at too high a temperature, and the lamb was chewy and undercooked. I do agree with other reviewers, the portions themselves are generous, and the spice level is excellent, but I wish they'd be more consistent with their cooking.",1.0

"My bf and I spontaneously decided to eat this after a movie date. We ordered a chicken and steak sandwich with egg, ban mi fries and 2 Thai iced teas.

The 2 stars are only for the Thai iced tea cause it was so good and had the perfect amount of sweetness. The fries were good but the girl specifically asked me if I wanted it to be spicy and I said no and when we came home, it was super spicy....

I called ahead of time to pick up. I specifically told the girl on the phone NO cilantro. When we got home, guess what I found in my sandwich?! CILANTRO!!!

The bread was hard, egg wasn't runny like Joju's and the chicken and beef barely had any flavor within itself.

After eating their food, my bf instantly had a stomachache... And is still dying in bed as I'm writing this review..... Hopefully it's not food poisoning.......

We will def not be coming back here !!!",1.0

"Luxor lounge, one of the most cost-effective hookah lounges in the Greenwich Village area. The service here was pretty decent, the decor is a bit shabby and not the best but I would definitely come back just to leisurely chill and smoke some hookah.

THE BAD: My co-worker got pretty sick and threw up multiple times (not because of the shots btw). Luckily, the staff was nice enough to not toss us out despite that. 

THE UGLY: Don't really know if it was the flavors I chose or maybe the hookah needed to be flushed out but no matter what I did, the hookah was very smoky and burnt. It kind of sucked but after a few rounds of shots, you probably wouldn't know the difference.

Overall, a fairly decent place with attentive staff. Can't really ask for much more than that.",1.0
"Came here to try the coffee soju, and my friend and I weren't too impressed. It wasn't anything special. Also, we ordered the chicken and it was very greasy. Made me feel a little sick after.",1.0
"Not sure what all the hype is about. I'm surprised by all the rave reviews. Came early in the day and the artichoke pizza had just come out. The slice is huge. It looked good but once I started eating it, I was disappointed. Too much dough and too greasy. I didn't finish my whole slice and was left feeling regretful, uncomfortably full and sick. My boyfriend and I both said ""I wish I didn't eat that"" on the way out.

Cash only....",1.0
"Not even a one star... only place I've ever encountered issues like this.

So we ordered our food about 2 hours ago. Starting at the one hour mark we began calling them to see where our food was. We were told it was out already. After another 15 minutes we called again and were told that they would need to track down the driver. After another 15 minutes we were told that the quoted us incorrectly and that our food had just left and would be here in 5 minutes. After ANOTHER 15 minutes we tried to called back, and have been doing so for at least 10 minutes, but the phone line is busy or just rings and rings. Now we are in limbo because it's almost 10 o'clock, many of our usual delivery places are closed and we don't even know if these people are going to show up so we can't order anything else. Oh wait!! My husband just got them on the phone, said that the food was still not here, asked for a refund and THEY HUNG UP! Anyways, we will need a refund because, at this point, even if the food arrives, it will be cold and we will be in bed. As I am typing - the food showed up. Still super pissed. If you are good with a two hour delivery time and a bunch of chasing your order then have at it.

UPDATE:  I am pretty sure I am sick today because of this food.",1.0
"This was our fist time eating Lebanese food and it was an interesting experience. The food was pretty good but I don't think it's our cup of tea. We started with falafel which tasted good but was missing something that would make me love it. We both got the chicken shawarma, mine with the  hummus and the salad and hubby's with lentils and hummus. The lemon flavor was a little overpowering for me and I felt like it was all I could taste. The hummus was good, not as thick as the store bought stuff but very flavorful. The waitress didn't bring us any pita bread until we asked for it but it went well with all the food, especially the hummus.  Based on all the amazing reviews I was expecting a flavor bomb, but I  didn't really get that, just a lot of lemon. The service was okay, the waiter and waitress kind of tag teamed us, but they didn't come around often and forgot a few things like water and the bread. It did get pretty busy since it was a beautiful Friday night so I really can't fault them for that. Now the kicker. The next morning I get a severe stomachache and get physically ill. Since I didn't eat any breakfast, I have to conclude that my dinner at Wafa's gave me some food poisoning. That was really disappointing since our meal cost a pretty penny. Based on our experience I just don't think this place is for us.",1.0
Ate here on Friday and had terrible food poisoning a few hours later. Had the rice ball. Probably was sitting out for a long time. Would never go back here again.,1.0
The worst food ever. I even had food poisoning as we speak. Got the spicy wings super under cooked and disgusting as well as the horrible tasting pineapple rice that was cooked with toilet water I'm sure. NEVER AGAIN.,1.0
"OVER RATED!  the look, the smell the vibe.. excellent.. We sat 1 hour late- we made reservation over a month ago, called two weeks ago to make resi 30 min later.. they couldn't and informed us if we didn't show we would be charged 50 bucks a head. so.. after grabbing our first drink at the bar we waited and waited and waited.. then our 2nd drink.. waited and waited and waited.. they bought our drinks at the bar so they did the right thing there, but I noticed this was a standard practice.. everyone was waiting over an hour.. so once we sat-- service was horrible.. we ordered a bottle of wine..we had to serve our self -- do not order the lobster pasta.. lobster something luma- I had food poisoning this am and it def was because of that - veal chop was good. but overall I would never go back until they get there stuff in order.",1.0
One of the worst places to eat in NYC if not the world.   I have tried this place 3 times and all 3 times I have gotten food poisoning.   I can only blame myself.  You can taste it in the sauce that things are not going to go well.  It just tastes oily and not fresh.   Walking by you can see the place is not the cleanest.   I've made too many mistakes trying to give this place a chance because it is in my neighborhood but I am at the point where I am sure I will never eat here again.   Do yourself a favor and stay away. (anyone saying this place is good is lying to you),1.0

1st time there bought a whole chix salad sandwich & large chix tortilla yesterday and ended up having diarrhea whole night and morning =(  The lettuce in the chix salad sandwich ($7.09) didn't look fresh when I opened the wrap. I will not go back there again!!!!,1.0
"Eating at Cafe China is basically equivalent to drinking a bucket of oil. We ordered take-out for team lunch at Cafe China. The food arrived in time (45-60 minutes) and I was really excited to see the whole spread when it was laid out on the table - so much food! Unfortunately, I felt sick shortly after eating because the food was extremely oily!

I had a little bit of everything that we ordered. I wouldn't recommend any of the appetizers. Dan Dan Noodles was extremely bland, and the noodles were very overcooked. The Sweet Potato Pancakes were not what I expected. They should rename them to croquettes because they were essentially sweet potato puree that had been deep fried. Also tasted bland. The Steamed Soup Buns were the worst. These were NOT soup buns because there was no soup in them at all! Why don't they just call them dumplings?!

From the entrees, we ordered the SautÃ©ed Duck with Ginger, Three Pepper Chicken,  Kung Pao Chicken, Japanese Butter Squash with Fresh Ginger & Scallions, and Eggplant in Garlic Sauce. All the dishes were placed on a pool of oil, especially the Eggplant. The duck was savory, but the meat came sliced really thinly so you couldn't really taste much. The three pepper chicken was not spicy as advertised on the menu. Instead, the meat was SUPER dry and I thought I was chewing on a piece of rubber. Kung Pao chicken was nothing too interesting. I liked the squash because it required the least cooking...all they did was dice the squash in the bite-size pieces, toss some oil and sauce, and then sautee them. The eggplant was the WORST. So greasy/oily/etc. Eggplants already soak up tons of oil from cooking, so they really shouldn't have put so much. Now my stomach really hurts :(",1.0

"My wife had food poisoning associated with this restaurant on Sept 15.  She got ill there; they did not take to it so good.  She noticed that someone else had been ill in the toilet, too.  We're suspecting it's the meatballs or the side polenta, as the latency was only an hour. 

On the other hand, the food tasted great; the service was great; the atmosphere was great.  We ate the brioche french toast, duck hash, OJ, bacon, and ricotta meatballs.",1.0
"first time.  super nice wait staff.  just OK cocktails  I would say the appetizers / small plates are better than entree. got the ""seared tuna"" that instead of rare was medium.  not  very good and with an hour of getting back to my hotel I probably sh@! everything I had eaten.  I guess I got a mild case of food poisoning.  might give it another try sometime.",1.0
"I ate there last night around 2. I got the Mexican Frittata and it was meh. It's now 10:15AM and I have puked 11 times. ELEVEN. TIMES.

"heavy broth, which depends on preferences. but no fragrance at all even with the black oil. 
extremely fatty chashu, not in a good way.(when the pork is not handled right it becomes smelly)   I couldn't finish my ramen,  which is not the worst part, it gave me a very bad food poisoning hours later I step out.  

There are so many good ramen places in the city, why settle yourself for this?",1.0
"OK, I love the food at this place. Healthy, good and reasonably fast and priced.

However, I've been there 3 times since its opened and each night afterwards I've had a headache and felt nauseous.  It just can't be coincidence.  I think the chicken's been undercooked.  I have to give anyplace that's given me food poisoning only 1 star.",1.0

"Wish I could give less than a one...

Phoned in a delivery order at 1:45 am. I was placed on hold several times, which wouldn't be so bad if we hadn't eventually received a pizza that had rancid  cheese that you could smell once it made its way to your mouth, which was confirmed when 3 of us chose to take our initial bite into the disgusting slices.

When we called to tell the restaurant, the less than delightful man informed us that without the entire pie we could not receive our money back. We asked him if slices with a bite of them would satisfy this outrageous demand. He laughed, refused to tell us his name for quite some time, then proceeded to become quite unprofessional and scoff at us. He finally said we could bring the ENTIRE (his emphasis, not mine) pizza into the store tomorrow to speak with the manager after 3 pm. (How can you bring an entire pie with missing bites?)

Apparently he thinks this cheese can't be bad because he's worked there for more than 3 years and they ""have used the same cheese since then."" Well, pretty sure the cheese would have expired in those 3 years. But if he is correct, the pizza should still be good when we cart it from downtown BK in 12 hours to their location, by way of the train. Joking.

For food poisoning late night, order from here.

Side note: delivery guy, you rocked! Star belongs to you. Sorry you had to deliver in the weather.",1.0
"Very questionable cleanliness. I'm pretty sure I got a mild bout of food poisoning from eating here.

Right away I noticed that the glasses and silverware was stained and had smears of who knows what.

We were also originally seated at a table that was very warped and sloped heavily enough that we didn't want to sit there because we feared that our food would slide off the table.

The food itself was fine. The steak sammy was bland and not worth $14. The French toast was undercooked in certain spots. The best thing I tasted was probably the guacamole that came with the huevos rancheros.

The service was ok. I felt like we were being rushed out even though there were open tables and no one was waiting. Definitely did not feel welcome.

Overall, not a good experience. I will not be returning.",1.0
I would rate this place 4 stars because their Mango tilapia salsa wrap is good. I order from there the same thing all the time. This time I ordered the same thing but the chicken verison. I ended up with food poisoning about 2 hours later. Not sure if the food or hand washing there is good. I dont think I will ever buy from there again. Lost customer...,1.0
"My sauce was bitter, it tasted spoiled. The cheese was a funny texture. The garlic knots were dry with no garlic taste. I wanted some real Italian pizza.

Well it's official as of 5 pm 7/25/15. This place gave me food poisoning!",1.0
"The food has potential. The eggplant was generous, the fish (little things in mustard oil) tasty. The price is right too. Minuses include the grade pending in the window (these guys have been around long enough to know what it takes to pass an inspection; it really isn't that hard), the expired veggies on display with time cards stating that they're good until 5:45 (about an hour ago- this is not an invitation to get rid of the time cards btw) and the world's worst waitress a girl who has to be told to give me utensils with my to go order and then drops the utensils while handing them over, leaving me to either catch them or ask for new ones.

"The food is still wonderful but the service not quite as good. I order food with no onions but was served a salad that had them on it.

A must go to eatery in New York City. If you are visiting  New York make sure to make a reservation here. It's the top place for getting food poisoning. Your true strength will be tested when you find out how long you can wait in line at a Starbucks in Union Square before you blow.,1.0
"The wasn't as busy as during lunch hours so I gave it a try. 
Price was reasonable considering it is on St Marks.

I was watching the chief put all the stuff. Whole process took less then 5 mins, I was a little sceptical if the food is fully cooked, since everything was frozen besides the pasta and the pasta sauce. So I asked. They told me everything was already precooked, they are just heating it up. 

The taste of the pasta was blend. The chicken was not bad. Biggest issue was the meatball, they aren't cooked at all. Two of the meatballs was still frozen rock solid in the middle. Long story short, I had to call out of work for food poisoning. 

If you want to try this place. MAKE SURE IT IS FULLY COOKED.",1.0
My girlfriend and I walked over from the Museum of Natural History after looking online for a nice seafood restaurant with high hopes.  It was our misfortune to stumble upon a place of business which sells customers improperly prepared seafood.  Two hours after eating what we assumed was a properly prepared salmon tartare my girlfriend started experiencing food poisoning and threw up the dish.  If you insist on eating here make sure you order a cooked meal. The alcohol recommendation did not fit the meal and the bathrooms were unisex.,1.0

"I DO NOT recommend this restaurant for dinner.  On Friday evening April 11th my family and I decided to dine at New York Kimchi based on the 4-star rating in Yelp.  We were ushered through their street level facility to a restaurant in their basement.  My daughter and I ordered Yangnyeom Galbi and my husband ordered Soon Dooboo with beef.  The food quality and taste were well below average while the prices were surprisingly expensive.  The portions were small compared to other restaurants, the beef was chewy, and the majority of the banchan tasted very old.  Given I spent last night and this morning in the bathroom due to food poisoning (vomit and diarrhea), the meal was a complete disaster.  Needless to say, I will not be a repeat customer.  The only positive aspect of the experience was that the wait staff were courteous and attentive.  This morning out of curiosity I read through New York Kimchi's Yelp reviews.  Apparently their lunch specials receive good reviews and are primarily the basis for the restaurant's 4-star rating.  According to their website, the prices for their lunch specials are very reasonable.  Unfortunately their lunch options were not available for dinner.  This establishment might be a worthwhile destination for lunch.  However, regarding dinner, I strongly recommend anyone craving Korean food take a taxi to better restaurant options available along 32nd street.  Depending on the restaurant you choose, the price difference will also likely cover the cab fare.",1.0

"was SOOOO excited to go there about a month ago after not having been in over a year. remembering that whlie noisey, the food was always good and servers friendly and knowledgable. 

it was all fun and games until the food poisoning hit. And I must say - thought it took TWO follow up calls, I did get a returned call from a very nice and concerned General Manager. I'm sure it was an issue of food mishandling/cross-contamination or servers not washing properly (gulp) b/c i'm super picky about my fish and it smelled fine. 

The general manager apologized and refunded my meal. However she didn't address how the server would be paid so I suggested that since it wasn't her fault and she had done her job they take a percent out for her before the refund. They took me up o that super quickly and removed 20%. NOW IF YOU GAVE SOMEONE FOOD POISONING wouldn't you at least OFFER to pay the server out of your pocket or assure the customer that they would not be penalized (which i found out AFTER the fact). 

Thankfully their insurance company did call me back to reimburse me the $75 for my ER visit but NOT for the $40 i had to pay in UBER service to get to the restaurant and back. 

When speaking to the General manager I was telling her how much I adored their almond croissants. All it would take to have a customer for life vs one afraid to go back would have been to send me some, or comp me my next dinner. So I commend them on their follow up, just don't think they did the LITTLE things that can keep a customer for LIFE.",1.0
"Last night was my first time here and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake.. The service was awfully slow (although we did sit in the bar area). I got fried calamari as an appetizer (kind of dull) and I ordered the Siamese Agnolotti which the server recommended and said it was her favorite thing on the menu. To keep it short, the food wasn't appetizing to say the least. Today I spent my morning at the emergency room for food poisoning and have been throwing up all night. This cost me more than just the pricey dinner which I expected so much out of and I couldn't be more disappointed.",1.0
"We tried the Turkey Burger with the Zesty shrimp nachos as appetizer. They were both okay, nothing fantastic to travel far for. The restaurant in situated in a nice area right across from the leather reclining filled movie theatre. However, food didn't settle well and caused us to become a little sick. I wouldn't try again just because of that, so be wary. Otherwise it's decent food for being in the area.",1.0

"I had lunch with my mom there today, after we finished our pedi and medi across street. We never went there before and walked in to try because of the convenience of location. I'm really regretting this bad decision. First we order the Ramen with port belly, the the waitress came back and told us they are out of pork belly, then I ordered the salmon sashimi and Toro sashimi, ramen with seafood and my mom ordered salmon teriyaki. as soon as my mom saw the Toro, she asked me not to eat it because the color didn't look right. My mother is a foodie and has been to Japan, and she told me that the Toro looked funky. I thought she was just being snobbish and didn't listen to her. Another bad decision, because I had bad diarrhea half an hour after lunch. My ramen was not cooked well, and the texture was disgusting and it smelled like chemical. I asked the waitress to take it back and reordered the bed teriyaki. My mom's salmon teriyaki was hard as rock, and stale, tasteless. After our complain, the beef teriyaki was ok, at least eatable. But I had major stomach problem right after lunch, must be the raw fish. Never again will I go to this place. If I could, I would have given it 0 star.",1.0

I had the churrasco meal and felt sick after eating it. Everything else was water on the bland. Apps were small were not worth getting. Also had chicken fried rice meal the chicken had no flavor the rice was ok. Also got Pollo A La Planco which my friend said wasn't good either think ask for sauce on side and put it on top of chicken. I would not go here again. Order 3 Sangrita they were not good at all. I went here for my birthday and left feeling sick and hungry.,1.0
"Came here yesterday because I was in the neighborhood, I knew of this place because they have parties there (dj etc.) since I'm no longer into that thing & wanted to try the food, I figured I would go early. We got there when they first opened 3pm. I was happy to see we were the only customers there. We were seated right away, the place is small, and there is a backyard, we opted to sit inside considering there wasn't much shade outside (plus it was hot). I ordered a white sangria, guacamole & tostones with pernil for appetizers. The sangria came out right away, the guacamole & tostones took about 45 minutes, usually I would complain about this, but the waiter did say they just opened & the kitchen wasn't ready, since I wasn't in a rush we waited. When the food finally came, my husband noticed the guacamole wasn't fresh, and they used a lot of lime to mask it, he also didn't like the tostones with the pernil, my husband said it was reheated pernil, which he hates. I was starving! Right thing I ate all day, it wasn't great tasting, but at that point it was edible! About 20 minutes after that the churassco & rice came out, it was very tasty, or maybe I was so hungry....after that we ordered flan, as I describe to be an effortless dessert, you can basically swallow it, plus I love a good flan, it was ok, pretty basic, the whip cream on top was very sweet. After that we got the check & left. I continued my day as usual, feeling fine, didn't eat anything after that, even though I did pick my my favorite Italian bread & cold cuts for a snack, just in case I got hungry at night. Well that didn't happen, something wasn't right with my stomach, I laid down early with really bad cramps, and sweating. I had to basically run to the bathroom, and was throwing up all night. It had to be the food, it was the only thing I had all day, I woke up this morning, and had to spend more time in the bathroom (still scared to eat). Mind you I did have three glasses of sangria, but that was at 3pm, I was fine especially after eating, I continued my day, never feeling drunk, tipsy, or sick, so it couldn't have been the little alcohol I consumed. My husband said it had to have been the guacamole or pernil. 

Overall this sucks, glad I experienced it, and not when it was packed, but because I was sick all night, I wouldn't go back. 

One more thing, didn't like the bathroom situation, it's two door in the back, then you come out & people are eating right there while you're washing your hands, it was weird that tables were so close to a bathroom.",1.0
"I was excited to see this place in the Chelsea Market. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my husband got the pork belly one. Mine was really salty with too much seasoning. My husband's sandwich was too greasy. He can handle 10 times more of bacon fat and greasy food in general, so when he wanted to switch his sandwich with me, it was REALLY greasy. Oil from pork belly was dripping so bad and ruined my brand new vest as well.... 

The worst part was the amount of MSG in the food. We both grew up eating food with no MSG (i know... it's not typical as Asians), and because of that we can identify the taste of MSG and am slightly allergic to this - i get a headache, feel sick, and feel dehydrated. It turned out to be one of our worst meal during our visit to New York. Their ginger beer was pretty good, though.",1.0
"I ordered two bento boxes, 1 vegetable gyoza (dumpling), and one california roll. Everything was okay besides the vegetable gyoza. The gyoza had meat in there. I am vegetarian and do not eat meat. When I called to tell them there is meat in there they would not believe me. I said I am looking at pink chewy meat because I tried some. Then I asked whats in it and the manager said cabbage and carrots.... There was a lot of other stuff they just didnt know. I said if there was only two things in there I would not be calling. Then I said ask the chef whats in there again. The chef said the gyoza is green which means its only vegetables. They also told me they get the gyoza's from somewhere else. The chef only fry's it. So how would he know whats in there anyway. It can be someone else's error that doesnt care. And they still refused to send me something else saying its impossible that can never happen. I told them dont send me anything, just come take this back so you can see what Im talking about. This place makes me sick literally. I dont eat meat which means it doesnt sit well. They messed up and I feel so bad for the other vegetarians that have to have meat in their food. In reality this can be a legal matter for this place but with this review I will let them correct their mistake!",1.0
"It starts with the reason why you end up here - all the other italian within 3 blocks has an hour plus wait on Saturday night.  So you walk in and sit down. Bad sign. 

Then you r waitress tells you that she's new hasn't had any of the food and doesn't really like pasta.  And you work in an italian restaurant.  Drinks take 25 minutes - to hit the tables - the entire restaurant might have 10 tables in it.  (It is not big or massively busy she is just going to slow she's going backwards)  Calamari app comes out luke warm.  Ravioli entree comes out room temperature - empty drink glasses from rounds long dead left on the table. And then - just went you think you've survived. COFFEE COMES OUT COLD. Not even a tad bit warm.  Ice cold. 

Forget this place - what a total hoax - I had friends in town from SF and I am mortified that we ended up here having such a poor food experience.  And my fiance ended up being sick most of the night from something they served him.",1.0
"Have been going there for years and nothing has changed.  My boyfriend always gets sick after he eats here. He believes the food is loaded with msg, which it might be. However, the skirt steak is good , they bring it out sizzling on the skillet which makes it look appealing. Mojitos are good, a little pricey for fake latin food but the clientele in that area doesn't know difference. All in all would rather hit up a Spanish neighborhood for the real deal.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I were super excited to go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant since we always watch his personal shows on youtube. We went on thanksgiving so the 5 course meal was $115 per person without tax so we were expecting something a little special. But boy were we disappointed. 
The food was unique but it wasn't amazing. It was so creamy that it made our stomachs sick. By the time the entrees came out we did not want to eat anymore. But to our surprise even the entrees were sickening our stomachs. It's really weird how the steak was very well cooked and seasoned but something about it turned our stomachs. We barely ate half of everything. Bottom line, IT IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GO TO A NICE RESTAURANT FOR A DATE, DON'T GO HERE. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED (unless you like super creamy and oily-feeling(?) food)

"Nice ambiance. It's appears to me that the popularity is based on who some of the owners are and the location. The location is beautiful but I must say that I  recommended a party of 24 people for dinner and they assigned one waiter and a few bus boys for assistance. One waitress is not enough to serve that many people . To makes matters worse both times I have gotten sick. I'm not sure if I'm allergic to a certain ingredient or if it's something that is making sick. Otherwise, the drinks are awesome, great ambiance. I think that if they get a solid menu, this place will be a staple amongst people who like to dine. I'm waiting on you blend because I see potential!",1.0
I went to the Red Rooster last weekend with two girlfriends from out of town who wanted to go.  I am from New York and never been as I have had friends who have gone in the past when they were first open and had very bad experiences.  It was by far the worse dining experience I have had.  The service was attentive but the food was mediocre at best with instances of very bad.  One of my friends was extremely sick when she returned to her hotel.  She had the yard chicken dish which did not seem to be properly cooked.  I have read the other reviews regarding the food of this place and wonder if we were in the same place! Well if this is Marcus Samuelson's restaurant in Harlem NY then we were and I must say for a recognized award winning chef this food is absolutely not worth the trip or the cost.  I wish I could give a negative star.,1.0
"Leron's Lesson: Food made me sick. Tiny restaurant. Mediocre service. 

Full Review: Stopped here on a Friday night for dinner. Ordered fried calamari and two noodle dishes. Shortly after, started to feel sick. Service was lacking and seemed disinterested. Also if you want to substitute noodle types there is an additional charge. Unfortunately I would not recommend this place.",1.0

"Ew!  Apps and fresh juices were very good.  We went on Feb. 8th, it was a Sunday around dinner time.  I can guarantee you,  the pasta in the display case along the aisle you walk out to the market,  it looked dried up and not so very fresh.  I ordered the pasta with the short rib meat.   Within an hour,  I became VERY ill.  We had six of us at dinner,  I was the only one who became so sick.  No one ate the same dish.  Not sure,  the meat could have been bad.  I will NEVER eat there again.  Service was decent.  I hope they truly are making their food fresh daily.",1.0

"Wish I could give a ZERO rating but Yelp doesn't let you. Just got home with a take-out order. Took a bite of the Spicy tuna roll and had to spit it out. PURE NASTY BAD FISH. The roll was so bad that I had to throw the entire roll in the garbage. Will never eat at Taro again. Have been going to this place for years. Have been eating here since they had the smaller location on Dean Street. This eating experience was bad. Shocking they would serve nasty foul bad fish. They should be ashamed of the nastiness served here. SHOCKED AT HOW BAD THE FISH TASTED,  OLD NASTY ROTTEN SMELLY FISH. A true waste of money considering there are so many other choices in the hood. Taro you should not get people SICK WITH YOUR NASTY OLD ROTTEN FISH ! BOYCOTT THIS NASTY FISH HOLE.",1.0
"If you care about food, please DO NOT GO HERE! Place had a B rating, which was a clue we should have turned and ran to another place. The worst Chinese food my family and I have ever had. Almost everything was inedible. Ribs scrawny and burnt, Cold Sesame noodles too salty and no peanut flavor at all. Veggies rolls ordinary. We were the only ones in the restaurant and the service was still terrible! Had to flag down our guy 2 times for more duck sauce and tea. The chicken in the chicken&broccoli was rubbery and nasty. Moo Shoo Pork almost made me sick. Really. Had to find a can of Ginger Ale on 2nd Ave. or I was in trouble. Listen, with so many Chinese choices in the City, please please please don't go here. You'll thank me!",1.0
"MADE ME VIOLENTLY ILL. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE. Had cheese sticks and french fries. This means the bacteria was cross contamination - dirty hands, dirty people, dirty facility.

"I've had takeout from here on a number of occasions, thinking each bad experience I had was just an off-night, but now it's been far too many to give them another chance. Honestly, it's just a bad restaurant. Most importantly, the sushi is horrible, and on the last occasion the seaweed salad got me sick. 

It doesn't help that every time I walk in it's almost as if it's an annoyance that I'm there to take out. A manager (or some employee) always has paperwork spread out in the middle out the bar.

Take the time to walk the extra block for a different place if you're craving sushi. This doesn't even cut it to satisfy a craving - it's not good.",1.0
"I had about a year/a half without eating at this establishment & I remembered why. I don't even know where I should start: from the amount of hookah smoke everywhere while your eating (don't get me wrong I smoke hookah here & there but, I don't enjoy it while I am eating), slow service, 22% added to the check for a party of 3 or overly salted salmon.  Honesty, I had dinner here because my Father who doesn't live in NYC wanted to eat at a local place where he thought the food would be good..... I love supporting establishments Uptown however, it really grinds my gears when you don't get what you pay for..... Forgot to the add that the music was blasting & I literally had to YELL to my party... Lastly, I became real sick when I arrived home :/ Papasitos no MAS para comer",1.0
"My how the mighty have fallen. I used to really love this place, but on my last visit nearly every aspect of the restaurant had taken a turn for the worse. First this location completely ransacked the menu, stripping it down to just a few items and almost no sides. Several of the sides (like the potatoes) were one of the main draws for me. Second, the service was amateur at best. Third, and most importantly, the food made me sick as a dog - I don't know if I will ever be back.",1.0

"This place is now called Asian Fresh.
If I have to say this restaurant with two words, it would be ""BEWARE, AVOID""!!!!
AVOID it at all cost!!! 
It was a major disappointment.
My ""get to go spot"" (Thai Forest) is not close to my job for delivery and I was craving for Pad Thai.
A few friends knew this place as Thai Fresh, they loved this place and I never tried it until recently. 
I ordered for delivery, Thai Iced Tea, Thai Fresh roll, Scallion Pancakes and Chicken Pad Thai, as the usual from my get to go spot. It was under $20. I only enjoyed the scallion pancakes and Thai Fresh roll, I was really disappointed. I did not expected to have the apps to taste better than the main course. Thai Iced Tea was tasteless (tasted like plain water with orange dye) and it was from the instant powery mix. Chicken Pad Thai, it was horrible. Tasteless, mushy noodles, and there was no seasoning on the meat and the vegtables. I could not finish my Pad Thai. I went home that night, sick!
I would order again just for the apps, not the drinks or main courses ever again.

Or get disappointed by your first love, food. 
Food should never disappoint you, especially if you are a foodie.

There's an elderly man working the registers at night now who based on my interactions with him, appears to hate women.

It used to be a cute ridiculously expensive store conveniently open 24 hours but now there's a very shady feel to it.  From now on, I'll be shopping elsewhere.  There's a 7-Eleven on 1st Ave for middle of the night shopping needs.",1.0

"Lacks consistency. I used to really love this place, but this last order made me sick, literally. Ordered the lamb, which was sparse and they forgot to give the mashed potatoes, not worth the high price.

I've had good results here before but some nights it's just terrible, and I think tonight was my last. They used to be great, but they've really gone downhill.",1.0

(As they couldn't seat 2 people at a four top)

My wife got very sick while eating the food here and had to be escorted out by a different manager (who was very helpful) as she felt like she had been drugged. We have a suspicion that something was done to her food, as the rude lady that sat us grinned and waved at us as she was leaving work for the day.

"So I know this place is brand new and I need to give it the benefit of the doubt.. But I really wasn't thrilled with my lunch. Going with 3 star. Really 2, but since they are new...

Tons of options.. They were wandering around giving out pasta samples. (No trash cans anywhere to throw sample away though. And none by soups to try. And no labels on soup either.)

I wandered around for awhile and stared at every board before deciding on a vegetable burrito. So all the burritos are 7.95. Build your own or pre defined. Says on the sign of BYOB.. tortilla or bowl. And yellow or brown rice. None of the burritos listed rice... So I assumed all the burritos had rice. Plus to me.. Burrito equals beans and rice. 

There were two vegetarian options - Vegetable which listed mozzarella, mushroom, spinach, guacamole, pico de gallo and corn. And a Mediterranean, that listed zucchini, feta and some other items. 

The guy was trying to read the list of how to prepare my 'burrito', he took out a spinach wrap, put some romaine down, about 4 or 5 slices of deli mozzarella on it, a bucket load of guacamole, asked if I Wanted zucchini which I said was fine... and them layered on pico de gallo and apparently green salsa as well. Didn't see him add green salsa, but it was dripping out when I ate it. So it got added to). I went to ask for rice.. but he already folded it and threw it on the panini press. Okay fine.. looks like I am having a veggie wrap instead of a burrito. 

I also got a couple of items off of steam tables.. that was okay. One plus of this over Essen, is they have plain steamed veggies in the wells. 

But this 'burrito,' I get back to office, open it.. its cold.. because there was no hot ingredients in it... so fatty!! I ate half and instantly got sick.. All the cheese and guac. And salt from double salsas. The guac was good, but way too much. Squash was good. Pico de gallo was good. But months worth of cheese. No spinach. No mushrooms. No corn.. And no beans and rice. This was not a veggie burrito. This is a cheese wrap with a cup of guac. thrown in it. 

I think they need to step up this station.. To really serve burritos. And to be able to prepare what is on the menu.",1.0

"I found this place because to all the yelp reviews.  We liked it so much the first time we visited that we decided to come back another day.  The 2nd time we came back I got sick, and since what I ate here was the only thing I had that day,  I can safely narrow it down to this restaurant.

First off, we ordered a variety of dishes that included:  stir fried sliced pork belly, crispy chicken with spicy garlic sauce, a noodle dish with meat (sorry but I forgot which specific one), crispy orange chicken, and peppered steak.  Everything was very good!!  The sliced pork belly was a little greasy, but that is kinda expected with pork.

I would have rated the place at 4 to 4.5 stars on my first visit.  Probably the best and most authentic Chinese food I have ever had, and I go to china town in SF once or twice a year.

The 2nd time we came, we ordered almost everything the same except for the pork belly, of which I ordered it cooked a different way.  I got the double cooked sliced pork belly this time around.  I did not have anything to eat till we came here for lunch, so an hour and a half later.... when things got unpleasant,  it was an easy guess where I got sick from.  It may be the oil they used or something like that because, um, lets just say things looked oily when my stomach got upset.  I had to dock a star for this.

Honestly,  I probably would still come back if I were in NYC again.  Its still a solid place and the food was pretty good.  Hopefully that upset stomach was an isolated experience.",1.0
"Unfortunately I cannot give negative stars.  Your contaminated Thai iced tea made my daughter projectile vomit up the entire meal in the middle of the night after severe stomach pains.

Clean up your restaurant before you kill someone.  Just disgusting.",1.0
"Ordered delivery from 4 blocks away.  One hour and 15 minutes and three phone calls later our order arrived.

(I always give people a second chance) my concern is how they f***ed up both times. They say time cures all, but for ""The Square"" eternity wouldn't help them!!!!!!
Well new developments ; about 6 hours later developed stomach pain accompanied with diarrhea ( Last thing I ate was garbage pizza) . It is now 21 hours after eating this shit and still sick .

"I was excited to eat here after having had it a few years ago at the Greenwich location. I was going to order my usual egg noodles with chicken and the saigon sauce, but decided to try something totally out of character: first mistake. I got the tofu with bangkok sauce (curry coconut). I wont say it tasted off but the consistency wasnt my favorite and I didn't make it through the entire order. Besides I had to rush back to work. Two hours later I began to feel nausea, followed by violent projectile vomiting, and less than pleasant bowel movements. It took about three trips to the bathroom before I realized I had food poisoning. If you're going to have a business centered around food being handled in the open then you need to be on your a-game with cleanliness.

We tried two pasta dishes because the first one was so bad that we sent it back.. The second one was not much better and was left uneaten.  One of us actually got sick from the food. The rave reviews must be because people are so excited about a totally gluten free menu. But I have been gluten free since the 1960's and know how to cook.  The chef here did not. Too bad, but I definitely do NOT recommend this place.",1.0
"Just ordered delivery and was shocked at how awful the food tastes. The mashed potatoes tasted like they had vanilla soy milk in them, they were sickening. The Cajun shrimp filling is disgustingly fake and the side of marinara spaghetti was cold and the sauce tastes undercooked.

"Came here for a quiet Monday night dinner! 

Pros:
* On a Monday night we waited less than 5 minutes for a table- heard it gets super crowded later in the week
* Beautiful and spacious restaurant with modern decor 
* My friend and I loved the food- Gomaae Salad (this stuff is addicting, could eat bowls and bowls of this!), Shumai (came in 5 large succulent dumpling pieces), and Momoya Spicy Tuna Roll (although the pieces were a tad small for special roll, it was ""dangerously"" delicious). 
* Fast and friendly service
* If you don't get drinks Momoya is affordable for a higher-end Japanese place - for 2 shared appetizer and 1 roll, I paid $22.56 including tax and tip. Not bad. 

Cons:
* By dinner time Momoya ran out of their Kale dumplings, so we settled for Shumai instead, which turned out to be a good choice! 
* I gave Momoya 2 stars because only 10 minutes after paying the check, I started getting intense stomach cramps. Let's just say by the time I got home my stomach was extremely unhappy! My friend and I shared the salad and shumai and she felt fine...so my only guess is that I got sick from the Momoya Tuna Roll :( When I did a keyword search (sick, stomach, pain, ambulance)...I was shocked to discover other Yelpers who've had similar experiences and this goes back to 2009!

"I'm from the South and am constantly looking for a good queso in NYC! I've been wanting to try El Original for months ever since I read about it in several local publications, and I finally went last night. We ordered the queso, nachos (which were overkill with the queso--don't order both!) and the beef fajitas. The food was everything I wanted and more, although more expensive and still not as good as in the south. However, when my boyfriend went to the bathroom at the end of our meal he said it was deplorable. One toilet was clogged and the other was covered in vomit. Also, there was a leak. So that loses a star in my book, because it is just unacceptable for a diner to find the bathroom in that condition. 

The restaurant is out of the way for me, but I may be back one day. My boyfriend, however, who is a native New Yorker and couldn't care less about Tex Mex food, probably won't be.",1.0
"Went during my lunch break with a friend. With only an hour to spare, more then half of the time was wasted waiting for our food to come out. I ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad. The caesar dressing was extremely salty. Needless to say the grilled chicken was pretty good but it wasn't enough to balance out the salt. I managed to eat the entire salad because I was starving. I had a bite of my friends tasty beef sliders. I was willingly to come back and overlook the fact that my salad was over seasoned until I got back to the office I just didn't feel right. I had the stomach flips and felt nauseous. Getting sick off the food is just something I can't look past. I won't be going back.",1.0

Pros:
Food was acceptable
The price of the drinks, especially the margarita pitchers is a steal
Waiter service was nice and quick to respond

Cons:
The place itself was dirty, my girlfriend got sick immediately after eating there. Seriously if the restaurant has a yelp, then read this and make sure the ceiling and vent shafts you have air blowing in are clean.

Some of the policies the establishment have also deter customers from even staying there to eat or even drink. Especially if we are already exceeding the minimum amount asked for when ordering the quantities of alcohol and food. Asking for a minimum per person itself when the bill is most likely going to be near 70-100 dollar range due to the quantity already ordered.

Otherwise give this place a proper inspection, if you see it's cleaned up",1.0
The last time I ate at Boston market I got sick the chicken is not cooked when you put six or seven chicken's in the oven at the same time is never going to cook the same way. The way they check it they put a thermometer I guess it has to be a certain degree to be done but its not done. I will never eat at Boston Market again I'll go next door to the Chinese buffet at least their food is cooked. I gave them one star what I meant was no star's. Fix the oven that would make it better. The green's and macaroni and cheese taste like water please fix these problems.,1.0
I am so stupid. I should be ridiculed for ever going back after writing that review. I went back because my friend was attending a gathering there and I had no choice. I ordered an IPA and it was warm and tasted so disgusting I had to run outside to vomit because the bathrooms were full. Most likely full of people hovering over the toilets in attempt to not get hepatitis from sitting on them. The only thing I like about this place is how much I would like to see it on bar rescue,1.0

"I concur with another Yelper.

In the passing of my food travels one tossed salad at $6.50 was despicable horrible!!  The customer service was entirely cold, impersonal, rude, callous, and very unwelcoming.  When asked about my order for one toss salad, the server immediately started to put a lot of veggies (peppers, cherry tomatoes) into the mixing bowl without asking what I want.  I do not like peppers and I am not a fan of cherry tomatoes but I prefer sliced tomatoes.  How is it that a complete and total stranger know what I want in my tossed salad WITHOUT asking what I want/like?  EEK!! I requested Honey Mustard, which I got, and on the side I also got mayonnaise.  As the day worn on, this salad resulted in one giant case of diarrhea and a date with the porcelain throne.

Upon payment I requested a takeout menu which the cashier turned away from me shouting at his coworker in Spanish only to go into deaf ears as there was no response.  Thereby upon payment I asked, yet again, for a takeout menu only to finally receive a measly response ""no.""  The staff have extremely poor people skills and absolutely no communication skills.

"I went to Sushi Tokyo on Coney Island Avenue on Sunday evening with my family. I had the leo roll (made with raw tuna fish). I woke up at 6am Monday morning with an extremely painful stomach ache. It could have only been caused by the sushi, as I'd not eaten anything else on Sunday that could have been bad. I began vomiting violently without being able to stop. I was in absolute agony. I was sweating profusely. I couldn't drink anything and was dehydrating rapidly. My husband had to rush me to the emergency room where I had to be given an IV drip. It was confirmed that I had severe food poisoning. My experience has taught me a lesson to always keep in mind for future: Eating raw fish is always a risky proposition. You have no idea how fresh the fish is, and you cannot taste that it is bad.
When I called the manager to tell him my experience (Michael Parnavsky), he said he was sorry and could give me a store credit for my meal. He said the policy is to only give refunds within the day of eating the meal. I guess I should have thought to call while I was suffering in the emergency room. I certainly will not be going back there ever again, and their customer service is pitiful.",1.0
"I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews for this place. Being a huge fan of L'Artusi, I decided to check out L'Apicio. 

1. Arancini Balls-I love love love arancini, and these had fontina in it, which I also love x 3. These were bland and salted heavily, I think to cover up the blandness--and I think you really have to go out of your way to make a sausage and fontina filling bland. You have to shoot for the bland stars. The description on the menu said there was sage it in, but in fact there were simply really salty, crispy pieces of sage on the side. I am an over-salter, so if it is too much for me, it's probably too much for most people.

2. Lamb Ragu Pappardelle-Good and hearty. 

3. Calamari Ragu - Interesting concept. Loaded with capers, the pasta tasted really fresh, though the calamari was a little fishy (both in smell and quality--I had a touch of food poisoning after this experience, but I'm not docking points for that because hey, it's New York). It was good, but quite tart, so if that's not your thing, don't order it. 

4. Broccoli Rabe side - Delicious.

Overall, everything was good but not great. The ingredients weren't that fresh either.",1.0
"I decided to get some food here because I had to stop by to buy a few tickets for an event. (They sell tickets for various parties in NYC) 

A friend of mines told me I should get the fish and chips with everything( condiments) on it. I called ahead of time and placed my order- the woman on the other end said 15-20mins before it's ready. Upon picking up my food, I got a glimpse of it and let me tell you, it looked so delicious. In all honesty, it was really delicious. The fish tasted just right and the chips ( seasoned potato wedges) were seasoned and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed it. Also, it was a lot of food for $9. I couldn't finish it. I offered some to my boyfriend, but he politely declined, as he does not eat from just any restaurant or anyone. 

Well best decision of his life! I woke up with the worst- I repeat WORST diarrhea. I was so sad because I really enjoyed the food, but NO food on earth is worth such vial diarrhea.  the food was clearly not handled/ prepared well. I will not be trying Island burger again! 

Two stars because the food was good, but they lost three because if anything, food should be prepared properly. Focus on cleanliness first and flavor second.",1.0
"This place will make you sick to your stomach
So we moved to the neighborhood a few months ago. Being a huge pizza aficionado, eating it at least once a week, I tried this place. At first was so excited at the variety of slices but then I noticed something. Everytime I ate a slice here of any kind, I spent the night with painful stomach cramps and sick to my stomach in the bathroom. So I completely quit this place. Tried this place again the other day after thinking that perhaps I was being too hard on them or else how could they still be in business... Ordered 2 plain slices and alas spent the night with the worse stomach cramps in the bathroom I wouldn't wish on anyone. 
After reading other reviews of the lack of hygiene used at this place and also other yelpers who have reported spending the night on the toilet after eating here- please avoid for ur own sake- unless your looking to lose a few pounds in water weight the next day",1.0
I went here for lunch expecting a nice hearty meal of American food to cure my hangover and ended up feeling sick from the disgusting food I had. I first had the turkey club with guacamole but the turkey was so grey and slimy that I sent it back in fear that I would get food poisoning. After that I just asked for a cheese quesadilla because I was so turned off. I can't believe the chef could not even make a simple quesadilla. There was a sickening amount of cheese to the point where I had to spit it in my napkin to avoid gagging from chewing so much. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the two waitresses who served me were so freaking sweet and good at their job. Maybe they should find a new place to work.,1.0

"We made reservation online for dinner at Blue Ribbon at 35 Downing St (saturday July 19, 2014) but the only time slots open were 545 and after 915 pm. While we had dinner there between 545 to 715, there were few empty tables. We ordered a rack of lamb ($50), fried chicken ($28) and hamburger with blue cheese ($18), nothing was of acceptable quality for the prices charged. The lamb flavor was plain, the burger and the blue cheese tasted funny and my friend was sick from it afterward. I had better fried chicken at Popeye and KFC. I would never go back again. NEVER. It is not worth the $125, dinner for 3. I could have gotten a better meal at a diner for alot less.",1.0
I have been here twice and both times the food was terrible. I had a burger here that got me sick. After this place reopened I came here with a friend and got artichoke dip. The dip tasted sour like the cheese turned. At the same time the dip tasted like mostly spinach and the dip was mostly oil. It was the worse dip I had in quite a while. The store bought dip would have been much better.,1.0
"I've been here so many times because it's the only Viet place on SI.  I don't know why I never left a review, but here it is now!  (Side note - I just discovered there is another Viet place in New Dorp so I must try that place to compare!).  

For as long as I could remember, the spring rolls here are not like the spring rolls I've gotten in the Viet places in Chinatown, 8th Ave or Flushing.  These spring rolls are thinner, less meaty and the skin is different.  I love to eat Viet spring rolls so every time I come here and order these spring rolls, I feel that disappointment all over again because these spring rolls are not the ones that I am used to.  I still order them even though I know they are made differently.  This place would certainly have 4 stars from me if they can just change the way they make their spring rolls.  I feel this place skimps out on them so that is a major fail to me.  Usually the spring rolls are super thick and meaty, but these are anorexic thin.  

I've had the pho and pork chops here.   The pork chop on rice is literally what it sounds like - a piece of grilled pork chop on white rice.  It's pretty tasty and the pieces they give you are decent sized.  I love the orange colored sauce they give you so you could pour it over your rice and pork chop.  

As for the pho, the pho here is good.  I can't say it is the best, but if you are feeling for some pho and you're stuck on the island, come to Pho Mac.  The only thing I have to add to this is that I've gotten food poisoning here before from the pho (#1).  I'm sure it was an isolated situation since I've been back many times, but I just wanted to put it out there that I got sick.  It's been years since that incident and I've been back countless times however.",1.0
"Up until the other day I was ordering from colala for months, and my stuff came fresh and tasty - for the most part. Although, there were a couple of times where they left items out of my purchase, which they said that they would give the item to me the next time I ordered but they did not. Also, I had an episode where I had FOOD POISONING after eating the japanese seafood soup. Not sure what it was, I bought it all of the time, but it was probably old fish. In any event, I was sick for 4 days straight, vomiting and number 2, I KNOW TMI, but listen I have a very strong stomach and I almost never vomit , it was insane to me, and now I cannot and will not think of buying anything from them again. Also, most times I get a rude delivery man that takes my tip without saying thank you, no eye contact, not even a hello when I greet him. This place is a no go guys, order at your own risk!",1.0
"First time back to SB since the change. First let me  say the decor is awesome and inviting, but unfortunately that's where my rave review ends, I prefer the old SB with a bigger menu over this ""high end"" five guys. The burger was OK nothing to rave  about but it was not worth the price. The fries were greasy and over cooked. The shakes and soda are tasty though. SB needed a decor facelift and maybe a small menu change but it didn't need a complete overhaul like they did,   I live on the other side of Staten island and used to take the drive for the the food but unfortunately I won't be back, five guys is better  not as pricy and closer to me.

"As a fan of Action Bronson' s show ""Fuck That's Delicious"" we specifically came here to try out the ""Drums of Heaven"" per the show. So we ordered the Drums of Heaven and split a cashew chicken entree. The  food was good but I felt super stuffed upon leaving even though I had just 1 appetizer and split an entree. The service ok. The staff isn't super friendly but they were cordial. Anyway, the next morning I started to become sick in my sleep. When I realized what was happening, I went strait to the bathroom. I basically threw up all the food from the evening prior. I didn't have a sip of alcohol not did I eat anything else that evening. I am certain it was the food from Taipan. My food just sat on my stomach all night and didn't even digest. And I was sick the following morning. I have read about the Halal processing plants and how more than a fair amount of them are not sanitary. I don't know of that is the case hare or not or maybe the seasoning didn't agree with me. But me being sick within 24 hours of consuming is enough for me to not come back. My husband was fine but my final verdict is eat at your own risk.",1.0

"This is the place you go to, when you don't want to spend a lot of money, but want to eat ALOT of different low-quality foods, that you'll regret eating 30 minutes later..

The price here is reasonable, I think $11 a person, no including drinks, which you have to order separately. This buffet has a lot of variety, as they offer a lot of different foods, and even have a sushi bar (be careful with the sushi bar, I don't touch it, a friend of mine however got extremely sick after eating sushi at a different buffet years ago).

The food, is just ehhh... its not that good, and is on the cheap side.. but I guess once you walk through that door, and pay the price of a BUFFET, you already agreed to trade quality for quantity and variety.

While I've never personally seen anything that would make me say this place is unsanitary, it just doesn't feel like the cleanest of places... the food is sitting out there, as many people, some of whom may not be the cleanest of people, are helping themselves to.

This is a place you go to, when you just stop caring about anything for the day.

Bottom line: cheap price, cheap quality, a lot of food, you'll regret eating in 30 minutes.. not a bad place to go to, I just wouldn't recommend going here more than once every 6 months lol.

I give this place 3 stars because the price is good, and the variety is good. and they have cheap desserts too. But the quality is below average.",1.0

A few minutes after I ate this food I became horribly sick and couldn't stop throwing up. I got scared and went to the hospital and was told I had food poisening. I called them back to tell them what happened and when I did they told me to hold on they already knew they had messed up so they hung up on me. When I called back they said they had said hello and nobody answered which was a lie. My advice to the owner of this location is to find better workers who enjoy their job and have no problem preparing fresh food for customers. Also replenishing sauces daily you can automatically tell these guys hate their jobs when you walk in this place. I was forced to take the day off because of this and for that reason I won't ever go back to this location and I do not recommend this location to anyone.

"This restaurant was decent.  Their service was very fast, which was nice. Additionally their bathroom is very clean as well. 
As an appetizer, I had the flowering chive and vegetable roll. It was only two rolls, and it was pretty expensive. It was tasty, and the chives combined well with the crunchiness out the outside shell. The roll overall was pretty good, but was SOAKING in unnecessary grease. I also had the Bean Curd (tofu) on their list of rice plates, and the portion was immense! The vegetables were fresh, crunchy, and fantastic. The sauce it came with was very palatable and the rice was steaming hot, as it should be. However, the tofu/bean curd did not meet my expectations, as it was not cooked all the way.
At the end, the price came out pretty decently and I tipped well because I received good service.

"First time trying this place with hubby so this place gets a low rating because I literally got food poisoning from the food here. 

Thai food I've eaten plenty of times mostly in manhattan or around Elmhurst queens. I've never ever had problems with the food. I was excited to find a Thai place around Astoria so we gave it a try. 

Hubby and I ordered a lot too:

Appetizers:
Coconut shrimp- 2/5 not crispy at all and it says on the menu crispy out was soggy and sweet.

Calamari- 3.5/5 a bit chewy yet crispy

Entree:
Spare ribs- 1/5 nice presentation but looks can be deceiving 

Fried chicken- didn't try it hubby only picked at 2 and he didn't enjoy it much

Chicken pad Thai- 0/5 super sweet period.

Dessert:

Fried ice cream- 4/5 loved this a lot and how it was served flaming pretty cool!

Drinks: 

Hubby had chrysanthemum green tea which was delicious so that gets a 5.

I had Thai ice tea- 2/5 couldn't finish it

***UPDATE***  I ended up becoming really sick from the massive amount of hot spicy pepper that basically ruined my food. I had stomach aches/cramps and diarrhea for 3 days after.

"I've been looking forward to coming to Alma for quite some time now, and What a disappointment. My boyfriend and I ate at Alma on Sunday, when we first arrived there the not so friendly hostess told us the waiting time for the rooftop would be 20-30 minutes; we decided to wait downstairs by the bar, and 10 minutes later told our table was ready. (YAY) Although there were about 4-5 open tables, we were sat in a pretty small table with almost no space. The waitress came over and told us the ""Specials,"" a pomegranate blood orange margarita and a strawberry on the rocks margarita. We then ordered some guacamole and chips and the shrimp fajita and my boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas, with beans, and a cheesy rice on the side....

The Guacamole arrived and it was pretty good...... Right after our ""Special"" drinks arrived, and I must say they were the most disgusting margaritas I have ever tasted. The strawberry margarita tasted like pure grenadine... Grenadine comes from cherries not strawberries.... and the other margarita tasted like it was marinated in pure lemon juice, no simple syrup, no alcohol just pure lime juice! We tried explaining to the waitress, and she said thats just how they make it and she couldn't change it.... OKAY.......

Our food arrived, and it was a cheap edition of Mexican Food, my shrimps were RAW and tasteless, I was food POISONED after eating their raw shrimps...

My boyfriends food was pretty gross as well, his steak was cold and tasteless, the fajitas were also cold.

Please don't eat here. Unless you have an stomach for bugs and various germs.",1.0
"FOOD POISONING!! Chicken and eggplant w/ brown rice and hot sour soup.

I normally don't write reviews but just couldn't let this go by. I had gone here a few times back in 2012 but stopped because they refuse to put less soy sauce in my food when I explicitly ask. Forward to 2015, today I ordered a chicken and eggplant dish with brown rice and the hot sour soup. Ate it around noon and the stomach cramps came around 1pm. Had to leave work to go rest at home. Twisted in bed for about 4 hours and then the diarrhea kicked in. Feeling better now but definitely won't be coming back. 
And the dish today was again very oily and too salty. This is not close to real Chinese food. While Jade garden isn't much better in terms of quality at least you don't get food poisoning.",1.0
"Decent place to meet friends for drinks.

I went for midnight breakfast. So that's what THIS review is for.

You def need advance rsvp. 
Portions are very small...for what is suppose to be breakfast dish. And dishes were not ""breakfast"" like.

Prices were too high for portion/quality. $18 for a very small sandwich you can eat in 3-4 bites.  
My friend ordered this & sadly she was unfulfilled. Then had bad diarrhea at home. Thankfully I didn't ask for a bite..not that she could afford to share.

I had the duck hash. They must have forgot the duck...all I kept eating was potatoes. $18 for a pot of sauteed potatoes. Lucky for my hungry stomach, potatoes are filling...so that was the only benefit of that dish. Otherwise, I still wonder where if the 3 shreds of strings I saw were suppose to be the duck or were they potato skins?

I did get a side of biscuit. Nothing grand. 

I did not try any of the alcoholic drinks.

They had good DJ...crowd seems to be having fun.

I would not do the midnight breakfast again nor recommend it. I can come to have drinks or check out other events the venue offers.",1.0

"You can't go wrong with this heaping pile of meat (my preference is a mix of chicken and lamb) over rice and oodles of white and spicy sauce! Granted, every time I eat the platter, it leads to food poisoning. It's like that Dr Oz 2 day shred! NO KIDDING - EVERY TIME! And yet any trip to NYC is not complete without a trip to the halal guys. 

The only thing I don't like about the recent franchising is the quality is not the same. That's just the downside of franchising. There are so many dupe halal carts around the city that you easily have a hit or a miss. I know the lines used to wound down around the street but that was just part of the charm. 

And now I want a halal platter with that yummo white sauce! Anybody coming back from NYC?!",1.0

"The food here is as consistently good as you can expect. 

The problem? The seating policy. And people. 

For example, as I'm waiting for the vibrator to buzz, two young tourists sit down at a table without getting their food yet, cutting off a pregnant lady with her kid in tow. Poor mom is balancing a heavy tray full of chow to feed her starving children. But guess what? Euro tourists are hi-fiving each other for jumping the line to steal hard-working Americans' seats.

I usually don't say anything, because I am Asian and we are trained to just suffer. But I am also an American so sometimes people need to get punched in the face.

So I go to the two tourist dudes and say YO BRO, CAN'T YOU SEE THIS LADY NEEDS TO SIT DOWN? Y'ALL DON'T EVEN HAVE YOUR FOOD.

They pretended not to speak English, so I knew they were French. 

I waved down this lady who works there. She was like, AW HELL NAW DON'T COME AT ME WITH THAT JUNK I JUST WORK HERE So she got a manager.

The manager said, I'm sorry we don't have a seating policy. 

I was like, what? Look at that pregnant lady, she's about to pop out another one - let her have a burger first.

The manager said, we can't do anything. So sorry.

Oh really? Wild Wild Upper West Side? Fine, parlay vous #knucklesamwich But by that time the frenchmen got their frenchfries. Speaking of fries, switching from the crinkle cut to mcdonalds fries - what's your problem Danny Meyer? 

Back to the story, an adjacent table opened up. By opening up I mean I stood there until this group of teenagers felt uncomfortable enough to leave. Go squat at a Starbucks, frappers. So I ushered the pregnant mom and her kids to their seats. I hoped the employees or a real cute girl was watching but no. Only the good Lord. Then I got buzzed myself so I get my food. When I return, of course no tables are open, but the mom invites me to sit with them. I feel like Jerry Maguire. 

Then her little kid starts crying because she didn't get cookie dough or something in her shake. And as she was whining the entire time, the mom started to yell at her between bites of cheese fries and I realized she had a super-heavy New York accent. And I smelled something weird and I realized the little kid must have dogpoop on the bottom of her shoe, because, well, it is the upper west side. Or she went in her pants. 

I wondered if the frenchies had room at their table but they were gone, replaced by some uptown chick reading a copy of 50 shades of stupid.

I shoved my grub down the hatch, wished the lovely family a g'dday, mad-dogged the girl on the way out, she was pretty cute actually, aside from resting beach face, and had diarrhea for the rest of the day.",1.0

Don't eat at this diner. You will become sick like I did. I  ordered a cheese burger deluxe with waffle frys. After eating half the burger when I took the next bite a long hair was still connected to the greasy burger and the pickle had black dots on it and another strand of hair like it had been dropped on the floor and put on my plate. I sent it back and just waited for my check to pay for my diet doda and the waitress Angelica served the table next to me and they got up and left because they said that they found a fake acrylic nail in the  Greek salad with chicken and they showed it to the manager.  I have never been so grossed out . I wanted to vomit the chunks of the burger that were in my stomach. I keep seeing that fake nail with dark nail polish.  Don't go near the place.

Decor: The overall look of the place gave off the impression of not being well maintained. The table was slightly sticky but it could have been the material of the table. Bench had similar feel. It's clean for Chinatown, but not nice looking like other ramen shops around the city.

Taste: Presentation was pretty. It had a strong garlic taste. I wish it had more broth. But it's good ramen.

The same night I got food poisoning. 
I can't forget that the cheese was very sticky and was not cut good. Plus it's confusing how they only sell pies. I asked how much was the small one is he said 8.50 then went to wait and when it was ready he said it was 10.00! He said that he got the pecs confused and he said it in a rude voice.

The only reason I ate it was because I was absolutely starving after waiting 2 hours to eat. My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Fried Rice and took two bites of it and decided not to finish it. The two drinks that were comped for us were pineapple Ciroc and seltzer water with lime. A whole $12 that we were giving for a long wait and below average dinner after driving from Long Island and booking these reservations a week in advance. Oh yea and diarrhea for the next two days.

"I had passed by this restaurant a couple of times when I was around St. Mark's Place and the cute crab restaurant name logo looked really adorable and memorable.  So three days ago after Macaron day hopping I finally got to try out this restuarant. My big bro, friend and I came here after getting our free macaron at Macaron Parlour at 111 St. Marks Place. 

The inside decor was okay but the seating arrangement was not good because there were no place to hang the coats near the tables as the seats were stool style seats. Although, under the stool was a small section to store a bag but it wasn't very clean and I would not recommend placing a nice bag or coat there.  There was a communal hanger rod at the front of the restaurant but who wants to leave their coat/jacket there if their table is far away from the front of the main entrance. I feel they didnt think things through when they were designing the place. The least they should have are coat hooks on the side of the wall near the tables. 

We went in after seeing a printed paper menu outside that advertised $15 whole cooked lobster and 50% off all boils. The original menu have three boils crab leg ($45), Maine Lobster ($40), Shrimp ($30). All the boils came with corn, squid, shrimp, mussel, potatoes, and pasta.  The three of us each ordered a boil. My big bro and I each got the Maine lobster boil and my other friend got the vegetable boil which included carrots, corn, potatoes as she was allergic to shrimp, crab and lobster.  She had the clam as an add on for $10 more. The veggie boil was $10 by itself.  You had a choice of seasoning and spiciness.  I got the everything seasoning and non spicy, big mistake with the everything seasoning as it was too salty and too lemony sour. 

For appetizer we ordered one order of soft shell crab and shrimp with clams. The soft shell crab came with cucumber pickles and potato chips. It was quite yummy and I recommend it highly. This restaurant gain one star because of the soft shell crab that I liked otherwise I would had given them one star ONLY as that is the lowest rating that is allowed. 

The shrimp and clam appetizer was way too salty and the boils were way too salty, they lost one star for that. When we got our main entree the lobster boil, I thought it was only my lobster that was not fresh but my big bro lobster was also not fresh. Our lobsters were dead before they were cooked, as the meat was flaky and not whole. In addition you could just taste that it was not fresh at all. I didn't want to make a scene in the restaurant so I just ate my lobster but my bro told me he over heard the owner/manager say the lobster had problems and was not fresh but good thing they ate it. Not sure if he was hearing things but from the owner/managers expression and actions, I knew something was up. I was highly disappointed with this place as I had higher expectations for this place. Our bill came out to be $110 with tips and tax. My Big bro treated me and my other friend to this place.  But this place turn out to be a big disappointment, I would not come back. Also after eating the bad lobster my throat started to feel funny and a little sore, when I went home I had diarrhea and stomach pains. Although I don't think I had food poisoning, but I definitely know for sure the lobsters they serve was not fresh and not of good quality. Maybe thats why they are promoting lobsters for $15 and 50% off boils. I am not sure how this place got four star rating but from my experience they are really lacking in their food quality. Service was okay but not spectacular as the waitress did have some problems with my friends having seafood allergies but she did try her best to help accomodate by speaking to the chef. The two additional stars they lost for their bad lobster. I really regret ordering the lobster, I wish I had ordered the crab legs instead. My friend's veggie boil with add on clams was super salty too. Not sure how they cook their clams but it taste like they drenched it in salt. Can we say high blood pressure and heart attack. Oh my goodness! 

I gave this place a chance and never going back, their first impression rubbed me off the wrong way. If you want a good seafood boil place go try Boat House at 8th Avenue Brooklyn instead, you would be much happier.",1.0
"I usually order a salad here for lunch because of the convenience of picking my own ingredients. However, it is very pricey. A normal salad usually costs me about 9 dollars.

"I am normally an optimistic person, and the Buddha in me would like to believe this place will get over their negative marks but the realist in me is currently winning and I must recognize that this place is just a shoddy version of the better vegetarian / vegan brethren in the neighborhood. 

The Boo and I ordered a few things and I will itemize my review by them:
1) Spinach dumplings - I would like to start with the best dish we had here, which was still only a 2.0/5.0. The spinach dumplings which are highly praised in a couple other reviews are what drew our attention. I felt there was too much grain filling, and not enough of the good stuff. For what they were, it was just okay.
2) Flour flat noodles with fried dough inside - This was very disappointing. It tasted pre-made and re-heated. The fried dough was not crispy, the noodles were flavorless and just tasted wrong.
3) Pulled pork buns - These were okay. Another 2.0/5.0. I felt like they could use more flavor.
4) Fried banana - When ordering, I asked if it was vegan to which they said yes. I asked if any animal product was used, to which they said no. When it came out and I took a bite, I noticed a syrup on the bottom so figured I would ask - which turned out to be honey! I felt sick to my stomach. I could and do expect this at omni restaurants, but a vegetarian restaurant should understand the difference between vegetarian and vegan and should know what animal products consist of. This ruined my appetite and my mood, not to mention my stomach.

Go elsewhere and save yourself the dough / cash / stomach ache / head ache.",1.0
"I was excited about this spot as others (omnivores) have said it's great. We ordered a few items to try. Things we tried:

Almond coconut chicken (fried but lack of flavor, where's the coconut?)

Roti canai (tasted too much like massaman curry not like the sauce I'm used to vege or not, check out Nyona on Grand St). 

Creole soul chicken (I never use this fraze: meh, no flavor at all. I was excited for this. I love creole Cajun chicken, no spice no flavor. The mashed taters that came with were meh too.)

All in all its basically battered and fried soy protein, something akin to a morning star nugget. I got a little sick from all the soy protein. 

Maybe other folks are just excited about fried food, which I don't mind but give it some distinct flavors. 

I prefer Quantum leap on Sullivan street foe vegetarian dishes.

Went here for an oyster happy hour.  The oysters didn't come easily off their shell which should have been a sign that I took seriously. I ended up with terrible food poisoning which my doctor said was typical of bad shellfish.  Disappointing since I love oysters and this place is close by. This place is owned by the same people that own Macao trading co.,1.0
"First, there are no bread plates and when I asked for one, I was told they don't allow you to have one. Second, after eating, I felt ill; an hour later, I was throwing up. You'd expect that an upscale restaurant would not give you food poisoning.  Do not go here.",1.0

He proceeded to ""yell"" at my waiter & I was served my original request. End of story? I only wish. Later that night i had the worst case of food poisoning ever. Heaving all night. Was it a coincidence? I think not. If i had real proof i would be doing a lot more than just Yelping about it.   BEWARE.",1.0

Second, two orders at our table of four people were wrong and had to be sent back.

Sanitary Violations
1) Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.
2) Live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.
3) Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.

The next day I woke up with a terrible stomach ache and was sick all day. The only thing I could think of was the last thing I ate which was the red snapper from blend. My date had chicken and was fine the next morning. I was late to my 1115pm reservation on a Saturday night but the wait was still ridiculous considering the fact that there were numerous empty tables! It looked like no one wanted to do anything but close. It took me forever to order a drink at the bar while I waited to be seated and bar wasn't packed. Once we were seated it took about 25 mins for our server to come take our order. Ridiculous at this point where it's late and the restaurant isn't busy. It took about 5 mins for my fish and my dates chicken to come out. Fresh? I don't think so! We ordered drinks the same time as the food and that came way after our food did. I had high hopes for blend and so did my date and we were both very disappointed. One star for the gentlemen running around looking like he was doing everything (mgmt I assume) who was the only one who asked us about our table and got us seated after I had spoke to the hostess numerous times. After they called us saying out table was ready it took about 15 minutes to actually be seated in a restaurant with plenty of empty seats. It was only 2 of us. This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a very long time. It's upsetting!! because of all the good reviews I've heard and read.,1.0
Not sure what on earth has happened here but its not good. Seemingly overnight several of the wonderful long time staff are gone and the whole vibe of the place has changed. No longer the place that I've grown to love and where I've gone religiously for the last several years.The coffee has gone back to being inconsistent - generally dependent on who is making it. And when its bad it borders on undrinkable. The food has also gone downhill and the salads which I used to have multiple times a week have made me feel sick the last several times I've had them. It seems that someone made some really bad decisions. Truly a shame.,1.0

Visit #1 they were training a girl on how to wrap/ roll a burrito.  Are you serious? You are having a trainee practice on my burrito?   Lets say I should have gone with the bowl because that is how bad she was.  Practice on some fake food or not on the front line. Visit #3 the soda machine was out of C02; when I try to tell this to the register they had no  clue what I was talking about or how to fix it.

Went with the boyfriend because of a sudden sushi craving and returned home with STOMACH POISONING. 

We ordered several pieces of sushi and noticed the salmon roe was completely off. It tasted rotten and when we notified the waitress and she said she would check with the chef. Supposedly their salmon roe supply just arrived that very morning. Now I don't care if it was the fault of the supplier, the chef not being clean with the food, or the management for allowing this very obviously rotten food to be served but never again. Can never be careful enough with ingesting raw food of any kind. Plus, the rice they use always tastes old and is too hard (most likely is old rice that's been refridgerated and then reheated).",1.0

"I have tried Sushi Shop in both Madrid and Paris, generally the quality isn't amazing, but its reliable, you know what you'll get when you order from any shop. You'll get a relatively simple roll that satisfies the basic craving for sushi and you'll leave knowing that you got exactly what you came for. The delivery in these countries was also of comparable quality, so would be reason enough to assume the NY branch would comply. Or so I thought. Yesterday, I bought one of the box specials of 24 rolls that comes with a bonus side order. 

However, the bonus was not the Miso Soup that they packaged in the delivery bag, oh no. The bonus was the food poisoning that left me bed ridden and running to the bathroom more times than I could count. The fish tasted only a little bit off but more or less the flavor profile that I would expect from Sushi Shop, and I didn't touch the Miso Soup because I no longer was hungry and already started feeling a little uneasy. I had to cancel several appointments and needless to say did not have much fun or happy feelings at all yesterday.

Yesterday we went post valentines for a few noodles and one of us got extreme food poisoning from the pork. We think it was undercooked or left out for a long time at sub hot temp,. I've alerted 311 and reported it to the health dept.

"DO NOT COME HERE!!! I don't understand the hype of this place because the food isn't even particularly good. This was my only meal today and It gave me food poisoning. I told them the crab was not fresh because it had a really funky, fishy smell and I've had plenty of crabs in my life to know the difference between spoiled and fresh. My waitress insisted that it was fine when I was positive it had went bad. Then she bought new ones out and I ate them thinking they're fine. They have to be the culprit since my friend had everything I ate besides the crab and he is completely fine. Don't waste your money here, unless you want to spend all night by the trash can puking your guts out. There are better options in Chinatown.",1.0

I went to this restaurant 7/16 where I had the seafood combination with noodles prepared on the hibachi. I could not complain about the cook as he was funny and entertaining. I will state that I became violently sick after just an hour or so. I had to go to the emergency room where it was later determined that I had food poisoning. I called the restaurant because I felt this should be shared. The GM stated that he would check the kitchen and call me back. He did in a half hour stating their policy is only to pay medical bills (I have insurance). My suggestion was that I be refunded for my meal not only as a good faith gesture but because of the spin I suffered and am currently suffering due to eating a meal at this restaurant. This wasn't honored. I will never return to this establishment in fear of being food poisoned again.,1.0
"I really liked this place. Thought it was the most authentic place in midtown. Ordered from here many times until I had food poisoning!

"We had dinner there last night, first time for any of the four of us. The room is certainly pleassnt, we had drinks  at the bar while we waited for our friends to arrive. The bar tender was polite and efficient. Our friends arrived and we went to our table. It was some time before anyone came with water, but when they did, we ordered sparkling. Though when they eventually came to refill the water, they mixed in still, more than  once. One of our friends that joined us waited at least 15 minutes before we could flag someone down to take he drink order. She ordered a Jack Daniels on the rocks. When it finally  arrived,  and she tasted it, it turned out to be scotch. It took some time to flag downa waiter again, was anyone assigned to our table, and when she explained the issue with the drink,  he apologized and disappeared withe the scotch.  After more  time went by, he reappeared, to announce they were out of Jack Daniels. She asked what bourbon they did have...he didn't know. She asked him to find out. After  some more time went by, he plopped a drink down in front of her, only telling her what it was after she pressed him for the information. It had been 50 minutes from the time we sat down, until she finally had a glass of bourbon. Though it was Saturday night. The place was not crowded. The staff seemed t o be tripping over each other, delivering the wrong orders to half of us. When it did arrive, it was tasty and  bountiful., though they continued to pour the wrong water all night
 There were three steak orders, and I had the lobster ravioli. When I got home from the restaurant,  I became violently I'll with vomiting and diarrhea.  None of my dinner companions got ill,  so I am guessing v it was the lobster. Though the manager did check in with us as we were leaving, we didn't care to launch into how lousy the service had been, for over $100 a person, choosing rather to leave and avoid the confrontation

"My boyfriend & I have ordered delivery from Goodfella's Gramercy three times since we moved to the area. We decided to order delivery on the Monday the 22nd before the holidays, figured it would be a treat to relax and take it easy since a lot of family cooking was approaching us...

We ordered two orders of sautéed spinach, an order of meatballs and the buffalo salad with chicken. I had two bites left of my sautéed spinach when I noticed a giant roach at the bottom of the dish. I immediately ran to the bathroom to vomit and got extremely upset that I actually consumed the entire dish before noticing something so horribly disgusting.

Since we only live half a block away, we didn't bother opening the rest of our order and walked it back to Goodfella's Gramercy. We spoke to a gentleman at he front desk who told us ""this never happens here"" and the typical response. We paid in cash and asked for a refund, considering I got stomach sick and returned the rest of our order, you'd think we would get our money back. No. 

The man told us he is unable to give refunds because his manager just left the country for the holidays. He said that we could give our name & complaint and come back after the New Year to get our money back. Well, we did that. We just went this evening and got the same story! We had a $60+ order, that was thrown up and thrown away and we have not been given respectable customer service at all.

This establishment clearly has an unsanitary kitchen with roaches & SERVES food with bugs for take out! If they would have refunded us properly and respectably then I would never come forward with this issue. But since they have terrible customer service & a bug problem to boot, other diners should be warned.",1.0
"Quality & service really took a nose dive this past weekend at JoJu.
We ordered three banh mi sandwiches and it took over 30 minutes to complete.

They said they were short staff in the kitchen but from what I see the four were moving in slow motion. You can tell they are inexperienced.

The cashier was quick and tried to help and kept apologizing for the slowness.
The orders came out in random orders and not in order of submission.

A guy way ahead of us was also pissed when several orders came out before his.
we had the same problem, 3-4 trays of banh mi orders that came behind us was served ahead of us.

One of the order had spicy sauce on it and my daughter got seriously sick from it.
So their quality control is lacking too.

My sandwich was filled in the middle only; both ends of the bread had NOTHING but bread!

The service was very good ,the food seemed fine.My husband enjoyed his meal my meal which was seafood seemed fine ,  I say seemed fine because everything was fine until We were on our way home .I started having severe stomach cramps and broke out into a cold sweat.It was horrible I made it home and experienced terrible diahrea which continued throughout the night,I had my daughter call immediately and notify the restaurant,she did and spoke to Michael (the manager) he asked for my phone number and did call the next day to see how I was feeling I felt weak and my stomach still unsettled but alittle better.After thinking about it  I felt  I should  at least be entitled to a refund only on my meal.I was told this is not their policy and I can come in for a steak on them .I 'm sorry to say I'm not comfortable running back to a restaurant that I had such a terrible experience at.Instead of prolonging this I wrote to their corporate office and asked for the amount of my dinner in a gift card to use if I choose at a later date.I haven't heard back and assume that was not their policy either, I can't imagine a restaurant of this caliber is not interested in proper customer service.I feel the gift I was given was for nothing,nothing more then me getting sick.I realize this is rare but unfortunately it did happen.I don't feel my request is unreasonable,apparently they do.",1.0

"How do corporations get away with serving such shit!!!!!
It boggles my mind. Maybe we are just programmed to eating bad food, being seduced by nice images with sprays of fresh lemon and sizzling oil. And yes Red Lobster is a corporation owned by Golden Gate Capital. I have never eaten at a Red Lobster but when we were in Harlem and my partner was in the mood for lobster, I took his suggestion for around the corner Red Lobster. Large two level space, big rent no doubt, fake poster art, diner type brown booths. The laminated menu was many pages of yummy looking images and I had an open mind. First came the drinks, my partner had a frozen margarita that was so huge you could swim in it. Premise #1 people are stupid, give them something big and they won't care whether it is good or bad, well he had two minutes of brain freeze, then sugar shock, if you don't have diabetes you will be introduced through this super sized junk. My drink of choice was a grey goose martini with olives pretty straight up. The drink I was served was pale yellow the color of wine served in a wine glass!!!! WTF. I tasted, tried and thought I could swallow, but not. It seems upon asking that they added lots of olive juice into it, bartender alert (!) My waitress the BEST BEST part of this experience,  was attractive, accommodating and pleasant, replaced my drink, clear, olive on top and in actual martini glass. Who knew they had this, why the wine glass in the first place?
Now for the food: Wooohoo.. Shared appetizer, limp lettuce wrap, shrimp not bad, drowned in SWEET sauce with a silly shredded something (again give people something sweet and they will eat shit)  no jalapeños as described. The rest of the meal continued in this vein, tasteless, same overused silly shredding. In the end for two drinks one shared appetizer and two entrees, no dessert $100.00. What a rip off in terms of food quality and dining experience. We got home and my partner spent the rest of the night between vomiting and diarrhea, his stomach is not used to bad food. I can tell you this that the investors in Red Lobster don't eat there, ever. they just sell it to hardworking families as a lovely dining experience. It is not good for you, don't take yourself or your children there and If you are lazy and don't revolt, they will keep selling you this shit for a lot of money.",1.0
"Here is the anonymous letter that I wrote to the management:

Owner/Manager
Great Wall
104-37 Queens Boulevard
Forest Hills, NY 11375-3757
November 15, 2013

Subject: Getting DIARRHEA from your restaurant

Dear Madam/Sir:

After getting sick several times from another take-out Chinese restaurant in the community I decided to try your restaurant instead.

I've included the menu that came with my order though I've removed my contact information.

I ordered a large Won-Ton soup, two eggrolls, Singapore Chow Mai Fun and Moo-Shu Chicken and upon delivery I ate some of everything and I got DIARRHEA; don't shake your head or go into denial-mode; I GOT DIARRHEA.

The next day I finished the left-over Singapore Chow Mai fun and didn't get sick at all so obviously the problem has to be somewhere in the other three dishes.

Obviously, from the number of people in your place I'm not the only one that feels this way; most customers will not bother confronting you with their getting sick, they'll just stop coming to your business.

If I still get sick, I will then no longer patronize your restaurant, it's really that simple.

I don't care that you get to post an ""A"" in your window and, by the way, I'm not necessarily going to complain about your place to the local health authorities but I am telling YOU but to be honest, complaining to the local health department will still be an option that will remain on the table.

I do not get sick in my own kitchen so it is obvious that you're doing something very wrong in running your restaurant; if you don't know proper food handling procedures then I suggest you go into another business.
 
One last thing; you may be doing everything right but there could be one employee that is deliberately sabotaging your efforts; if this might be so then get rid of this person; he's obviously wrecking your business.

Sincerely yours
""A Friend In The Community""",1.0
"Went here Saturday night for a birthday dinner with a large group. We were seated at our reserved table. However, the restaurant got the party size wrong and we were short two seats. Once everyone was finally seated (practically on top of each other), we waited awhile before the waiter came over to take our drink order. We had to request to have bread brought to the table. Then it took about an hour for the waiter to take our dinner order. 

After waiting forever for our food, it finally came and we ate. The food was not that good for the price we paid. I had the filet mignon which was not seasoned well. The sauce had no real flavor. To make matters worse, I became sick after eating. I got home and basically never left my bathroom for two days. 

I think this restaurant is completely overrated. I've had better food for equal or less in price and the service was horrible. It's definitely a restaurant I would not recommend anyone going to. Don't let the name and location fool you.",1.0
"I have worked for Paradise biryani for few months. The owner of this restaurant Maduh reddy (pantulla) is very cheapest guy I have ever seen in my life. He never paid salary to most of his ex employees which is illegal. current employees get paid once in a 4 months,so employees are very careless & most of them are not holding food handlers & hygiene certificate which is very much important to work in restaurants in New York City.  

The reason to write this review is all New Yorkorkers should know the truth behind, how this guy runs this restaurant in New York city. This place is not regularly pest controlled because of owners cheap thinking & the result is you can see the rats & cockroaches roaming in the restaurant everywhere.The people those who eats here at Paradise, they often complaint about food poisoning. Biryanis are not fresh in this restaurant because they just make the biryanis & store in the fridge for 3 days. Desserts are even store in the fridge for more than a month before serving to the customers. The food is very expensive & most of the times its uncooked or tasteless because they dont know what exactly they are making. This place is selling just a spicy pulao rice under the name of hydrabadi biryani.",1.0
"One star is far more than they deserve!  The fish tacos consist of 99% breading. They slather a thick mayo spread over it making it even less appetizing and extremely gooey.  I was starving when they arrived and ate four of them at about 1:30pm.  One hour later, I felt sick to my stomach and was completely out of commission until about 6:45pm.  At 7pm I called to report the issue and spoke with a manager who was quite defensive.  He told me that they had served them all day long and no one had complained.  He kept repeating this over and over again until I hung up.  He called me back and repeated the same mantra.  This is poor customer service in my book.

Rosa Mexicano, my place of choice for fish tacos, was not delivering today which is the only reason I ordered from Ponche.  Had I contacted them with a complaint they would have listened to me and made it right.  For example, the one and only time we had an issue with an order was when they forgot the tartar sauce.  Within 30 minutes, they brought additional fish tacos, salad and flan with a brownie crust and whipped cream!

Skip the food.

"Being that there is a Cajun restaurant in ASTORIA I was extremely excited! I have eaten Cajun food down south so I had a rough idea of what to expect. I ordered the blackened shrimp and the Catfish. Both dishes were not seasoned well, and my friend actually got sick immediately after eating the fish. The fries that came with the entree were alright (also under-seasoned), and the salad was bland. Usually Cajun food comes with some kind of seasoned rice, so I felt a little slighted getting a salad. On the upside, the ambiance is eclectic and cute.

I heard the dishes to order are the fried chicken and the mac&cheese. Sadly, I won't be returning to try them. If you can't serve a good fish entree, you probably shouldn't advertise as ""Cajun""",1.0

We were polite enough not to ask our money back. But, we informed them about the cheese so that other customers don't get sick. Then couple of days later, we tried their biryani, it was old, smelled off, just warmed up, very oily and not tasty at all. I had to buy extra yogurt sauce to be able to eat some of it.

I am a frequent restaurant eater in the neighborhood as I don't cook at home at all; though I went back to Punjabi Tadka almost after a year.

It's not just because of the food poisoning...which I got from what I think was the guacamole...it was because of the way they (the female manager) handled it/me.

Anyway, the lady manager I spoke with, refused to believe that it was their fault, and refused to apologize. Literally.

To be clear, the reason I am giving a ""1"" is not because of the food poisoning. I could probably get over that. The reason I am giving a ""1"" is because of the female manager.

Also, while I was dining there, I overheard the manager being a jerk to a costumer who was concerned about their bill. He felt the bartender was overcharging for a house shot, and the manager's reply, ""Well sir, I'm not sure if you're aware, but this isn't a street bar.""",1.0
Food Poisoning. Ordered the chicken korma and some samosas (as part of the dinner special) and was up sick the whole night afterwards.  It was delicious but not worth the experience after the fact.,1.0
"While it is very difficult to only give Westville, 1 star after my recent experience with the restaurant, the East Village location in particular, I have no choice. I have been a frequent diner at their restaurant for years and have been to multiple locations. I love what their restaurants stand for: delicious, fresh food without having to break the bank. Unfortunately after my last experience however, I am no longer going back. After eating at Westville East for breakfast with my family, I experienced THE WORST food poisoning of my life. It ruined the remainder of the weekend and when I called them to report it, for the most part they could care less. I understand that this is something that happens with restaurants. Food poisoning whether it is experienced by one guest or multiple guest can happen to the best. But to show absolutely no remorse is beyond me. They basically said ""What do you want us to do about it?"" and never got back to me. In a city like New York with so many options and so many factors, treating customers properly is something you have to take into account regardless of how strong your reputation is and how good the food can be.",1.0

"If I could give zero stars I would. Got pretty bad food poisoning from this place. Hopefully this isn't something that happens here everyday but, if your food gets me to throw up later in the day, you don't really get second chances as a restaurant no matter what.
P.S. it was most likely their sweet and sour kebab that did the poisoning.",1.0
The ambiance was nice. So that's why I gave 2 stars. To be totally honest... Maybe the chef should revisit a food health and sanitation course because I have food poisoning from uncooked wings. I bit into one and it still tasted like the fridge. Why are they using frozen wings??? I sent the wings back. Then the bartender offered me ribs so instead of making a big stink I just ordered something else. The ribs cAme and they were not done. Pork will kill you if not prepared correctly or anything for that matter. Well now I have been pissing through my ass for the last 3 days. One of my co-workers even received a dirty glass filled with wine. Come on!! This is why businesses don't last. I really had fAith in this business and that's in the toilet along with my guts.,1.0
"I love Treehaus, I do. I want to say the best things about it, really. I eat breakfast there often and sometimes even catch lunch. They switch up the menu often enough that you can avoid feeling bored and still get a chance to retry something you found out you loved the other day.

My only real problem with them is the cleanliness. I've had a co-worker hospitalized due to food poisoning from some of their hot plate breakfast food. Not to say the food was so spoiled it put her in the hospital - but she just had a severe reaction to it (perhaps due to personal digestion problems). I've once picked up a Chobani yogurt from there that was a part of the huge recall conducted last year for mold. That Chobani had bum yogurts isn't the restaurants fault - but I purchased it off their shelves almost a week after the recall had been announced (I only found out about it by searching to see if their was a reason mine smelled rancid). 

When they used to leave their bagels and cream cheese out in the open about a month back, I saw plenty of fruit flies gathering on or around the bready products. Uncovered. Nothing, just left to the air.

My ultimate point being: yes, 8/10 times they get it right. But yesterday I bought lunch there and there were still rather large chicken feathers fried into the skin of my ""KFC"" style chicken of theirs. I don't know if I'm allowed to upload photos of uncleanliness their Yelp page but I sent this in to 311: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvbSF1DIIAAHB0y.jpg 

It's been reported to the department of health and hygiene but I also brought it up to one of the employees who attempted to make up for it by offering me a free plate of food. I would have accepted but... you know, I was there to complain about the food and didn't really want MORE?

I'm taking a break from eating there for a while until they get their act together and get an A rating.",1.0

I have been here twice and everything is really good. They do especially well with things that are grilled- grilled octopus is amazing and even grilled asparagus was remarkable.

"I ordered the Jerk Chicken and the Goat Roti. 

It took over an hour for the food to arrive-- and the shop is only 5 minutes away from my house. The only good thing about this dish is the roti skin. The goat and potatoes were one big mush and i am SURE that the food was a few days old. On top of it all, I am suffering a mild case of food poisoning. 

As for the jerk chicken, it tasted as if they reheated food from yesterday. My husband didn't take more than one bite. 

PLEASE do not order from here.",1.0

"I used to love this place. LOVE. Then as it got trendier, the food got cheaper and less amazing. Then I just liked / tolerated this place. Came for the brunch. Eventually even brunch left a bit to be desired, and with that B on the door, one could only assume it was earned by the dirtiness of those glasses and silverware. (Brown slime on my coffee cup??)

"DISGUSTING. Everything about my evening here was disgusting. 
The place is was freezing. Service was seriously lacking. The appetizer (mushroom bisque) was medicore. The guacamole was the worst I ever had. The entree (skirt steak) tasted nothing like steak, not to mention it was cold. I sent it back to the kitchen, where they microwaved it and returned it in 45 seconds. Are you serious? I almost broke my tooth on the cookie ice cream dessert. The cookie was as hard as a brick. The waiter did not care that we were unsatisfied; he bluntly ignored us. NOT TO MENTION THAT I GOT FOOD POISONING. I do not know how this establishment has not been closed down yet.",1.0
"If I could rate this place a 0 I would. Came here with my girlfriend and was seated only to be forgotten about. I had to call a waiter over to have our order taken.

We ordered vegetable dumplings, vegetable spring rolls, a miso soup and our entrees which were pad Thai and tofu with bok Choy and shitaki mushrooms. The spring rolls were a joke and literally were the size of half a pinky. The dumplings were mediocre, the miso soup was pretty decent, and our entrees were horrid. The pad Thai had mint in it which ruined it and the boy Choy with the tofu and mushrooms was gross and I basically got food poisoning from it.  Suffice it to say, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Also they had workers sleeping on the second floor of this place which is really sketchy.",1.0

I used to be really into this place. I live a few doors down so it was always super convenient for a quick bite. I used to eat here at least once a week. The time before last I noticed it wasn't as good. I then decided hey what the heck. I really like Five Tacos I will give then another chance. But then - about 15 minutes after eating it I started to feel horrible. I broke out into sweats. My stomach aching terribly making me want to scream. I've been sick for 3 days straight now. I can't even look towards Five Tacos anymore. I don't know what happened.,1.0
"HORRIBLE sushi. I ordered on seamless and the fish was rotten. Definitely tasted like it had been sitting out for days. When I called the restaurant to complain they told me the fish had been delivered that morning, which was completely impossible given the taste and smell The food took over an hour to get here, so it was already pretty late when I got it. After about 20 minutes of arguing with a very rude woman on the phone, they finally agreed to give me a refund on the condition that I bring the food back. I told them that I live 20 blocks away and was not coming there at 9PM to bring back the food They said they would send a delivery guy back to pick it up. I waited 2+ hours for them and they never showed and never gave me my refund. My friend was so hungry that she ate her roll and ended up with really bad food poisoning.",1.0
"Wow. This place is horrendous. First of all I ordered the chicken katsu and when it was delivered it was undercooked! I contacted grubhub asking for a refund, and the restaurant called me saying the chicken wasn't undercooked and I didn't specify I wanted it ""well done""?? What the heck, chicken only comes in one type, cooked! Are you kidding me?

They refused to give me my refund and only gave me the option of them sending a new meal. Obviously I'm not going to trust them with chicken again so I asked for the pork katsu. Well I ate half of it and became what I thought was just really full, but realized later was FOOD POISONING because my stomach still ached for the entire night and I could not sleep. Finally at 4am I got out of bed and went to the bathroom and vomited my guts out! I tried falling asleep after but still couldn't, and 2 hours later threw up again and even pulled my neck muscle and was unable to look up without tremendous pain. 

Finally I was able to sleep for a little bit, and woke up at 12 and decided to contact grubhub asking for the refund I originally wanted, sure the restaurant would give it to me since their food made me incredibly sick. Well somehow I was completely wrong and the restaurant contacted me again refusing to give me my money back. And by the way, I spent $23 on this meal, and I only wanted the $6.95 that the pork katsu cost, I doubt giving someone seven dollars will put them out of business!!! They had the gall to offer me a free order of the same meal  the ""next time I ordered"". Why would I EVER order from this place again, let alone order the same dish that gave me food poisoning!!!! 

I have never received such terrible customer service in my life. I wish so much I could give them 0 stars. Don't eat here PLEASE.",1.0

"I hate to give 1 star but as someone who lives in the neighborhood I'm not going to overlook issues just because Tonalli's is considered the gem of Hamilton Heights. The atmosphere and the bartenders/waitresses/waiters are great. But the food on the other hand is quite debatable. A friend and I had decided to go to brunch and didn't want to go all the way down town, so we decided to just stay up here and I suggested Tonalli's ...bad idea. At first I had decided to just drink while she ate and we placed our orders. about 10 min later I did what no one should ever do and looked over at the table next to myselfs plate and decided that I wanted the eggs benedict w/ bacon and  flagged down the waitress (who was very sweet). NOT 5 MIN later my eggs benedict came out and my friends food hadn't. Mind you the couple sitting next to thought it was quick as well, assuming theirs hadn't come out that quickly. I waited for my friends food to come out before eating my own and at some point the wait was so long she and both started eating my homefries. lonnnnng story short... about 1-2 hours later I was throwing up UNCONTROLLABLY... onlything eaten that day was the eggs benedict(that came out in record time).

Went in the next day to speak to a manager and he told me food poisoning takes 24hrs.. (like hes a doctor)..and that I was getting high quality food at a VERY reasonable price.. pretty much.. told me kick rocks with Jesus sandals. And affirmed to me that I didn't get sick from his restaurant. Not only was he passive agressive but didn't seem to care that someone believed they got sick from their restaurant.  

it sucks because I live a block away and more than likely never go there again and I will never suggest it. O well.",1.0
i am so disgusted with this filthy sushi spot.  I went there to eat with my girlfriend and kid. We started with using the bathroom. No soap paper towels. The toilets did not flush nor less have saturated urine all over the bowl.  I wont forget the flying insects that were in there.  I immediately asked the manager to address the bathroom issue. They did by letting all those insects fly out of the bathroom and into the dining area.  I was waiting for some service and or hospitality when we were totally ignored.  By the time the check was begged for to get out of there I realized the flying insects were all around my table.  The least they could do is keep a clean spot.  This place used to be good. I do not know what happened here.  In conclusion when I got home thw bowel movements and throwing up w ith hwadache did not stop for a day… my friend caught food poison ing herw. And I did not believe it till now.  I did pay the bill. I left no tip for the experience there. Nor less the service. But as I left I was aked why there was no tip..i recommend if u dooooo want to get sick and do want food poisoning please enjoy. Otherwise this plqce should be closed down from the department of health….stay far away.,1.0
"It's a shame I have to write this review since I do really like this place.

"Decent beer, of which there's plenty in the city. But: over-priced food and terrible customer service. Rudest and least competent manager I've ever seen in action. We were a large table with a bill for $200, and were charged $8 for mustard and mayonnaise; when we asked about it, they looked offended and responded rudely from the get go. I would not recommend this place except for a quick happy hour drink, and even then - plenty of friendlier places to spend your time and take your business. 

And finally, someone at my table threw up for hours after eating...a veggie burger?!? What can you even do to a veggie burger to cause food poisoning? Sketchy at best.",1.0

I got a flyer advertising a new sushi joint so I figured I'd give it a shot. Big mistake.

"Tartina is a beautiful little boutique. The place has a surprisingly charming look, which is refreshing in the neighborhood that it's situated in. Looks like it belongs in the West Village. The place is very clean as well. The waiters seem like really nice folks. 

If anyone was rooting for this place, it was me. I live right around the corner and want to see more restaurants in the neighborhood with this kind of charm. Unfortunately, the experience is regrettable. The experience is not worth the charm of the physical space itself. 

So what's wrong with the experience? There were multiple things that went wrong in my last visit, and that's what led me to write this review. 

First, and foremost, the food is sub par. Many reviews recently have stated this. We had brunch this Saturday morning. There is free prosecco, mimosa, or bellini. I had the bellini, and it was pretty bad. I'm not sure how you mess up a bellini, but it seemed more like thick syrup, than a sparkling wine mix. 

Then I had the eggs benedict with a coffee. The portions seemed smaller than most places, or I was particularly hungry. The eggs benedict was fine, but bland. Places like Jane have much better eggs benedict. My friend had the frittata, and said it was fine. There was a dry salad on top of the frittata. And the frittata seemed like it was dry and bland as well. Presentation was very novice. 

Finally, I ordered pancakes. The pancakes came out uncooked inside, so there was raw pancake mix inside. It was covered in whip cream and bananas, so I started eating it. I started realizing that I was eating raw pancake mix when it stuck to the top of my mouth and to my teeth. This was disgusting and I sent it back. A bit later, I felt sick from it and vomited in the restaurant. 

The worst part of my experience was when I told the manager/head server about the raw pancakes. The restaurant was not concerned about the health of their customer. They did not ask about how I feel after eating raw pancake mix. They simply told me that I had to pay at least 1/2 of the amount of the pancakes. They said they were sorry that they *had* to charge me for $3.50 for the pancakes. I paid my bill and left feeling sick in my stomach, after vomiting in the restaurant. 

I was appalled by the manager/head server's response. It was terrible that they were so concerned about their profit and not the well being of their customer.

It is not worth having a meal here when there are so many great restaurants in NYC.",1.0
"I had the salmon, and the crab cakes w/ an order of fries. The only thing that was half decent was the fries, and if they messed that up then the place should just be shut down, but they were decent. The crab cakes weren't as crispy as they should have been on the outside, and the taste was a little bland, like they were missing something. The salmon was meh, nothing to rave about. This place gets only two stars because the next day I was terribly sick with a stomach bug, the food was definitely not satisfying, and the service was bad. I will not be returning.",1.0
"I ordered the pad thai which is normally a delicious dish, but sadly I woke up the next morning with a raging bout of food poisoning. I'm talking 10 life changing trips to the bathroom and hours of trying to hold down bland saltines and gatorade while confined in my bed. So, unless you want a really good excuse to get out of some meeting or date in the next two days ahead, I strongly encourage you: DO NOT order take out from here.",1.0

"so I went here for New Year's Eve with a group of 8 and had a fantastic time. The downstairs is spacious and welcoming, and the food was great (the tasting appetizer and arroz Chaufa were great). I came away thinking it would be a great place to bring my parents when they visit. 
I decided to revisit last night with a few family members and my bf (who chose pio pio for NYE) and the experience was so disappointing. The music was blasting club music in the dining room. The restaurant was probably at 80% capacity but the service was incredibly slow and confused - they forgot to bring the appetizer platter (no apology for this) and took ages to take our drinks orders and would run off before everyone had ordered. Seemed disorganized and amateur. 
We were all happy with our food - until I spent all last night suffering from horrific food poisoning. Never getting seafood (or anything else) there ever again.",1.0
"I made an account just because my experience at this restaurant was that awful. My wife and I went out late last night to Ammos  because we wanted to get something quick to eat near Grand Central.

What was unacceptable was waking up six hours later vomiting up the spanakopita. I've felt sick the entire day, and the website is not very helpful when it comes to registering complaints. I will never return to this ""michelin star restaurant.""",1.0
"The Islands is amazing! Food and service are off the charts. Before I describe those further, let me just say my only complaint here is that I'm pretty sure I got some sort of food poisoning because the chicken didn't taste super fresh (although it was still tender and juicy). The jerk sauce more than covered the majority of the lack of freshness. I had diarrhea the next day (and I never do with spicy food), but whatever it was well worth it!

The food here is absolutely delicious - incredibly flavorful and amazingly well cooked. The chicken is moist, fall-off-the-bone, and tender, and the jerk sauce is generously spiced and aromatic, the rice & beans are hearty and yummy, and even the cabbage here is extremely well cooked - not overly done so that it's mushy, maintaining the perfect balance of crispy / soft texture. It's a hole in the wall decor which is actually pretty cool, and it's quite funny that you can tell they could care less about how the place looked as long as you enjoy the food.

Other than that the service here is exceptional. It's a bit slow because the people serving you the food are also the people cooking it, but that's actually what makes the service even more informational. They ran out of jerk chicken when I got here which was disappointing because that's what I came for, but they said I could get stew chicken with a boat of load of jerk sauce. It was absolutely amazing - they should sell that jerk sauce. I would put it on everything I eat from now on. Smothering that jerk sauce over the rice & beans and the cabbage was the bomb!",1.0
"This was our second visit and boy has this place gone DOWNHILL.  Read this carefully if you are thinking about eating here. 

I had oysters and got seriously sick about 4 hours later.  In the bathroom for hours.  Ugh.  I'll be filing a report with the NYC health dept.  I'm sure the oysters made me sick.  I should have known better as i saw several employees touching the oysters and not washing their hands.  I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now I am paying the price.  Why is a rustic Italian now have a raw bar?  I shoulda known better.

Beyond food poisoning the service was terrible.  We were basically ignored, and couldn't get water refilled or other basics. 

The bathroom was dirty.

Honestly, I don't understand why people keep eating here.  I think the other eight people who were in the place  just don't use Yelp.",1.0
"I am writing this review aching in pain from food poisoning that I can only believe is due to eating at this restaurant. Like many I was lured to this place because of restaurant week. First of all let me say that the staff is did a good job in seating and responding when they were needed. Otherwise everything else was horrible. For starters, I ordered a cocktail that the waiter forgot. The first dish I had was a cold soup that was tasted like stale green peas blended into a paste and served. The second dish was a steak ordered medium rare but it was served blue rare that tasted like something that was in the fridge a little too long.

"For some reason, Yelp has decided to hide my earlier review of this restaurant, so here it is below. 

I ordered delivery service. My food arrived late, not properly sealed and cold. When I called the store to complain, all I got was a smart mouthed and rude manager who couldn't be bothered to listen to anything I had to say. Against my better judgement I ate the food that was delivered, only to wake up the next morning with food poisoning. 

So I would suggest you save yourself the trouble and order from the many other and better Indian restaurants in the neighborhood.",1.0
"Hadn't been to a diner in two years. Thought this New Year's I'd break the streak. This diner was the wrong choice. 

I ordered two eggs scrambled dry, bacon and toast. They added very greasy hash browns mixed with onions and peppers. The coffee was burnt, hash browns very greasy, bacon half cooked, eggs more of a runny omelet. 

10 minutes after eating my meal I had severe stomach cramps and was shivering. Needless to say it was food poisoning. My stomach is still cramping. Smh. Last time I eat at this diner or any other diner. 

Diners really need to be stringent with their kitchen cleanliness, food preparation and storing of perishable foods. You can't just assume since you've been established for years that you can slack off. No patron should feel sick before they even pay the bill, which by the way was $30.00 for two people.",1.0

So I sat there on the train at 10am, also the time 5000 other people were probably calling to get a table a month from today, for half an hour trying to get connected to a ""reservationist."" I finally hung up, called their confirmation line, left a message, and they called back.

They didn't charge me the $175 cancellation fee for changing the reservation back down to 2 people, which was nice of them, but the thought occurred to me, ""Even for a special occasion, why go to a restaurant that is so expensive and in demand and punitive that there would even be a risk of being charged $175 for nothing? Why sit on the phone and get stressed over this for basically an hour before handing over about half a month's rent for a lunch for 2?""

The food was fine. The sauces were outstanding. The portions were small. The first bites and the desserts were the highlights. The pork belly had too much gelatinous fat and I wouldn't have paid a $50 supplement again for the wagyu tartare. The consomme with the scallop was (obviously?) cold and tasteless. The waiters were countless and lovely. Even though the service is included, I rounded up $18 to the nearest $20 and still felt cheap.

There was a guy sitting behind us bragging loudly about the new buildings he was building in midtown and the view of the Statue of Liberty from his penthouse apartment, proclaiming that ""real estate keeps this city going"" and lamenting class warfare.",1.0
"I wanted to add, the next day I became violently ill. High fever, severe gastrointestinal distress body aches. I have already had a flu shot so it wasn't flu. The onset was also too sudden and the only thing different In my routine was eating their food. It went away after 48 hrs, which points to food poisoning. I did speak to the manager and he apologized but it never should of happened in the first place. I'm a fit person and if an older or younger person was running the fevers I had; they would of been hospitalized. No joke. I'm a registered nurse and I almost went to the hospital myself.",1.0

"kambi is okay, i just wish they didn't give me food poisoning. when i called to inform them that they had and if i could have a refund, they said they needed to see proof from a doctor that food poisoning was directly from them. i have two problems with this: 1) test results can't directly be like, oh your food poisoning was caused by ramen, i just know all i ate that day was kambi and my conclusion was the same as the doctor's, 2) they have awful customer service. they proceeded to explain to me that they ""get these kinds of calls all the time"" which is a huge concern. why would you open a restaurant and proceed to give all these people food poisoning??

Body aches like i was beat with a bat!  One day i was passing by and noticed one of the servers throwing bags of chicken on the floor and mixing the salad with no gloves!  These guys are filthy!

I also went to NYC.gov and reported it as a case of food poisoning. I want everyone to know, so - eater beware!",1.0
"We were very excited to try Marea.  We are native New Yorkers, not tourists like many of the diners on this Friday night.  The food tasted excellent.  One BIG problem:  my wife became violently ill about 3 hours after the meal, with what was almost certainly food poisoning.

I telephoned the restaurant the following day and informed the manager, who was defensive and only moderately sympathetic.  A true disappointment.",1.0

Let me assure you that you do not want food poisoning. Throughout the following day I was completely nauseous, I could not sleep, I could not I eat, and I was extremely dizzy during the entire day. I suspect the meats used in the tacos themselves were not refrigerated properly or came into contact with contaminated surfaces during food preparation or they were not cooked sufficiently.

"I was really looking forward to dining at this fabled establishment. The atmosphere is lovely, though the space is acoustically not conducive to conversation (we sat in the back enclosed garden area). The appetizers were fabulous; we had the tasting platter and grilled sardines (special of that day).  My main was the lamb cous cous, which was decent. The lamb was tasty and tender. It differed from the cous cous dishes I've had in the Arab districts across France.  The cous cous here was served a little dry and was not as flavorful, with no gravy on the side as is typically done at authentic, ""mom and pop"" Moroccan/North African restaurants.  Still, the meal was enjoyable. However, I endured a nasty bout of food poisoning immediately upon returning home.  Out went all of my dinner.  I only had a light lunch of crackers and some vegetables much earlier on in the day, so can only chalk it up to my meal at Mogador.  Thus, an average dining experience turned terribly nasty very quickly.  Such a disappointment, to say the least.",1.0

Had the chicken curry dish on recommendation from waitress.  Very small portion..but that wasn't the problem.  I had a severe case of food poisoning the next day...certain it was from this meal!!  I still get goosebumps!  I've noticed they now have a B grade on the window..makes sense.",1.0
"If you want a thick, juicy, and oversized burger that is overcooked and will make you get food poisoning, then this is the place for you!

And the delivery guy was rude, trying to hang up on me and doesn't even know what apartment I am in. Horrible restaurant, the owners tried to speak slang to me because I'm a young Hispanic man and frankly it was offensive.

"The main reason I look forward to my Sunday's is too have brunch, but this was a not so pleasant experience. The location is really nice (they have outdoor seating in front) but its a shame that the service was not up too par. My bf and I ordered some french toast to start and it was so raw and gooey, it actually looked disgusting too say the least. Shortly after that, we received our entrees, I ordered the eggs Benedict and my bf got the nemrod spatzle. However, I ended up receiving the wrong order. After receiving the right order 5 minutes later I still wasn't too pleased with how the eggs Benedict tasted. We also ordered some mimosas which were ok, I've definitely had better. I ended up feeling terrible all night long and found out I had food poisoning this morning. I wanted to like this place for Sunday brunch since we decided to try out a new restaurant but it was just horrible.",1.0

"I would've given this place a 4 star because the food was yummy. BUT, my husband got food poisoning from eating here last night!!! We had the Groupon so we ordered Belini with salmon caviar, Russian dumplings, short rib, and veal stew. Not sure what has caused the food poisoning, but if I had to take a wild guess, it'd be between the salmon caviar and the short rib (of which my husband ate significantly more than I did). Minus 2 stars. 

On top of that, maybe because we used Groupon to come here, service was really bad and slow. After our first two vodka shots, we wanted more. Somebody took away our empty glasses, but lacked the common sense to ask if we needed more. We asked for the drink menu, and that one person who seemed to be dedicated to take orders on his iPad was too busy adjusting lighting or music volume to stop by and ask do u guys want more. Oh well, if you don't want us to spend more money, that's fine. 

Oh and they included 18% tip in the bill. Maybe the people there knew their tips were included, hence there's absolutely no incentive to provide services? 

Another note, it felt really clubby at the restaurant. The light was dim, the music was clubby and loud, the people at the bar were drunk and obnoxious. Definitely NOT ""fine dining"" experience.",1.0

When you use the word ""challah"" on a menu it suggests thick, fluffy bread. The French toast bread was no more than 1 centimeter thick. The egg batter created a hard, dry egg crust around the edges of the bread. The fresh fruit was bruised and wilted, and the maple syrup must've been sitting out for awhile because it had the consistency of hot glue-gun glue. I ate 3 bites then left.

"This place has only nice view. Nothing else. Went out last Saturday w/bunch of friends and were very disappointed.  What went wrong:
1. Slow service - be prepared to wait for your food at least an 1.5 hr
2. Food is terrible. Steak was tasteless and was served cold. Side of brocolli so overdone I had mistaken it for kale. One of my friends got food poisoning from branzini (fish).
3. Loud club music boom boom boom in your ear. So inappropriate.  We had repeatedly asked waiter to lower music and request was ignored. We had to yell across the table to communicate. 
4. Waiter couldn't even crack a smile and was annoyed when asked for something. 
5. This is the best: we paid cash upon leaving and one of my gf paid for her share by credit card.  On following Monday she discovered that she was billed for the whole bill for thecwhole group plus her share. Meaning that they took cash and double charged us after. Wtf????  She signed and authorized receipt only for her share. She is trying to resolve this mess w/manager and hopefully will get her $$ back - but who needs this hemorrhoid?

So we wait about 10 mins and then we're told we are being seated in the front instead of the main dining room. At a table that was always ready to begin with. So we asked the manager why can't we sit in the dining room if we made reservations. His response was that this was part of the restaurant too and if we wanted to sit in the back it would be a 20 min wait. So upon closer inspection my father noticed an open table and asked why we can't sit there. The managers response: Oh that table just opened. So after telling him we will sit there we get into the back dining room and see there are 3 tables that can accommodate our party that are already set. Meanwhile nobody has left.

"I really, really WANT to love Cebu. I have had fun experiences there with friends, colleagues and family. However, on more than one occasion either myself or someone I was with has gotten sick after eating at Cebu.

 One night we took a family friend here for dinner and my fiance had to rush home right after because he had stomach issues. Another time I got really sick from eating pasta and drinking wine. Last night I ended up getting sick after eating a few pieces of calamari and 2 vegetable spring rolls. I am quite certain that many, if not all food items, are not made fresh. It is a tiny step up from chain restaurant food. 

 I love wine and I am a bit of a wine nerd. The wine at Cebu is of poor quality. Any wine that I have tried is extremely acidic and makes my stomach sour and my head ache almost instantaneously. 

 On the plus side, the waiters at our work parties have always been attentive, professional, and nice.

"I came here with a friend. From street view, this was the largest restaurant on the street, with plenty of dark spaces inside for privacy and a quieter atmosphere to catch up on. Of course, as the evening progressed, the restaurant filled up. 

Here are my complaints in a nutshell:

It seems as though there isn't enough wait staff. Yes, it got crowded, but we waited ten minutes just to get carry out boxes, and ended up walking to the cashier just to hand in our bill.

The price was not worth the dishes. There was so much food on the plate, but the presentation was awful, the food tasted home-made, the plates were 'as hot as lava' as the waitress explained (I've never been to a restaurant where I had to be pay special attention to NOT touch the plate). When I say the presentation was awful, the big chicken burrito I ordered had its contents spilled out all over the plate. The rice, cheese, beans, etc. were not in the burrito bread itself. The food tasted very very amateurishly made, I could have made the same meal myself at home. I ate 7 or 8 bites and felt a bit sickened. It felt a bit heavy on my stomach and for some reason, I did feel nauseous.

I asked for a carry out box thinking maybe it would taste better at home. Nope, ate five bites at home, and threw the dish out.

Do not come here.",1.0

Lasagna was meat only. No cheese. Bread was average. Ravioli did not have a full stuffing of ""guts"", was like eating buttered noodles. Nice place but I feel you could get better food in little Italy.

Update: I'm changing this from 3 stars to 1 because after I ate dinner here I awoke in the middle of the night with what possibly
Could be food poisoning. Headache, cramps, bloating and throwing up. And yes it was the ravioli that showed up during the reversal.",1.0

I am not sure if it was cross contamination, which I don't necessarily suspect because it looks like they have their act together in the kitchen. My suspicion is that it was related to the wild mushroom soup that was the specialty that evening.  Maybe a bad mushroom snuck in? Whatever it was, it was absolutely food poising and not just a natural reaction to some allergenic food source.

"The Good-
Food is good and its close to our apartment.

THE NOT SO GOOD-
The fact that the idiot people at the front always ask ""do you have a reservation..."" ""NO"" okay let me seat your or there is a wait yet they still seat us.. ??

Anyhow, the waitress who i've infamously name ""PONY BITCH"" is the worst.
If you go here you will know who I'm talking about. the one waitress who always seems to be around, to be annoying ( who always wears a high pony tail with 2 strands of hair coming from the front a la 1991) anyhow she sucks, and she like to yell at the other workers around her in front of the patrons of the restaurant... this is so rude and it bothers me so much every time. 
We asked for a red wine and brought us a glass of red with cork in it, we asked her if we could have another without cork in it and she told us that was what we got for ordering italian wines, since the ""portland wines were screw top... ???

"BEWARE: Many of Maison Harlem dishes include truffle oil. Truffle oil may sound fancy but it's nothing more than olive oil with added chemicals to give the aroma of truffles without the added cost of actually adding truffles. Unfortunately, for some, the added chemicals cause an irritable, unpleasant reaction. Plus, what's appetizing about having added chemicals in your meal?

My first meal from Maison Harlem was Seafood Pasta with a side order of the Truffle Mac and Cheese, which was very tasty, delicious and satisfying (I thought). This was not my first time having a meal with truffle oil, but was my first experience reacting to the oil in an unpleasant way. My initial thought was that I had food poisoning and after numerous failed attempts at reaching Jean, the owner/manager of the restaurant over the course of weeks to get some answers to my experience, Jean offered a partial credit. 

After the Seafood Pasta, Truffle Mac and Cheese, I didn't realize that the truffle oil was the cause of my experience. Several weeks after the ordeal, I tried the Mild Mushroom Risotto with truffle oil and had a similar but milder reaction. So I did some research online and figured out that the truffle oil was the culprit.

I would be very careful ordering any of their dishes that include truffle oil. Listen to your body if the aroma turns your stomach a little bit, because, otherwise, you'll pay for it later with frequent visits to the lavatory  ... and will get little - if any - sympathy from the restaurant whose food caused you the grief.",1.0

Soul Fixins is super close to where I live so I ordered take out online (which was a nice, simple process) and picked up my food in store in less than ten minutes. The service was great, the environment was great, here comes the kicker: I got food poisoning after eating this meal. Now I really wish I could pinpoint exactly how I got it. Was it the collard greens? Were they not washed well enough? Was it the chicken? It seemed to be cooked all the way...or hm, maybe it was the cornbread that was a bit mushy (which I'm not stupid I stopped eating it after the first bite) I mean how careless can you be as a business? You didn't even cook the cornbread long enough? Was their some type of cross contamination going on in the kitchen? I'm truly disappointed. Seemed like such a great place but I'm never going back.

"I think it's funny that you can rate a McDonalds on yelp but here I go. First, before I begin, what did you all expect? Why expect so much from a 24 hour McDonald's?

To be honest, I'm ashamed to say I've come here like at least a dozen times because it's convenient. Mostly because it's the worst McDonald's I've ever been to in my life. It's insane how bad each experience is but yet I still give in when I crave those fries. Fries like crack.

The staff is laughably bad at giving off any sense of professionalism, they're almost all stoned teenagers who randomly shout during their constant conversations. The food usually looks like a 2 year old boy threw it together, the fries cold 75% of the time. I've gotten sick like 3 different times after eating here, there was a hair in my sandwich once, and the coffee is pure diarrhea in a cup. 

I worked at a fast food restaurant for my first job, and I can understand why this all goes on. There's no reason to expect anything really when you pay so little is how 99% of the staff is at McDonalds. Except for the ok ones in Manhattan. But even those suck still. I still don't understand the point of reviewing them... 1 or 2 stars max, no one gives a shit. People still go and always will, they knew what they were getting into when they chose to eat here.

I was so happy to discover a decent sushi place in the area as most of you know, FiDi area lacks in good sushi. However, this place gave me major food poisoning three days in a row! Something fishy about their fish! 

The first time I got take out: sashimi plate (the $9.50 one), Alaska roll, and seaweed salad. All was tasty, especially the sashimi - which also came with huge thick melt in your mouth pieces. But I knew the price was too good to be true. $9.50 for 12 pieces of sashimi!? Low and behold, I ended up on the toilet for an hour the following morning. I originally had thought it was from the Chipotle I had earlier in the day, so I didn't think twice about it being the sushi until I ordered a few more things the next day via Seamless ($15 off woohoo) and again ordered the sashimi (really bad choice, I know) and salmon avocado salad. I ate the sashimi that day and saved the salad for the following day. So, now I've been having stomach flu for the past three days.

On the bright side the food was great (as it should) and beautiful presentation.

The service was polite and professional but just what you can expect from this kind of places, so if there's such a thing, I would say the service was ""average 3 Michelin star"".

I know this is not the restaurant's problem but the crowd was a little snobbish imho. I guess the location and the fact that you must wear a jacket makes people more arrogant. 

The price wasn't as bad as other places so that's certainly a plus :)

I was hungry at the time but the beef was absolutely inedible and when I mean inedible I mean the meat was the same as rubber to the point where I couldn't finish chewing it so I threw it away. 

On top of the bad beef, the tortilla was bland and dry and a really big mess. I did order take-out but still it would have been nice to have it put together better than just slabs of beef, rice, salsa, salad and tortillas all throw into 1 container that was completely messy to even attempt to eat. 

This wasn't my first time there so I've had their chicken burrito once, which wasn't that bad and probably deserves like a 2 but because I got sick for over a week I'm giving it a 1 star.

The other reason this place is justified a 1 star is the fact that there's better places closer. I don't know how this place is any better in quality than Chipotle except the portion size is larger. There's also like 5 other Mexican places nearby so I would just say try the other ones, this place is nothing special and there's just 1 guy on the grill and it's a bit dirty.",1.0

The food poisoning I got was the WURST I had in many years. I started feeling heartburn in the evening (didn't eat anything after the Falafel so it must have been it). The food started going up my throat. I then started throwing up, which continued every hour until 6am the following morning. Until my stomach was empty and clean. This was so bad, I had throat ache for 4-5 days after, due to the strong vomiting.
I would NEVER eat at this cart again. I will probably avoid any Falafel cart (unless operated by Israelis). And I definitely would advise you to stay away from Alan's. I am not the only one to complain of food poisoning from his cart. There are other yelp reviews of same problem. Stay away.",1.0
"I had an upsetting experience here a week ago and have been debating writing a review ever since. My boyfriend and I have gone here regularly (almost once a week for dinner) for the past two and a half years. We enjoyed our meals and conversations with the staff. Because of that, I wanted to write off our most recent meal there, and maybe not go back, but also not say anything. However, my boyfriend got sick from his meal, and seeing that reviewer Christine G. posted on 9/29/13 about a similar experience, I figured it was time to share. 

As I mentioned, we usually go for dinner. We have tried a number of the dishes (rolls, udon, tempura, really most of the menu), but one of us almost always ends up ordering the chirashi. Last week, we went for lunch and both ordered the chirashi lunch special, which we had also had before. Our soups and salads were fine. Then the chirashi came out. It was definitely not fine. Some of the fish was okay - the tuna, however, was brown, wrinkled and tough, and the tamago (sweet egg) was also brown. It was obviously not only not fresh, but old enough that it should not have been served. We left those pieces on our plates and when our waitress cleared the table, she asked why we didn't eat them. My boyfriend paused for a moment and then told her it was because they were clearly old. She told us that she was going to tell the chef and manager but did not apologize or say anything else. We gave her our card to pay, and shortly after signing for the first check, they brought back a second because they had left a drink off of the initial bill. We paid for that too, all without complaint, and when our card was run for the second bill, the manager (instead of the waitress) brought it back and basically dropped it on the table without saying a word or looking at us. To compare - on our way in, he shook my boyfriend's hand, patted him on the back and walked us to a table. During previous visits, we have had 20 minute long conversations with multiple staff members, many of whom made it a point to stop by our table whenever we visited, even if we weren't seated in their area. On our walk out of the restaurant, after setting aside the old items on our plates and not causing a scene, complaining loudly, asking for a refund, or anything, some of the same employees gave us dirty looks or ignored us.

For that that amount of rudeness, maybe we should have made a huge stink about it. To top it off, my boyfriend spent the entire night sick to his stomach. We will absolutely not be back.",1.0
"i'm sorry this place closed down, but hopefully will not open again until it is 100% clean..
without any knowledge of them being dirty, i came here 2 days before they closed down for the first time ever and possibly the luckiest day of my life that i got food poisoned right after my $5.25 dinner box (which i thought it's the best deal everrrr!!!!). 3 days straight i was in awfully pain and even till now about a week later, I still cannot eat much as my stomach's still weak..I'm a very healthy person, exercise daily, rarely gets sick...and especially with a strong stomach. (never had a problem like this before)
please people, clean it up before you serve the food to public. make sure everything's cooked right...i'm a young healthy strong adult and your food almost killed me.

"UPDATE: I got food poisoning from this place. Only go here if you want to get sick and have the bubble guts. 

This place is horrible. I got the Pig's Head Cuban and it was the biggest disappointment. The description on the menu said it would have a Pig Head's terrine; there was no terrine to be found. Maybe they can fool the simpleton hipsters who frequent here by throwing around culinary terms that they themselves don't understand, but NOT this foodie. The sandwich itself was very flavorless and left much to be desired. This was the worst ham sandwich I've ever had. To even call it a Cubano would be as disrespectful as the angry Puerto Rican who made the subpar sandwich. If you are a foodie or appreciate good flavorful food, stay away from this wannabe place.",1.0
"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. This is the meal that stole christmas. I came here yesterday, the eve of Christmas eve, with my boyfriend before going to see a holiday movie. I ordered the mushroom hummus. By the time we got our tickets and we're waiting in line, my stomach started to feel bad. Two scenes after opening credits, I was in the bathroom downstairs and then in a cab uptown, getting violently sick the whole time. I didn't know hummus could give you food poisoning, but this food certainly did. Now I'm up on Christmas eve after a night of getting sick and I still don't feel great. Needless to say, I will never be going back there. My advice to everyone is to stay far away.",1.0
"OK, I'm a foolish individual.  I wrote a lousy review about New Food King and I did not take my own advice.  I order from them because they are on GrubHub and it was easy.  Well they gave me a case of food poisoning the other day.  I went to lunch with some friends the day before and ate like a pig.  I was still in the mood for some piggish behavior and ordered from New Food King.  I ordered Pork Chow Fun, Chicken Fried Rice and a couple of other things.  I devoured the Chow Fun.  It tasted great.  Before the day was complete I was as sick as a dog.  I was vomiting and had diarrhea.  I also had a lot of pain.  I WILL NEVER go back to these people again.  Their no mustard, no plates and tasteless soup should have been my clue but I got lazy.  I certainly paid for my laziness.",1.0

"Valentine's Day 2015. The restaurant just opened up this day after having been closed for renovations. My fiance and I were so hungry after running a few errands. It was 4 pm and this would be our first meal of the day. We sat ourselves toward the back and noticed that there was a signed credit card receipt at a clean table. That should have clued me in to the fact that the wait staff were not on their game.

I ordered something from the menu - chicken fried steak with eggs over easy and chedder grits. My fiance has serious allergies so he told the server first about his allergies, then proceeded to order his burger, advising again - ""no tomatoes, no dairy - these can't even touch my food. And please, nothing extra - if I haven't listed it, don't add it"". 

So we waited for what seemed like forever. The two men that sat near us after we arrived, were waiting 15 minutes for their coffee and had to get it from another server. They left after 20 minutes later because their food hadn't arrived. Our food finally came out after 40 minutes.

My food was cold. The yolks had been fully cooked - not over easy. And the chedder grits had no chedder in them. I asked the server about it and he said he would bring a new batch of grits. My fiance took three bites of his burger before he realized that he was starting to feel ill. The raw garlic he had ordered was grilled onto the exterior of the rye bread, with BUTTER. I asked for a manager, who after speaking with us said he would come back. I ate some of my food despite it being cold.  And within moments my fiance's allergic reaction progressed, so we had to leave in a hurry. 

So our Valentine's day plans were cancelled due to sickness. And here I am, the next day dealing with a touch of sickly food poisoning.",1.0

Bad idea!!! I got food poisoning from the tuna onigiri. I'm pretty sure the food is fresh in the morning, but if you leave something out with such low refrigeration temperature, the food is bound to spoil!

You can go to a legit Japanese restaurant and order take-out for less. Everything here isn't worth the price.. 2 for $1.50 for tiny sushi pieces (that's actually a rip-off)

To top it all off, the girl at the cash register overcharged me (glad I caught this before the place closed for the day).

Verdict: never coming here again",1.0

"Had a reservation for 10 in the basement private banquet room on a Thursday night to celebrate my cousins graduation from Columbia Law School. We were the only party in there.  The location is right across from the 5th precinct NYPD station.  There is absolutely no parking or standing due to the police cars parked on the curb.  There are parking garages if you want to pay $40 for 3 hrs, or you can find muni meter parking on the street at $3.50/ hour which is what we did.

We had the wedding banquet style family set up.  Jelly fish and cold cuts, sliced steak and bok choy, fried tofu was the three pre soup apps, then the crab soup, very good.  Then came a squid thingy, the waiter couldn't really explain what it was in English and we didn't have anyone who knew the English word even though they knew what it was in Chinese.  Apparently it was stomach lining of a giant squid! It was slimy with a strange texture and a yucky after taste! That was the only thing I couldn't eat more than a bite.  They gave us warm wet wipes and changed sharing plates, good service, two waiters.  Shrimp with mayo, Chinese cabbage, fried rice, Peking duck, seafood dish with regular squid and scallops and a fish dish was the end.  We were full before the soup came!  About an hour later, I had diarrhea!  Not saying the place was dirty, just saying that squid thing didn't agree with me!  Given my belly ache and traffic and parking hassles, I dreaded the night so I can't give it any more than a triple star!  I wouldn't go back unless I lived in Chinatown.  Driving from Long Island into the city on a weeknight during rush hour with parking issues is enough to make anyone's blood boil, and then to rush home for the toilet is not my idea of a great evening!  Great to celebrate an auspicious family event, however we could have easily dined in Queens where parking isn't an issue!  Decent food, but this Long Islander won't be back here unless I had a free car service!",1.0

Long story short I have really bad food poisoning from being there. I thought it would be a nice place to go to from the amount of reviews. I had grilled calamari which tasted odd so after the 4th piece I told the lady to take it back. It was probably undercooked. I also had the lamb gyro and lemon roasted potato so I'm not sure what caused it but I was definitely the food there. I immediately got sick,1.0
"HORRIBLE DON'T EAT AT THE RED LOBSTER IN QUEENS BLVD!!!
Omg this Red Lobster is the worst place to eat at and it's sad. I've been going to Red Lobster for more than 25 years with my family and friends and was happy when they opened in Queens Blvd a few stores away from Sizzlers. I went yesterday with my husband to have some drinks and eat and was shocked with the change of the menu my favorite platter no longer available. Seems like they only have a few choices now anyways that's not what killed it for me. First we went in and asked for a table for two had to wait like 10mins (place was empty I should've waked out then) they gave us a table and no one came to us,for about 15mins to order our drinks and appetizer which took another 15-20 mins (I could understand if the place packed,but it was empty) We finally ordered our food and by the time we were done waiting waiting and waiting we got out check. We spent a whole lot of money (no red lobster doesn't have happy hour which sucks)  Skip this place your better off eating at Joes Crab Shack right next to the Jcpenny entrance they have Happy Hour everyday from 4-7 and then 9-closing. On Tuesdays they have $2 drinks all day and $2 appetizers all day!

"I am only a fan of the cooked food.  Everything else beware because the prepared cold tuna salad and now the egg salad gave me food poison.  I go to get an omelet 4 - 5 times a week and usually on the weekends don't make it in until around noon.  Today they were super slow and the rude overweight cook said this was the last time he would make it for me because it is to hard to clean the grill.  Seriously!

"Horror. Even Snooki would have been disappointed. Do not under any circumstances allow anyone to make you go to this place - regardless of the boozy promises of a blissful afternoon that you won't remember. I wish I didn't remember this place. My friend got sick from their under cooked food. The ambiance was stale, and smelled like they tried to cover up something rotten with too much bleach. And the drinks! HA!


Places like this establishment disgraces the name of 'brunch'. Brunch is a glorious, potentially life changing meal, filled with stunning breakfast food, omelettes... popovers.... Benedict... I could go on.... and DRINKS. A great brunch place will serve you a delicious cocktail, mimosa, and/or Bloody Mary that, after one solid drink, leaves you with a pleasant glow and light feeling. Only Mistakes like Pranna feel the need to trick you into thinking their snake oil orange juice has Champagne in it. FAIL.


The music was mildly entertaining as were the patrons. The most entertaining part? My friends pointing out that the jokers who paid for champagne bottle service with a magic sparkler for who knows how much, received a bottle of Andre. But I can't dog on them too hard... I was sadly jokered into this experience myself. Next time, I choose brunch.",1.0
"It took us an hour and a half to get our food during a pretty dead week night.  Apparently the kitchen was having issues (though there were only 5 parties of 2 in the whole restaurant -- inside and out), but there was no warning ahead of time to chill out with drinks and maybe order some chips.  If you're sitting outside you have to get up to hunt from the waitstaff while they're chilling inside.  At one point the waitress/bartender disappeared for 15 minutes to go to the corner deli, our drinks came 45 minutes after our order.  When the food finally came out, it was just bad -- it was cold and the tortillas were sopping wet.

"Accompanied by a family member for a doctor appointment afterwards my party of two ate lunch here as it was the nearest café since I am currently in abject pain from surgery.  By the power of observation it was nearly empty at peak lunch hour of 12 pm noon with only one White woman and one Chinese patron we doubt if the quality of food was any good.  The atmosphere was rather dark and dingy.  Neither of us wanted a big lunch but something quick so we can both be on our merry way home.  Ergo, respectively we ordered:

Roast duck with noodles $5.25
Roast Pork with noodles $5.25

Whoa!  It was heavily loaded with MSG and salt.  Completely unhealthy.  The MSG made us both thirsty for water.  Three hours later I ended up with a big case of diarrhea with the porcelain throne (aka toilet) for 1/2 hour with additional pain. Pain from surgery + diarrhea.  Service was average as they stood attention within mere inches away from us either waiting to usher us out or waiting to serve us more while listening in to our private conversation.  ICK to MSG!",1.0

I stopped into this restaurant to check it out and pick up a menu.  It seemed like a neighborhood establishment....certainly nothing fancy.  The hostess was friendly.

HOWEVER, after an hour or so my stomach started feeling achy.  And then...well, without putting out too much information, I had all the symptoms of food poisoning!

My friend, being a dumpling fanatic in general, ordered three different kinds of dumplings and the duck pancake. We dug in, and as she sank her teeth into the pancake she mentioned how it tasted a little ""off"". I decided to skip it, being that I don't really eat meat in general. We finished everything and went on our way. I wasn't mesmerized by the experience but I was impressed by how popular this joint was. At 7 p.m. it was already jam packed. I also liked the Bring Your Own Beer aspect (there needs to be more of that in NYC).

That night, my friend and I went to bed and at 2 a.m. she became violently ill.

1 saw the guy drop a shaved potato pick it up and throw it in the container he had.

Listen, I'm no foodborne illness expert, but that must have been left out for a LONG time to acquire that smell. Anyway, I told the waitress to smell it, she said she didn't smell anything which led my friend and I to believe she either had no sense of smell or did a great job of covering it up - no idea why. She said it was fresh, offered no accommodation or remorse.

"I unfortunately had a very bad experience here. The food was mediocre and my bf had food poisoning afterward (to be fair his stomach is little sensitive). Way too pricy for the food quality. The 1 star is for a previous meal I had on new year's day, it was the only place around Columbia that was open and that time the meal was actually alright.",1.0

"0 stars! Do not eat here unless you want food poisoning!! Had cooked sushi for lunch here on Monday (eel avocado roll and a nut roll) and I'm still reeling from the after effects. Got sick that night and had to call out of work 3 days this week... The last time I felt this sick, I had an amoeba in my digestive tract. Plus they're overpriced!! F this place, never again!",1.0
"This place is way over rated. Everything looks old. I ordered the ""special of the day "" corned beef figuring it was fresh. Horrible. The counter person asked me if i wanted it hot. Huh? I said if its the special of the day it should be hot no? With that he walked away,cut the meat,put it on a plate and MICROWAVED IT. DISGUSTING!!!! I said i dont want that and my friend said ill take it. I guess he was trying to be nice. Just got off the phone with him,hes so sick he ran out of toilet paper. That said i looked around at the display case. What kind of a butcher leaves old 1/2 inch thick steaks on display. I ordered hot wings which were not hot,had no taste,and were way overbreaded. Shepards pie was the worst i ever had. The salads(mac,potato,ect) were all old so i past on that. Gotta say the roast beef was the only good thing there. This place was horrible. Ill never come here again.",1.0
Went for my 30th birthday dinner. Was so excited as this restaurant has been on my list for years. Sadly I got food poisoning and spent a day in bed after our 2 hour dinner at the sushi bar.,1.0
"I shouldn't have ignored the warning signs for this B rated restaurant.  I glimpsed into the kitchen before I entered and saw a bucket filled with chickens just lying on the counter. Then when I was ordering, the waiter advised me to choose something else because my first choice ""wasn't fresh."" Red flag! But I was hungry and it was cold, so I thought I would be safe if I just ordered vegetarian.

The vomiting started a while later when I returned home.  It seems like I got food poisoning.  I vomited about six times, once every hour.  My husband felt extremely nauseated from the food as well. Our entire weekend was ruined because of Balduchi's Indian food.",1.0
"before i start, i almost feel bad for writing this review but i think that the public and the owners of this Establishment deserve to know of the going on in this restaurant. i came for a late dinner with my wife (it was our honeymoon) and we wanted a nice place to go after our Broadway play our waitress was really nice but really uninformed on the dishes when my wife had questions i think she was new. 
we ordered the pork belly it was grand and spot on the glaze was super flavorful.so after that i figured we would get a bottle of wine to celebrate together. For dinner i ordered the steak and fries and my wife order the bass and fingerling potato's 
my steak came out not even luke warm and was so chewy it tasted like dog food from my experience eating steak it usually melts in your mouth. i asked the server to recook the steak and she took it back they cooked it again it came out warmer but still a little cold. the main problem in opinion is the quality of the meat they order at this restaurant. Steak should never be that chewy unless your buying the cheapest cuts of meat possible. now onto my wife's bass, came out cold as well undercooked she eat none of it. i asked her what the matter was and she said that she felt really sick. when we got home she puked all night until about 4am it was just an awful experience. its not like this place is cheap either with these kind of prices you would think that they would at least serve good quality food. well that's my story of going out to Jacques on my honeymoon. in the end they did not charge us for our entrees but still we wasted our money on the 50 dollar bottle of wine and a waste of time when i could have gone to some were else.",1.0
"First off, the guy behind the pizza counter had his iPod in so when I ordered he spoke so low I couldn't hear him. I had to ask what he said several times and each time he was unintelligible. The guy sitting nearby on break finally spoke up to tell me what the other guy was saying. The pizza was huge but meh. The slices are so large and meh that I got tired of eating them and felt sick a few bites into each slice which had never happened before.The vodka sauce pizza was bland and greasy I had to blot it  and I saw other people doing the same to their pizza. The mushroom was ok at first but then disgusting. The original and the deep dish with tomato and basil were ok but nothing special. I'm going to have to blame the grease from the vodka sauce pizza on the horrible shits and gas we all had later. No thanks.",1.0
"I signed up for yelp just to write this review. I have passed his place a few times and since my usual shawarma place has been closed for a while I thought I would give it a try. I ordered a falafel sandwich and a lamb shwarma sandwich. I was halfway through the shawarma when I felt like I was going to be sick. A mad dash to the privvy led to  a half an hour of unpleasantness the likes of which I haven't seen in years. This place should be shut down. I got violently ill from the food and I want everyone to know it.
I gave this place one star because you can't give it no stars !!!!!",1.0
"This place is just awful, I feel bad for any tourist that comes to NYC expecting good New York pizza and gets this. Aside from the fact that the slices were super thin over cooked and had almost no flavor I felt sick for about six hours after. If I had to pick between the construction on second avenue being finished or this place closing down I would choose the latter. Maybe I'll be less grumpy when I don't feel like I'm going to throw up. Oh and it's getting two stars and not one because the employees were  nice and the service was good.",1.0
"I had the spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodles and spicy & tingly beef hand-ripped noodles. While the food here is authentic, but not worth getting sick for. I got lunch here twice this week and both times came down with food poisoning. The first time was just stomachache, so I didn't think anything of it. Second time, I threw up that night before dinner - the same feeling I get when I accidentally eat spoiled food, headache and nausea. I've eaten way more spicy food before, so I'm pretty sure it's not the spices. The restaurant workers also expressed frustration over inadequate AC, so I suspect the restaurant may have cut corners to save electricity. Please beware.",1.0

My friend and I ordered the papaya salad with crab, the fried chicken, and the pad kee mao. The fried chicken was a standout, and the noodles were well done. But... the crab was obviously not fresh, and it was unlike the version I had in Queens which came with large portions of crab. The crab here was spindly with no crab meat. Both my friend and I got sick immediately afterwards. I wouldn't hazard coming back here again.",1.0
"I originally came here because of the good yelp reviews. The bartenders were very nice and personable. My friend got sick after the food though, so now I'm hesitant to eat at Dark Horse. If you're looking to hang out for a drink though it's a great place to do so.",1.0

"Cool, quiet atmosphere for a Saturday night out... buuuuut I got food poisoning.

Our server seemed to have trouble with English, and as a result got 2 parts of my order wrong.

Couple of pros, though: thick tomato-y tomato sauce (definitely none of that Ragu crap) and al dente pasta. The food really did taste great, so I hope my stomach was upset for a different reason.",1.0
"I am almost positive I got food poisoning from this place. I had the falafel sandwich and a few hours later my stomach was in hell. 12 hours of severe stomach pain, cramps and nausea. There is a chance it wasn't from their food, but I won't be taking that chance again...",1.0
"Wish I could give less than 1 star. Third time here, I believe everyone deserves 2nd and 3rd chance, NOT a fourth, I will not return. Was there on a Sat morning, bagels were hard, I think they were leftover from fri! I had to toast it to make it edible, and I hate toasted bagels! The tuna fish tasted like it was left out on a counter, I got sick Sat night and am certain it was from the spoiled mayo in the tuna. My wife their cream cheese on their stale, toasted bagel and after 2 bites, threw it in the garbage. Do NOT eat here. I can't believe health department hasn't closed them down yet! Only a matter of time. Avoid if you value your digestive tract.",1.0
"I've been a regular at this place since I started working in the Financial District a few months ago.  I enjoyed the food (even at almost $15 per meal) and stopped in at least twice a week given the dearth of healthy food options in the area.  Sadly, I will never return to this location.  After ordering my usual last week (hot bowl with veggies, quinoa, red curry sauce and salmon), I began experiencing severe stomach pain and other classic, disgusting symptoms of food poisoning.  Because I really did enjoy their food, I chalked it up to a 24-hour stomach bug and returned  yesterday.  I ordered the same thing and once again began experiencing the same symptoms.  I hate to remove this place from my lunchtime rotation, but after these two truly awful incidents, I'm heading back to Dig Inn.",1.0
"We had dinner at Tao because of a wonderful past dining experience several years ago. After this most recent experience I will never return. I ordered sushi to start and it was warm, mushy and had a bad taste. Definitely not edible and had to be sent back. The potstickers were ok, the shrimp in my dinner were tough and over cooked. My date had the Chilean sea bass which was excellent.  A few hours after dinner I became very very sick and spent the entire night vomiting. I will never return to Tao, it's a beautiful restaurant but not worth risking food poisoning.",1.0

"I have gone to Sardis many, many times over the years when visiting NYC.  Unfortunately, I got the worst case of food poisoning that I have ever had last Friday night.  72 hours into it, and I am still not feeling too well.  I called to speak with the manager.  He could have cared less and offered a myriad of excuses, stating he had no evidence that I was ill.  I did not call expecting anything other than possibly an apology, but mainly I called so that they could contact their vendor to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  I went to Sardis this time so that my niece could experience it as it is kind of a fun thing to do before a show.  My elderly mother, my niece, and I all got the filet medallions.  They felt a little nausea but fortunately did not get the full blown food poisoning.  My steak was very, very rare, instead of medium, and it was my fault for not sending it back.  I wouldn't have bothered writing this review had it not been for the extreme rudeness and unsympathetic attitude of the manager, when all I was doing was trying to warn him so that no one else would get sick.  I guess no good deed goes unpunished.  I am afraid I will never return to Sardis.  As a side not, after speaking to our concierge at one of the finest hotels in NYC, he informed me that they never recommend Sardis.  Too bad because the atmosphere is kind of fun. Finally, I overheard one waiter chastising our waiter to push the cheesecake because they had too much left over from Thanksgiving.  I fell for that and it was obviously not fresh.",1.0

"Solid food and speedy service. However, the last times I ordered and ate fried rice, I felt kind of sick. It's hard to go wrong with General Tso's chicken at Nikko. The portions are pretty big. Never tried the hibachi but people look pretty entertained when they're having parties.",1.0
"Sushi buffet is always a rigged coin flip. You're always hoping for heads, but some evil sorcery is giving you more tails than you want. That being said, I don't ever seem to learn my lesson and opt for gorging myself on 20 pieces of raw fish. 

However, that doesn't impact my rating of Yuka. I like that the place has a certain mystery - you can't tell if the sushi chefs are really Japanese or Chinese immigrants pretending to be Japanese. Or vice versa. Or maybe some combination of both (I did hear one of the chefs speaking in Japanese to a client). However, given that I have over 10 years of experience with sushi buffets, I do believe there are better AYCE sushi establishments within the 5 boroughs. The fish and prices at Yuka are usually pretty good, but I absolutely hate that they only serve sushi and NOT sashimi. That's pretty much forcing 5 bowls of rice down your throat. I felt pretty sick at the end of the night but I also think that's because the fish wasn't that great this time around. The first time I went, it was good enough for me to go back again. This time, the scallops were very dry and salty, the rice on the sushi was overflowing to the point of insanity, the surf clams were dingy little pieces of ocean flesh, and the raw fish just wasn't that great ... plus, my boyfriend and I were so thirsty when we got home. 

I say try this place if you're in the area and pray to Poseidon that Yuka got a fresh batch. When it's good, it's pretty good.

And NEVER, for the love of whichever god you pray to, get the fermented soy beans. You have been warned.",1.0
"Below average chinese food. I'm done getting chinese food in fidi

The chicken and brocolli had a weird texture and sauce to it. It looked like the accompanying chicken fried rice had fake chicken or some sort of imitation meat - I felt sick after couple of bites

The general tso was ok but honestly it was just super deep fried so maybe that's why",1.0
"I went to Spice on 2/25/25015 and ordered a pineapple fried rice with shrimp. The meal was serve around 1:30 pm. Towards the end of the meal I had two pieces of shrimp left with a little bit of rice. I bit the shrimp by itself with no rice and felt it was soft and slimy. I looked at the piece and it was blue/ grey inside. I looked at the last piece of shrimp and it was more raw in the inside. I ate all the shrimp pieces with rice and couldn't detect the texture until I ate the last two. Since the meal was almost finished and I needed to get back to work I let it go. Around 2:15 when I was walking back to work, my mouth started getting itchy and swollen. I went to urgent care where at that point my lips were swollen, red, hot and I had formed hives around my lips. In addition, my mouth and tongue were itching and beginning to swell. I was immediately treated for anaphylaxis and sent to the emergency room. Of course I suffered an anaphalactic reaction related to shellfish. I cannot eat any shellfish raw but I am well with it well when it is throughly cooked because the enzymes that cause the reaction has been denatured. I called on 2/26/2015 to advise them of my experience.  I was put on hold various times and I was able to speak to Sam who indicated she is the manager. She told me to call back later because she was busy. I told her the matter is of great importance and she needs to address it now. She put me on hold and when she came back I started to explain what had occurred. At this point she screamed at me and said ""well I don't know when this happened"". The first thing I said was when the incident occurred and told her that. She started screaming again and said she can't help me because she was too busy so there is nothing she can do. I said she has the obligation to assist me because of the poor experience and the negligence of the cooking staff not cooking the shrimp well. Again she screamed at me and said she can't do anything. I told her she was unprofessional and rude and wanted the corporate office number or the contact number of the owner, which she did provide. She said call him and see if even would even pick up. She said this soo quickly I asked her to repeat it and she became rude when I asked to do this! I called Lenny the owner and left him a message. I'm appalled by the manager's behavior and surprised of the quality of food they served me. Please ensure your food is properly cooked and I hope no one else falls sick or suffers the unprofessional behavior exhibited by the manager.",1.0
"I was really excited about this from the first bite. I got the rice bowl with teriyaki steak and sol fried rice. The flavors went together really well but the dish was overall too heavy. I wish that I had been a little hungrier, because I felt sick by the end of the meal.

That being said, they do give a generous portion of meat and the product is worth the price. I may go back to try something different.",1.0
"Had several visits to Dallas BBQ since they opened but wouldn't consider it a regular spot. Last food delivery did the trick to not eat there again, Got massive food poisoning from a chili cheddar burger I had 3 days ago and am still sick. Noticed I'm not the only review stating this so apparently its poor inventory management or inexperienced kitchen staff.

To be fair - As far as past visits go, decor isn't cozy at all but not a deal breaker for me as I'm there to eat. Service is below average in most of my past visits / delivery orders....The food is average BBQ when it isn't making me sick. Simply not worth the risk.",1.0
"I ordered food from these people 1 hour ago and still no one has come to deliver it. I understand it's cold outside and all but at least have some courtesy and let me know that my order is running late. 

Now for the food, the chicken is very good and not like your average crown fried chicken. The chicken is obviously fried fresh in a different type of oil. The chicken is always golden color and very good. It's average food for delivery but they need to move faster.

Update- So the food was good but now I'm vomiting a lot. Ugh this is insane. This is the only thing I consumed so I'm thinking a bad case of food poisoning or maybe it just a didn't sit right at all. 

It didn't sit right",1.0

"My boyfriend and I went here on the recommendation of a box office agent at the theatre where we picked up our show tickets.  We had some high expectations based on this recommendation.
The restaurant itself is very neat, architecturally, though very poorly lite inside.
The staff wasn't the friendliest.  Mostly dead pan stares and a lackluster personality from the hostess.  Our waiter barely waited on us whatsoever. He disappeared for long periods of time.
The pizza itself... well...
We ordered a traditional with prosciutto, spinach and fresh garlic.  The spinach was really wet... likely from a can and not fresh. It didn't taste good either.  The prosciutto was just... NOT prosciutto.  It was thick sliced and tasted like regular old ham.  Underwhelmed is a good word for it.
On top of that, my boyfriend got sick after eating there too.

"I read interesting reviews about that place, and really wanted to try.
Managing restaurant in the city for quite a while i love to learn from other places, so it was a great idea, which ended up not so great after all.
1-Service
Slow, in at first, not so busy night. Waited to get water served.
Then we asked for two appetizers to be served at the same time, of course it did not happened.
The waiter was extremely nice to offer my GF to taste different wine. This was appreciated.
2- Knowledge of the menu
Our waiter did not know the type of veggies served with the Trout she ordered. And, when the fish was served, she got sick immediately and ran to the bathroom.
Waiter has been kind enough to ask if she wanted anything else, and she nicely refused and say it is ok, but mentioned that if she had knew the ingredient was in it, she would not have ordered that dish.
3-Poor management skills
Because the fish has been returned untouched, we asked for the check and to our surprise the fish was on the bill.
I understand we need to pay for the cost of the raw material and eventually the skills of the chef, however by being in the customer service, you should know better. 
Obviously you don't.
4- Chef skills
Well, we had one small bite (oyster chowder) and one appetizer (squid salad); both were outrageously salty. Those were terrible and we ended up not finishing any.
Main course: besides to the trout issue. i had the pork dish which was not very exciting with no creativity.

I do not recommend this restaurant for the point mentioned. I recommend to be more humble in your cuisine and not trying to be ""fancy"" because you can't.
Customer service is the key of our industry and i am fighting for it daily, because i care.
You don't. 
I am sure people love that place and i am still wondering why.",1.0
"Place is nice and service was great. But I got sick from the bouillabaisse. It smelled and tasted a bit off, but I assumed the chef knew what he/she was doing. I ate half of it, and sure enough 4 hours late (exactly) it hit me.
I know it's my on fault for eating half of it, but still a good chef should be tasting the food he/she makes before starting to send it out. I would go back , but would be more careful next time",1.0

"There personality still sucks.  Got food from there for the first time in a long time 2 weeks ago with horrible service.  So I came back tonight not to eat, just to  video record some of there bad habits. 
They are very unsanitary the way they work.  The man who prepared my food tonight (green shirt) was only wearing one glove however he was using two hands.  His buddy is a rebel and works with no gloves. 

I am adding a video of these poor unsanitary work habits (to youtube search for - taco king 256-31) because two weeks prior my food was treated with the same unsanitary food preparation. I got sick from the food later on.  When i told  the woman worker who was preparing the food that she was touching my food and that I wanted it made over again. The man with the green shirt in the video laughed then proceeded to put it in the bag then handed it to me.

"DO NOT EAT THERE, NO THERE EAT THERE,  ONLY  ATTRACT UNKNOWN TOURISTS  EVEN THE LOCALS WOULD NOT GO THERE, THEY WOULD HAVE PIZZA NEXT DOOR and THEY HAVE A LINE THERE WAITING.


Last night, My partner , Timmy and I ate here.  Throughout the whole  night.  he was Tossing and Turning all night after what seems to  Normal dinner.  I had mussels and Clams. Timmy on the other hand, had Spaghetti and meatball,  The service was bad.   The tap water came in room temperature.  I had to ask for ice and the waiter did not know whom/ where to obtain them.  After seeing her run back and forth the reatuatuant twice.  she finally brought us a glass of ice.   They were cheap on the bread and butter as well == We had to ask again.. The place was very inattentive.   Timmy got sick from the spaghetti all night,  I had a feeling it was either the  meatballs that look processed since you can cut it like butter  OR the gradated cheese they gave him from a canister and not freshly gradated by hand..  I called 311 and filed a report  4:35AM   ==     DO NOT EAT THERE.  I should have seen the sign since the place was empty to begin with and all the other place were crowded and people waiting in line.  There was an old man and a young lady who were wearing RED t- shirts.  I asked  one of the waiters who it was , he old me that he is a waiter.  First of all, He was on the phone carrying on for the duration of our stay, Why would any establishment would let their waiter  eat and talk in public on his cell phone in view of the public.  Also his female companion seems like she was running the restaurant .  She was running around changing the climate control in the restaurant and helping our waiter  our bill.  Their staffs are unequipped   and were not giving the necessary training / tool to run this place.   This place is a F===ing joke and so is the owner.",1.0
"Came here a couple months back. This was honestly one of the most disappointing meals I've had in the city. Everything was incredibly bland. The sangria was undrinkable (believe me, we tried). My friend got sick the following day after feeling somewhat unsettled the whole night following the meal (she had the Kebbe Kras, which she described as a Lebanese shephard's pie). I had the Moules Frites Casablanca, and the spicy tomato sauce was like something out of a jar, flavorless and not an appetizing texture. At least the mussels themselves weren't bad. Another friend ordered either the steak or the lamb, I honestly don't remember which, because either way it was flavorless. 

The server was very nice so I feel bad, but honestly I would not recommend it to anyone. The food was just not good.",1.0

"Oh my, what can I say about Midtown Buffet that hasn't been said already. 

I used to work 6 blocks north of this dump, and when my friends and I wanted a cheap Chinese food fix we would head there. By the grace of God my friend and I (who were the regulars of our office) never got sick. I can't say the same for the people that would tag along with us. 

In a perfect world, 9 bucks (including tax and tip) for a buffet in New York City should be a dream come true. You don't have to read my review to know that this place is a dream of Freddie Kruger proportions. 

The food is sub par (to be kind) and the waitstaff will hover (AND I MEAN HOVER) around your table until the bill is paid.

One day my friend and I walked there at lunchtime and the place was closed. We thought the place was another victim of the times. It turns out the place was temporarily closed by the NY Board of Health. God only knows what their grade was! I will not go into the gory details here but if you are curious go to the NY Board of Health website and plug in Midtown Buffet and STAND BACK!",1.0
"Had lunch here bc the reviews were so amazing.  I ended up disappointed with the food and service.  and sick afterward.  

ordered tofu with fish casserole.  A portion of the casserole was still frozen.  I suspect either the dish was prepared and frozen and only to be heated to serve or it was left over and frozen to serve to unsuspecting dinner.  I told the waitress about the food.  she rudely told me isn't this what you ordered.  wtf.  yes the dish is what I ordered.  but I didn't order some frozen crap.  she took it back eventually and came back in 2 mins.  likely nuked it.   at this point I said fuck it and give it a go.  bad mistake.

the tofu portion tasted mightly fine with a ton of msg.    the fish was not good at all.  you can tell the quality was terrible by the taste of it.  I left majority of it untouched.   

I ordered a noodle dish just because there are so many reviews raving about it.  it is crap.  the meat was horrible.  I had a piece of cartilage in the dumpling that came with the noodles.  I am not sure what is there to rave about.  even without the cartilage, the noodle is just average with loads of msg   flavoring is too much from msg.  which is a telltale sign of bad quality food.

"Borderline Food Poisoning.



I love this place yo. I really do but tonight really put things in perspective. Wasn't on a budget but I was in the neighborhood after checking out a highly raved about ice cream shop. So naturally, I came here for a quick bite and then off to errands.



For the last couple of visits, I've always asked that my food be WELL DONE. This doesn't mean that they don't normally cook food well done but because the dumplings are pork after all, cooking temperature/ cooking time/ properly handling of the dirtiest meat is essentially. I'm not sure whether it was undercooked or perhaps maybe the pork dumplings were sat out for too long and retained extra food bacteria or what, but after eating the 2 plate of food I started feeling a bit nauseated. 



I ordered the large order of pork & chive dumplings (this usually take the longest to come out because they make it fresh I believe), pork & cabbage dumplings (this usually take around 3-5 minutes although when I as for it to be well done/cooked thoroughly it really should take 10 minutes), and fish ball soup (never ordered this before so no comment). 



I killed the plate of pork & cabbage dumplings. 



I killed the bowl of fish balls.



I took 2 or 3 bites of the pork & chive dumplings. 



I felt the onslaught of nausea.



I had errands to run so I just went along with it thinking it might just be a minor upset stomach. I'll take care of it when I get home.



I was in that state of nausea for the rest of the day all the way through my final errand at Target. I was really contemplating or just forcing a throw up to get it out of my system at Target even though the lavatories weren't exactly the cleanest.



I got home. I threw as much of that shit up as I possibly could.



I felt better but lord knows how I feel tomorrow.



This could have been a one time thing. It was a hot summer day after all but inside the restaurant, it was blasting air conditioning. 



Cheap eats is not worth chancing another upset stomach. Tonight was the last time I'm eating here.

"I started working in the area over a month ago, and this deli is one block away from my place of work -- a quick enough jaunt to get my breakfast even when running late.  Despite many complaining about the harsh manner of the one-man show working the grill, I was super impressed by his ability to run the grill while dealing with a huge line.  It was poetry in motion that kept me coming back despite mediocre food, at best.

That all changed this past Friday.

Friday morning, I got my usual sausage on a toasted roll. (I know, disgusting.  But it's a guilty pleasure that I've indulged in for years.)  By Friday evening, I was not feeling well at all.  By Saturday, I was in the bathroom with the worst case of food poisoning I've ever experienced, accompanied by a nasty fever.  Four days later, and the only foods I can stomach are saltines and applesauce.  

If you value your health over cheap breakfast eats, stay far away from this place.  I wouldn't wish this type of food poisoning upon my worst enemy.

"I have been to this restaurant a few times now. Let me start by stating that I like the Tibetan/Nepalese options that are available here. The prices are great and the staff is very attentive too. 



However, am really sad that I am having to bring out this nasty experience I had in the very same restaurant this last weekend. Its very apparent that Indian cuisine is not this restaurant's forte, and usually I do not visit a Nepalese restaurant with the intention of ordering Indian food. But, for this time, we ordered chicken tikka masala, for a change. Plus, they had this in their menu, so anyway. What we got was simply terrible! The chicken chunks tasted as if they were cooked a few days ago and kept in the fridge in between. The main complaint however, is with the amount of food coloring that was laced into that gravy. I used my hands to eat the food, and honestly, could not get the ugly orangish tint out of my fingers for a day or two even after numerous washes.To make matters worse, that food gave me diarrhea within a few hours, and am very sure, the food coloring used is the main culprit. I agree that usually, customers will not go for this dish in the restaurant but rather order the other Nepalese dishes from the menu. And like I said, I too, am fond of those delicacies served here. Having said that, if chicken tikka is listed in the menu, someone will order it someday or the other. And if that person gets the same quality of this item as I received, this is a matter of concern. And that is the reason I, unfortunately, could not rate more than 3 stars here. I sincerely hope that the owners take note of this and take immediate action to improve the quality of that dish. Or rather, take out chicken tikka from the menu .... am sure no one will mind that.",1.0

"I have ordered delivery from here before with no problems. For some reason now they don't include a side of basmati rice with their dishes and the delivery boy demanded in a very pushy way that we paid him $2 in order to hand us our $40+ of food with a side of dry basmati rice. 

Usually when a restaurant wants to charge you extra for something or adjust your order, they call and ask you first. He just pocketed the money and gave me no receipt, which was pretty shady, especially considered we've gotten basmati rice with our orders for free every time but the last couple times we ordered.

They did however include some naan that I did not order. Both my husband and I are gluten intolerant so the food got cross contaminated somehow and now we are dealing with the very unpleasant effects of gluten poisoning. Indian food tends to be quite safe when it comes to gluten, but it's not when they send you naan you didn't ask for, your order arrives all messed up and covered in mango chutney and the delivery boy demands extra cash in a rude and pushy for something that is complimentary at every other Indian restaurant. 

Anyway, I have a terrible rash on my face and I am writing this review at 2:30am from the toilet so I am obviously never ordering from them again.

"Sadly I have to downgrade my review in light of having received food poison from their meat! I'm sure everyone would agree that is a pretty doggone good reason. I buy meat (or at least use to) at two places- 1) Costco or 2) this store.  

For the most part I usually buy at Costco because I can get a bigger quantity, better price & have to shop less often. However when I just need turkey or chicken for an immediate meal, I stop here as I'm getting off the train. A while back I did just that- stopped in after walking out of the train station to get chicken to go on top of my salad for lunch the next day. I bought spinach & ground chicken. Everything looked fine, including the expiration dates.

When I got back to my apartment, I showered & cooked the chicken while cleaning the spinach. Once the chicken was done, I of course sampled a couple of forks full then went to bed. The next morning I got ready for work, but felt weird. I got to work & the weirdness grew. I sat down at my desk & started to sweat a little, feel dizzy then almost nauseous. I went to the bathroom but only happened and as the day went on it just passed. ""Geez, what was that?"" I thought to myself. Lunch came & I ate my very delicious spinach salad with ground chicken already mixed into the dressing. 

After lunch that same weird feeling came back, this time far more severe. With in the next couple hours I was sweating like a pig going to slaughter & the nausea was rapidly growing. Given I've never had food poison before so I didn't know what was wrong with me. Moments after we closed, I was in the bathroom bent over a toilet hurling out little pieces of spinach. I had already planned to go to a concert with a friend that night & since I felt better after that moment in the stall I ignorantly thought I could still make it. 

I got there & ordered a Sprite. When my friend arrived, still early, we went next door for a lobster roll. She ordered, I didn't. We down & as we were talking, they brought over her food & immediately I knew what was wrong with me as soon as I felt my stomach drop upon seeing her food. I couldn't get to the bathroom fast enough when projectile vomit starting spewing out of my mouth! I walked back to horrified-faced friend at the table, only to race to the bathroom 6 more times, with my lunch expelling itself from both ends of my body.

Too scared to get on the train, we went to the concert & I continuously went back & forth to the bathroom. Afterward, we walked until we were confident enough that I could get on the train. I spent the rest of the weekend laying on my couch & terrified of food. I stopped eating salad for at least two months & completely stopped shopping at this store.",1.0

"Growing up in Chinatown,  I've been to several dim sum restaurants. And I gotta say,  customer service in this restaurant has to be the worst. You get seated pretty quick which is good but it doesn't mean it's a good thing considering sometimes it gets so packed that like many others you're just an ant to them and they overlook anything you may possibly need - a glass of water,  refill on the tea, calling for a dish to be made, clearing the dishes when finished or even a check calculation.There's probably 6 waiters/waitresses and there's only 2 that actually does the job of waiters/waitress. One just stands by the door and hands out the menu, and the rest is just walking around. All I'm saying is that I would like to get a refill on the water considering it's a really tiny cup without asking.  I mean how many times do you have to walk by my table? The female waitress is pretty good. She gave us our noodles & new clean plates to eat on. 
Oh yeah, by the way the seating here is pretty cramped. You'll get bumped by so many of the carts and elderly Asian women feel the need to sit with their seat all the way out. Thanks guys. I totally needed my elbow part of the jacket ruined. Totally unsatisfied.

Ensalada De Avocado sliced avocado, fresh lettuce, tomatoes and vegetables, tossed in a homemade dressing. - seriously, I could have made this salad. Like nothing about this salad was hard or complicated.....bleh.

Salchipapa sliced frankfurters & french fries - the frankfurters were the only thing that I didn't mind eating and that's not saying much

Ceviche Mixto * fresh corvina, shrimp, octopus & calamari marinated in lime juice & mixed with red onions, cilantro and rocoto hot pepper, served with sweet potato and choclo corn - heavily breaded and just not good

Juanita's Chicken one whole rotisserie chicken marinated in mama juanita's authentic recipe - eh, boring. You have to constantly dip this chicken into the green sauce just to make it semi good. I am sorry, but this dish is lame, why do people love this?

I got hot green tea, because I don't eat this sort of food and I love how they serve you tea without a saucer, where in the hell am I going to put my used tea bag?

I won't lie the food tasted good although the curry was more soupy and very difficult to eat with the nan. 

The reason I am giving 2 stars is because I am 95% sure the food made me sick! The only thing I ate yesterday was a sandwich at lunch and this at around 9:30. At about 2am I woke up with terrible stomach pains and spent about an hour of my life getting the food out of my system. TMI I know. I really do believe it is their food that made me so ill.

Didn't work.  $16 to boot for like, 6-8 small pieces of catfish. Pass!  2 stars.

Their roasted chicken or cornish hen was like a very well-seasoned roast bird and came with 2 yummy dipping sauces, and this was the tastiest of the dishes we ordered, but at $21 for a tiny bird...um....not worth it.  4 stars for taste, 2 stars for price.

Their wings?  They were okay, but not anywhere near good enough, IMHO, to be voted best wings in the US (What were you thinking HPost??)  Maybe if I hadn't come to the restaurant after hearing the hype, I'd give the wings 3 stars.

To round out the meal, they have little jugs of tepid water sitting ALL OVER the restaurant - on all the tables, all over the bar, etc - and it really makes me wonder how long they were sitting out.  I found that pretty gross.  The diet coke was $3 and flat - and nobody noticed that we didn't touch it and offer a refund or ask what was wrong.  0 stars!

I then knew it had to be from what I ate the day before. It's been hell this whole week and as I'm currently typing this, I'm still feeling the same as how I did the first day I got it. 

Before I opened the food, something told me not to eat it, but my hunger was more convincing on not listening to that something. The salad definitely looked like it was throughly washed and cleaned before being served OR/AND whoever prepared my food was such a disgusting tool, that he didn't wash his hands or wear gloves. I'm curious if there are any more yelpers out there that suffered the same kind of hell I went through at this restaurant. 

This restaurant needs to be dumped in the East River and dumped some more with the new dump site that they're proposing in the future just across the FDR.

I will be contacting the Food Safety and the FDA regarding this matter.",1.0
"I have quite the love/hate relationship with this place. The first few times I went the pizza was great, when I started venturing out to other areas of the menu, is when the problem started. 

I decided to get an order of wings and I was majorly dissappointed. They were super greasy and the skin was rubbery. I ended up tossing a lot of it. I just figured they had crappy wings.

On another occasion, I ordered a pie and some tiramisus on a Saturday and it ended up ruining the rest of my weekend.The tiramisu made me really sick. I spent the rest of the weekend with my head in the toilet and chugging Gatorade. 

I went back a few weeks ago and got myself a slice, and it was decent. Nothing to write home about, I'm just glad I didn't get sick. 

The owners can come off as rud and off putting. It's almost like all they care about is money and not about satisfying or enaging with their customers, which in my opinion isn't a way to run a business.",1.0

"how this fucking place got a grade A in it's health inspection report is way beyond me. this has to one of the top 3 worst dining experiences i've ever experienced. whoever owns this place ought to have ripped up a new asshhole!!!

-i come in, place order, and then wait. people next to me have their complimentary guac and chips. what the fuck? none for me? 

-special of the day that i ordered was mole poblano chicken. i've had better at other places. rice and beans were ok. all this was eaten at around 8pm.

we now zoom to approx. 3-4am,

-i wake up w/a nasty feeling of chest gas and abdominal pain. and i'm also tired as one can be. i feel like going back to sleep right away but man, that discomfort really really sucks. 

-to alleviate this nasty discomfort my only course of action was to spew chunks out. once i performed this disgusting, ungodly activity, back to sleep i went.

- 1 hour later a 2nd round of spewing. 

-wake up and realize going to work will not be an option that morning. this would be the day i wished i had a tv hooked up in my bathroom.

this case of food poisoning can be attributed to several factors: 
-chicken may have been undercooked, as carving with the knife seemed more difficult than the norm
-well it was the special of the day. it could have been leftovers from last week or two.

so here you have it - several 4 star reviews raving about how this place makes this and that real well, or my 1 star review on this mom and pop shit hole of an establishment that literally made me puke my fucking guts out.

"So my husband & I had heard good things about this restaurant and decided to order out from them. We ordered the chicken and beef curry. There was so much spice in these two curries that my husband actually got sick and we ended up throwing away the uneaten portion. As Keralites, we've tried different variations of both chicken and beef curries but this was just careless combinations of whatever spice they got their hands on, that day. Would never order from here again & would not recommend. Def not authentic South Indian cuisine.",1.0
"I was very disappointed in the taste of the bagel, which I received by 2 day shipping. The freshness was there, but the taste was like cardboard. I really got sick after eating this with butter and melted cheese on it, which usually gives other brands of gluten free bagels a pretty good taste. $4 per bagel, $2.50 per dinner roll and $10 for shipping for something that truly is a great bread replacement is pricey but worth it on occasion. In this case I just feel robbed of the money. If I lived in NYC I would take the product back to the store immediately.",1.0
"The service was terrible. And I got sick after I had breakfast and ended up wasting a day on my hotel bed. Rest of my trip was ruined because it was my last day there.  I noticed that the sanitation rating wasn't rated there after I ate. :/ 

I had the lumberjack breakfast. It tasted alright, nothing special -except the feeling afterwards. :(

The waitress was awful. Took forever to get our order. The gentleman next to us was waiting as well just to pay and leave. The frustration was mutual. When we finally got our food. The gentleman was able to cash out. And then a two ladies came sat down after and waited even longer to order their food. By the time they were able to order we had asked for our check and didn't receive it until the girls got their food and was halfway to eating it. Terrible experience.",1.0
"Probably not my favorite place to have Asian food. Though there's a ton to choose from and it's in a great neighborhood, I got sick when I ate there and I had eaten nothing but a granola bar that day. They put a ton of MSG in the food and they do not use natural ingredients for at least half of the dishes. Not my favorite place, unfortunately.",1.0
"My wife and I visited Gallaghers last night, 1/24/15.  We ordered the same meal, exception being I ordered a Caesar salad.  Within hours of the meal I was sick to my stomach.  Vomiting, cramps the normal food poisoning symptoms.  My wife got out unscathed.  However it really sucks to pay $200 for a meal for two and end up with food poisoning.

The service was great, but I would not eat there again and don't recommend it to anyone.  You should expect more from a restaurant like Gallaghers.

"Worse place in middle village 
I had two bad experiences at London Lennie
A while ago I went with my friend to eat there after I told my friend that I heard their fish is really fresh 
What a surprise 
My friend and I are professional engineers 
I do have French accent because I wasn't born here 
We were treated very bad like we are 2nd class citizen 
I was giving an extremely hot boiling food and when I mentioned it to owner 
He said it is not their fault if i burned my tongue he said in a very  mean way 
My friend and I felt that they all are very racist and prejudice against foreigners 
Today I made a mistake and went there again and said I will buy the fish and make it at home so I bought filet of sole 
What a mistake 
I got extremely sick from their filet of sole 
Abdominal pain nauseous and vomiting and headaches etc..
When I called them up the manager was very rude and told me that it is not from their fish at all and added that maybe I was sick 
And insisted that it must be something else I ate 
I told him No 
That's the only thing I had this evening 
He gave me lots of stress and argue with me 
Didn't care that I got sick from their fish and refused to give me the money back or replacing the fish 
He wasn't even sorry that I got sick from their fish he just kept saying ""it is from something else you ate""
He seems to be very racist over the phone 
When he heard my accent 
I will never go back to that restaurant
1. Service was bad 
2. Food was extremely hot 
3. Both owner and managers are extremely rude and mean 
4. Very racist and don't respect foreigners

"*You have to give at least a star otherwise they wouldn't have gotten any!*
I went to Chef Yu for the first time earlier this month as my colleagues thought that it was a good lunch spot. I hesitantly agreed as I know that I can be pretty particular in the places that I eat. To my surprise the restaurant "" looked sanitary"". They were not friendly and service sucked- But very regrettably I ordered the broccoli with brown sauce and fried rice as my colleagues ordered the broccoli/shrimp and brown rice. I only ate some of the food when I went back to the office and saved the rest for later. One of my biggest mistakes was eating the friend rice when it was a little "" soft"". I just assumed that it was sweating in the box a little( but that wasn't it). I was able to put the food in the fridge and took it with me after work.
So the night comes and I decided to stop by my mother's house as I was going vacation the next day! I left the food with hehe because we both agreed would take it home and not have time to eat it that night. The next morning I wake up to go to the airport and feeling fine at first... Next thing you know I am running back and forth to the restroom at the airport and can't hold anything in ( on either end... Sorry!) I felt so sick and didn't feel that it was wise to get on a 4 1/2 hour flight and went to urgent care. (Might I add American Airlines staff showed no compassion whatsoever!! ) I immediately texted my co worker to see if they were ok which they said they were. I knew it was the food! So I get picked up and go to urgent care and the doctor reports that he thinks it's a stomach virus! I was so annoyed! But the craziest part is that my mother shared with me you know what it was more than likely that rice! She said she opened everything that night and the broccoli and side salad was fine but the rice was looking VERY soft as though it may not have been   fresh and just threw a little sauce on it. I might have noticed that myself if I don't eat the rice out of the box... Moral is, I WOULD NEVER EAT AT CHEF YU AGAIN! I missed out on my flight that day and the next and couldn't get on another until 2 days later. One top of that still had to come back on the same day or AA wanted at least another 1,000 extra... Right! So as though everything wasn't already sucky, I was removed from my returning non-stop flight to a connecting one...All because of Chef Yu's bad Fried rice!!!! Who knows what else is old in there and can give you straight food poisoning?! YUCK!!! SO DISGUSTED!! Hope this will save you from missing work, school or your vacation or just staying alive!",1.0
"I ordered three times here and the first two times were good. Fast delivery, Sushi was good. Not amazing but nothing to complain about.

BUT: I ordered Sushi on Friday and got food poisoning. I had to go the clinic where the doctor diagnosed with me FOOD POISONING. I was sick for nearly six days, I spent huge amounts of money of medication (despite insurance) and taxi to and from the clinic. No way I could have taken the subway. I was dangerously dehydrated and could barely manage to sit.

But the third time was absolute FOOD POISONING! I reluctantly compromised on eating at this place bc it was near by and a few hours later I threw up my life! was throwing up pretty much all night, and the next day had the most terrible body aches and fever. I repeat DO NOT EAT HERE! Unless you like getting food poisoned...",1.0
"I thought the food was a little too sweet, but otherwise tasty.  The free shrimp chips were a nice touch.  Love those...

The meat/fish portions are ridiculously small: my beef red curry had hardly any beef.  My tom kha soup had one sad lonely shrimp in the whole soup, all by its lonesome.  You really had to dig around to find beef in my wife's noodle dish.

But what trumps all this is my wife fell quite seriously ill eating food from this restaurant.

We had dinner at 10pm.  In the morning I woke up at around 9:30am to the sound of my wife violently vomiting in the bathroom so badly that her whole body was shaking.

She repeatedly vomited, had diarrhea, body aches, nausea, body tremors, weakness, and joint pain (*) for nearly the whole day.  I was so scared for her.

It's now 4:30pm as I write this, and she's just now feeling strong enough to eat some bread and drink water from bed.

I know this can happen in any restaurant, but we had ordered over $60 worth of food only for my wife to have the most agonizing day in her life since giving birth (and at least she got some morphine and a baby out of that one!)  And you should know that my wife is a strong woman with high tolerance for feeling crappy.  She's not a girl that gets knocked out by small things.  Whatever this was, it must have been bad-ass to take my wife down like this.

Never again.

Allegedly, the house dressing is vegan. However, after eating it on a beet salad with only beans and arugula, I was sick. I am not sure why.... But the dressing clearly did not agree with me.

Blackened tofu for your omelette substitutions is a couple dollars more. Fruit salad and some sides look vegan. Still, only a veg salad,  not vegan unless you ask for it to be vegan.

"I think this place is really overrated. As an avid ramen eater from California and having been to a lot of ramen places in both Northern and Southern California, I think I'm a good judge. Momofuku is definitely a trendy ramen place. I got the spicy miso ramen (smoked chicken and poached egg). The smoked chicken flavor was a little too overpowering in my opinion and overtook the entire bowl. The poached egg was also not poached correctly; it was still cold and pretty much raw in my opinion. The noodles were a good texture, I will give it that. I got super sick after eating here, so I would say my experience was mediocre at best. My sister ordered the Momofuku ramen (pork belly, pork shoulder, and poached egg). She said it was good, but also overrated. I think we just have too many delicious California ramen places to compare to, so this place was overhyped and overpriced might I add.

I might come back for the pork buns, but definitely not the ramen.",1.0

"WARNING: I got very bad food poisoning from this place!  Stay away!!!! 

I work in the area and have been eating at this place regularly for the last few months. And by regular I mean a few times a week, in the restaurant and also take out. 

Went for lunch on Monday and ordered pork gyoza, udon lunch special with hot and sour soup. Well, within a few hours after eating I was really sick. Like really sick. Two days later, I was still really sick and hauled myself to the doctor who confirmed that it was food poisoning. Overall I was really sick for almost 5 days. I know I got it from this place (I don't take lightly writing a review that I got food poisoning but I felt like I needed to warn people) based on the fact I didn't eat anything else that day and the doctor confirmed the timing of eating the food with the onset of the symptoms. 

So please don't risk getting sick and go elsewhere!  Something weird about the day I was there when I got sick - they brought out our food, then said something to each other in Japanese or Chinese. And then brought our food back to the kitchen for a few min before bringing it back out. It was just weird. 

Food poisoning aside, the service was generally not great. We always had to ask specifically for water then they seemed annoyed I asked for it. If you needed extra sauce or something I would get an attitude. 

But the food poisoning is enough to stay away. :(",1.0
"Not sure what the hype is with this place. I went to sushi shop for lunch last week as a good friend has raved about it for over a year. The concept is a bit annoying cuz you feel like you're in a fast food place, even though the restaurant itself is really nice. But ok, got on line, ordered my lunch and the guy at the register tells me to grab my lunch box from the to-go section. I wanted fresh sushi, not to-go. We were eating there not back at the office, but the guy insisted so I paid and grabbed my to-go box and found a table with my friend (whom was getting her sushi freshly made). My lunch did not look that fresh, but I ate it anyway. My sushi was mediocre at best. Did not even taste that great. Went back to work and a few hours later started getting sick. Ended up with food poisoning. Had the runs, nausea, you name it. This place got me sick with their overpriced, nasty sushi. Be careful if you eat there. Demand for fresh sushi.

I can get better sushi in the to-go section of my local supermarket for half the price and it tastes better too.",1.0
"Nice new place. It was packed because of March Madness, so there was a bit of a wait. They were turning tables as quick as they could. All the girls were very friendly, and our waitress Adriana checked in on us several times. Enjoyable experience, wings tasted good but I think they were too greasy, as they didn't sit well. I would try them naked next time. My friend raved about his Jamaican rum wings. Lots of TVs!  Cons-no bathrooms on the ground floor. Cheese sticks were meh. Not worth the $9. Beer is between $7-$8 each. I'd blame location for that (MSG)
****Orginally I gave this place 4 stars. But my friend also didn't feel well after eating here. He agreed that the wings were probably too greasy.

I was not impressed with the presentation and I felt the dish was lacking so I asked for a side of basil which I was told I would need to pay an additional $2.The dish was overall unappetizing as the chicken tasted old and the potatoes were undercooked.

"There are so many reasons why I dislike FiDI, the biggest one being the fact that the lunch choices are so lackluster.  Thanks to Dig Inn, I now have another one to add to the list.

I was stuck at work on a Sunday and was perusing my options.  I had never ordered from here before, and the reviews on here and seamless were good, so I gave them a try.  This is what I got:

- Lemon Chicken
- Braised Beef 
- Un-Fried Veggie Rice
- Grilled Summer Veggies
- String Beans w/ Potatoes
- Spinach & Strawberry Salad
- Roasted Red Pepper w/ Toasted Almonds (salad dressing)

Delivery time was an hour, give or take, and I had to call them -- not okay.  Then, the delivery guy calls me and tells me he is downstairs, so I take the elevator down 40+ flights, walk to the lobby, go outside, and still have to wait for him.  Listen, I get that delivery people don't like to wait for you to stroll down to get your food, but never had I been made to wait that long.

Anyway, the bag is soggy because the sauce and heat made the cardboard container damp, which leaked through to the paper bag.  While I was happy my food wasn't in styrofoam, I had to put paper towels down on my desk as a placemat.

Now, onto the portions: I had ordered the large plate, with an additional side of meat, for an additional fee.  Is it wrong for me to assume that I would get a large plate of my original order, PLUS a separate side of meat??  Instead, what I got was everything I ordered crammed into one continuous container, with the flavors of thing x melding into the juices of y and z.   Oh, and the container ain't that big to begin with, lemme tell ya.  ""$16+ for this?!  Really??"" I wondered, as I stared at my plate (I really wish I had the container to give you dimensions, but think 3/4 of a macbook air).  Not only that, if I didn't pay extra for the braised beef, I would have gotten that amount in the chicken, no?  I would have rather not paid more for some beef (which was too sweet, anyway), and gotten the same amount of food with just chicken.  (Speaking of which, I was imagining a breaded chicken francese-type dish, but it was just chunks of skinless breast that was soaked in lemon juice.  Not bad, but nothing spectacular.)

Now, onto my major problem.  Okay, so fine; I was willing to write the experience off as whatever, since the food was a little better than mediocre, and like I said, my standards for FiDi are low.  HOWEVER, this place made me sick.  Like, literally sick.  Someone in a previous review mentioned they got food poisoning from it, but I chalked it up to a random incident.  WRONG.  Sparing everyone the gross details, I was sick for two days straight with an upset stomach.  I had ordered the dressing to use on a salad later, but ended up tossing it.  

One plus, though.  You could tell they used quality ingredients like they went shopping at the farmer's market (which, reading the above, sounds like an oxymoron, I know).  Judging by the other positive reviews, maybe I was just unlucky, but know this -- I thought that, too, when I read the other food poisoning review.  If ordering from here, realize that it may be a gamble.",1.0

It looked and tasted fresh enough, but then ensued the one of the worst bouts of food poisoning I've ever had. I felt like I was going to die. After seeking medical help it turns out I got gastroenteritis, and was incapacitated in bed on antibiotics for days. Yikes. BF got some sort of basic fried eggs deal, he was fine.

Beautiful place inside .. Old with lots of character. Met our friends from Florida there - so this place wasn't about the food but more for socializing .. But when we did order the food - oh boy! I ordered a burger - I don't even think it should be called that - all bread - the burger patty was so thin - I couldn't even find it in it!  Go here for a beer - and not food! There are way better restaurants in NYC for food. My friends daughter ordered a kids meal and she got sick from it! Not a very good food experience here!,1.0
"We walked 5 miles in this heat excited to eat here.... Initial service was fine. But after appetizer orders kicked in, it was almost like the waiter disappeared. 1 burger took 45 minutes. And when it gets to us, it tastes like cheap gas station meat. I got sick shortly after. So sad, had high hopes. Mac and cheese was disgusting as well. Tastes like I was eating watered cheese.",1.0
"I'm envious of the photos I've seen posted. My burger looked nothing like these burgers. My friend got sick twice in the bathroom. I didn't even finish my tater tots...god, I love tater tots.

Was it an off day? Was it the TIME of day? I'm not sure. All I know is that $45 dollars later, half of our meal was in the NYC sewer system and the other half missing off the plate.",1.0
"This place has quickly become the ""it"" lunch spot among my peers here around the Columbia Medical Center. Of course they have the standard cheap prices and timely take out but with an actual area to sit, this establishment is sort of a ""luxury"" chinese take-out place, if there is such a word for ""luxury"" in the Chinese-Take-Out dictionary. So what do you get here? What do you get at any Chinese take-out? Our good old friend General Tso of course! And how is it? Well, I'll put it like this:

Let's say your office has 5 bathrooms and each day, a random bathroom doesn't work, In fact, when you go to flush it, all the feces and waste that has accumulated that day comes flying out and you become submerged in all your office's breakfast and lunch the entire day. That is how I would describe this General Tso's, meaning that 4 out of 5 times I've had it, it's been a very pleasurable experience. You have that General Tso itch and when you bite into it, it's absolutely orgasmic, like taking a long awaited dump and seeing it all go down the toilet with one simple flush. But then, that 1 out of 5th time, I took my dump and when I went to flush, nothing happened. Instead, it all came back out in the form of some very uncomfortable food poisoning (to put it nicely). 

I've eaten the Gen Tsos probably 10 times and had food poisoning twice. I guess the fact that I puked once and still went back for more is a sign that the chicken is pretty addicting but having born the wrath of a General Tso not in his prime but rather old, decrepit, and confined to an assisted living facility, I'll have to say that I'll not be taking any dumps in the office anytime soon.

Aside from the General Tsos chicken, the fried rice is pretty decent. Otherwise, everything else was average at best. Even the french fries were kinda bad :/ Will I come back? In all honesty, probably. But I guarantee that I will be squeezing my legs together holding on for as long as I can.",1.0

"Warning : Overpriced Tourist Trap ! 
Place did not look busy considering in heart of NYC, but walked in anyway for a meal because all reviews.
Big Big mistake ! 
Food was not fresh, had to send one dish away tasted spoiled, finished the meal anyway. 
 Several hours later, having serious stomachache & diarrhea after eating in this place ! 
Called the restaurant to report, Manger said, nobody complained so far today, your problem, go to hospital.   This was only meal I had today and I am having all the symptoms of food poisoning.  Spent over $60 for 2 dishes, got food poisoning, rude inconsiderate remarks from the manager.  
If you have a strong stomach and don't mind old/ spoiled food disguise d w. Bbq sauces and mayo, 
then this is a perfect place for you. 
Overpriced nasty food and sevice.  More likely will have to go see a doctor during my first day of NYC vacation all because of their food.  
How do you serve spoil food to customers and tell them to just go to hospital, not their problem... 
Unbelievably disgusting food & services , you'll experience when you dine in this place. 
Very regretful choice for us (tourist traps !)",1.0
"went there on sunday night 4/12 at night, when arrived they were playing spanish music (in a japanese restaurant, which already seems suspicious). ordered and ate a bowl of Miso ramen, and drove home. An hour later I started heave vomiting and diarrhea, and it lasted all night and through next day!!

I had the falafel sandwich and it was delicious. I might have to try it one more time before ruling it out entirely.",1.0
"REPOST OF MY REVIEW OF THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL:

I had always had a lot of respect for The Four Seasons brand, and excitedly purchased a Gilt deal for Mike and I to have a romantic date night dinner at The Garden Restaurant.  I expected a grand, lush room, and decadent food presented by experienced servers.  This ended up being one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.

When we arrived for our 8pm reservation, we gave the hostess our voucher and were brought to a table that only had placemats on it.  I looked around the room and the (many) tables that were not occupied were filthy.  At any diner I have ever been to, when a customer leaves, the tables are immediately bussed--wiped down quickly and then placemats, clean utensils, and napkins are put out.  I expected at least that standard of tidiness from The Four Seasons.  

The mother-daughter duo at the next table were irritating, but we could have had that issue anywhere.  They complained incessantly about their food but at the time, I just thought they seemed like the type of people who enjoy whining.  As I learned later on that evening (they had arrived before we did), the food was that bad.  The mother, which was not the fault of The Garden Restaurant, began flossing at the table, which was deplorable.  What made it even worse was that she subsequently asked the waiter for a toothpick, which she used to continue her dental hygiene routine, and then left the floss and toothpick on the table.  Said items were still on the table when we left.

Our deal included two glasses of unsatisfactory wine, an appetizer, two entrees, and a side dish to share.  For our appetizer, we chose the cheese platter.  The cheeses, crackers, and various fruits were decent enough.  What was unbelievable was that the waiter had no clue what the cheeses were.  I'm hardly a cheese connoiseur but I do know, for instance, that goat cheese is not ""soft cheddar.""  Mike and I created a cheese plate that was just as good, if not better, from cheeses and crostini purchased from Stop & Shop, and nuts and raisins from CVS just a week before.  Not only that, but our's was on our beautiful Michael Aram cheeseboard which only enhanced the experience for us and our friends.

The entree course was frightening.  Mike's duck was fine but my chicken was suspiciously undercooked.  I barely touched it.  The truffle fries we picked for our shared side dish were OK but I did not particularly want fries and they are rather hard to ruin anyway.  As soon as we got home that night, I was ill.  I clearly had some form of food poisoning, due to the undercooked chicken.  I was sick again the next morning.

Overall, The Garden Restaurant was terrible, between the amateurish service, dirty tables, and food that at best was merely satisfactory.  The room itself was attractive enough but so are basically all hotel restaurants. Most of the clientele were glamorous types (except our neighbors, of course), and I cannot imagine they were pleased either.  The Four Seasons should be ashamed to have such a poor restaurant associated with it.  I will be contacting Gilt about this meal as well.",1.0
"I actually ordered from here a lot because everything has tasted great. HOWEVER, I've consistently had serious bathroom problems within 24 hours of eating their food. I thought maybe it was a coincidence, but then, 2 days ago I placed my usual order: sabih sandwich with a green kale salad. I ended up having THE WORST FOOD POISONING OF MY LIFE. I was sh*tting and vomiting all day. I am obviously never eating here again.",1.0
"Had food poisoning after eating sushi at cafe East,  and it's not the first time. Cleaningness of the establishment is beyond unacceptable. Non of the staff uses gloves,  they got trash right next to where they prepare food,  and refrigerator used to keep sushi fresh obviously doesn't keep anything fresh. Sushi is always dry and has after taste,  which means it is not renewed after certain amount of time,  but same product  sold the next day,  if not for two days. I am working on filing a complaint with the health department. Horrible place. Do not eat their sushi or fruits,  if you care about your health.",1.0
"So I have really mixed feelings about this place. I would say without my experience, this would be a solid four star experience for me, but based on what happened, I'm going to give it a three and the benefit of the doubt and maybe revisit it in the future if I happen to be in Manhattan and want sushi.

The setting: my friend and I really needed to grab a quick dinner before I jumped on a flight. We made reservations and even though we were not so timely with getting there, the staff was super, super nice. Seriously the kindest staff that I have ever experienced. We were seated and placed our orders and also requested to get the food sooner than later if possible. Our waiter definitely honored our request and got us our food in less than ten minutes which was awesome. 

The food itself was pretty decent I guess. Pretty solid cuts of fish. I got the chirashi and there was a nice variety of different types of fish of reasonable cut sizes. Fish didn't strike me as odd. Wasabi was kinda subpar though and a bit on the flavorless side. I thought it was kind of cool that their tamago was branded with Hatsuhana on it.

Final bill for two was $55 pretax which is decent given that it is sushi and it is Manhattan.

Cue one hour later: Me vomiting in a taxi from food poisoning. It's been three days and I'm still trying to get my appetite back. So this is where it's tricky. I did eat other things during the day so maybe it wasn't Hatsuhana. Or maybe I just got unlucky because I had a bad reaction to one fish or unclean hands preparing my fish. Unclear. Since I can't really isolate and say Hatsuhana was the problem, I don't feel right giving them a super negative review, so will settle for a four. Pretty sure I got my food poisoning from here though.

tldr; seems like a respectable place--good reviews and reasonable portions though pretty expensive relative to the sushi I get in California. I got food poisoning from this place... which is unfortunately how I'm going to remember this place, but it wasn't so bad otherwise? staff is super polite and friendly!",1.0
"The restaurant was fine, great service and atmosphere, especially right before the holidays. The food was great too; the problem is that I got food poisoning, probably from red meat or one of the sides - spinach or mashed potatoes. Have been having stomach pains and taking antibiotics for last few days. Not sure how that could happen in upscale steakhouse in NYC.",1.0
"This place is poor/OK. But I don't get the extremes either way. If you are giving it 5 stars u r either 1) a friend of owner or 2) a primate who has never had a 5 star meal. If you are giving it 1 star, your expectations are way too high. It is a bagel place. It can only be so good. But it has gotten bad recently. Comments? I agree it closes way too early. Support the neighborhood. Stay up until 8. You'll probably make 25% of your day in those two hours. Pay attention. Orders are often wrong. Consistancy. Depending on who makes your sandwich, you will have either a huge or a tiny sandwich. Be friendly. You are not in Breezy Point. Not everyone is named Paddy Obrien and works for NYFD. Bay Ridge is diverse. Grow up. Turn on the AC. The last time I went there I got full on food poisoning. You cannot have food out on the counter when it is 90 degrees. All said, I find this place lazy, unattentive to neighborhood and I bet it closes within the next two years unless it changes its whole approach.",1.0
"If you have low expectations, love to eat shitty food, and are expecting to be immobile for an entire day afterwards, then eat here! My friend and I ordered delivery from Stillwater because it seemed to have pretty good options. That was NOT the case, however, when we received our meal. I got a salad, which could have been better if I'd ordered it from McDonalds. I also got ""pasta with marinara sauce"" aka macaroni and cheese with KETCHUP MIXED IN. And don't worry... that's not all folks! My friend got a chicken sandwich that gave her FOOD POISONING the next day. Fucking food poisoning, people! The food is so bad that I decided to actually write this review, which is seriously saying something. In the wise words of Avril Lavigne, ""Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?""

"Since my office is in the area, so I often walk passed here, and finally last Thursday my friend was in the mood for Chinese, so I thought this will be perfect, we can try this place out. 

We went there around 6:30pm, the place not that busy, they have few tables people seated on it

We order the General Tso Chicken, Green Pepper Steak and a Steam Fish. 

General Tso Chicken was really bad, can't even taste the chicken, lots of flour on it, Green Pepper Steak was okay, and the Steam Fish is okay too

But the problem is, after we finished, I kinda got sick in my stomach. 

I wasn't feeling well at all, I had to go home and laid down 

Not sure what's going on, but I was afraid of Chinese for awhile. lol

I went to Talia's steakhouse and the food was honestly really good. I had the chicken with a side of vegetables. All went well until 4 AM when I woke up with terrible food poisoning.

"When you suffer from food poisoning on the night after eating at a place, you know that restaurant won't be getting good reviews. 
The caesar salad I had tasted decent until I actually got to the chicken--which tasted severely undercooked, or like chicken from a can. That probably should have tipped me off.
My boyfriend had wings, which I tried a little bit of and was not impressed. 
Pretty much nothing tasted fresh, and the only good part about the experience is that it wasn't expensive. Except that, you know, I'd rather not pay any money at all for something that makes me incredibly sick.
So yeah never ever coming here again--diners, beware!",1.0
"Food was good enough but I got awful food poisoning after eating here.

"Zero stars.

Besides fatty gross meat with the spinal cord chunk still in it that looked like it had been sitting there forever, ten servers all helping one person, and squinting at me as if I were speaking an obscure Martian dialect when I was saying things from their menu, my reward for enduring this was the worst food poisoning I have had in a LOOOONNNNG time.

Was going here quite often for the okay food, it was filling and sufficient for a quick lunch.

I trusted them and continue coming in. Today i purchased the chicken teriyaki and dint notice the cooking time, upon digging in i noticed that i ate raw chicken which wasn't all cooked!!

My second visit here. What a disappointment! Cash only. Forced everyone of us to order own ramen. Broth was oily and fatty made me sick after eating their ramen. Pork smelled. We could not even finish one bowl of their ramen out of three and left. Not worth wait for thirty minutes on snowy day. Will never come back.,1.0

He privately messaged me, saying that they are not taking any responsibility for my sickness. I wish he would spend more time taking care of the restaurant instead of composing long unreasonable emails to customers. Maybe then less people would get sick after eating there!  
I should have gone to the doctor the day of and gotten a proper diagnosis so I could have sued the place. Unbelievable!",1.0
"I have been a loyal customer of Juventinos and was utterly disappointed with my experience tonight.  When I arrived with a friend, the place was empty and the owner/manager told us we had to sit in the back of the restaurant, even after we asked to sit in the front near the window. The place was empty most of our meal and we couldnt understand why we had to sit in the way back.  Now my friend and I are two good  looking cats so we took it as some personal knock. 

Food could have been better and Juventino even gave us a complimentary dessert cause we think he felt bad.  I ate the choco mousse because I felt obligated as it came from Juventino himself.  Bad idea because Ive been feeling sick for the last two hours since we left.  

Dont think I will be back as I felt betrayed being a loyal customer and getting tossed in the back. We even had appetizers and a bottle of wine but will not support an establishment as I was treated tonight.  Your loyal customers always come first.",1.0
"The musicians performing in the window is what lured my friend and I into this establishment. While the music and ambience was lovely, the food and service was not.

I had the chicken tikka which is my go to order of any new Indian restaurant that I go to. If you can't get this right, you're not going to get anything else right. When my meal finally came instead of placing it on the table the waiter proceeded to scoop the dish onto a plate on my table. Awkward. What was put on my plate was obviously stewed and not ""barbecued over charcoal in the tandoori"" as the menu describes. My friend ordered a curry and in minutes the poor guy felt instantly sick. Naan wasn't bad and the kala bhajee appetizer was actually good. 

We waited 1/2 hour for our check to come. At this point the place felt like a dungeon that we would never escape from. We were given complimentary ice cream but at that point we just needed fresh air and $50 of better food. Will definitely not be returning.",1.0
"SIGH. I came back to you because you were SO CLOSE to a 5 star rating that I thought I'd bring my BFFL visiting from HK and treat her to a nice dinner and take the opportunity to go up in stars.

This visit, I made a reservation. I got there 20 minutes before my reservation, my friend was already there. The hostess handed us off to someone else and as they are walking us to our table she says, ""we're trying something new out tonight-- we're telling all of our patrons that there is a 4 hour seating limit. We've been having a problem with people lingering longer at their table."" 

UGH. Why? Why tell us that? If I had to deliver that message I would only relay that message over to a party of 5 or more (the people who are most likely to go over 4 hours/ although I'd argue that it would be understandable) but it left such a negative distaste to start our night with. 

Then we were squeezed in between two other tables that were literally 3 inches away from us. I get that this place gets packed and they want to maximize on being able to sit as many people as they can but I will always choose a restaurant that takes patrons' dining comfort over anything else. Who wants to literally rub elbows with complete strangers at a pricey restaurant?!

To tack on even more whoever came over with a suit to serve us water spilled water on me. And just when I thought the experience was over I felt sick when I got home.

Needless to say, I'm not coming back here.

Finally made it here.  Was it worth the trek from Manhattan?  Perhaps.  Were some of the dishes really as bad as the (few) worst 1 star reviews said?  Unfortunately, yes.

Eggplant Napoleon looked so good that we ordered two.
Problem was the eggplant pieces were way too deep fried with too many bread crumbs.  I have never had a more heavily fried vegetable.  Couldn't even taste the actual eggplant or the flavor of the baba ghanouge underneath.  The tomato basil type 'salsa' surrounding the dish was pretty good.  Though the flavors just didn't seem to all blend right to me.  Really wish we only had gotten 1 of these dishes.

Lebne - the worst I have ever had.  Thick and creamy but very bitter and sour.  Not really edible.

Hummus- same thing - barely edible and strange flavor.  Should have returned but not good at that.  The worst store brand would be a ton better.

Beet salad- very average.  Pre-made, served ice refrigerator cold.  Said it came with walnuts but there were about 2 half pieces in there.

Brussels sprouts-  these were quite flavorful and good.  Not too oily either even though the menu said they are fried.  

Chicken fatoush -- good thing I ordered this (due to 1 reviewer saying it was the best thing he had).  Perfect blend of mint, spices, cucumbers, very fresh red tomatoes and tender seasoned chicken with perfect small amount of dressing.  Star of the night.

Pita bread served tasted like stale Sahara bread.

Portions are great. Service:  fast and friendly.
Overall it was a fun experience even though half the dishes were a real miss.  I also felt sick the entire next 2 days after eating here. :(
We were too full to try their famed dessert seen on 'best thing I ever ate'.   Good to know they have takeout available right next door.  Wouldn't return for food, but that dessert might be good.",1.0

"STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU WANT FOOD POISONING!!

Against my better judgement, I opted to eat at the airport before my flight out . Your order is placed through an iPad and many of the items (i.e. meatball parm) was  nowhere to be found. I ended up ordering the fish with pickles and tartar. I found that the food came out within a reasonable amount of time and if you aren't there when your order is called, good luck finding someone up front. I think the original instructions said to order, walk to the desk and pay, and come back to pick up with a stamp. Noone asks for the stamp so I picked up my food and paid after.

The sandwich was sad looking, pickles overfried, and tartar was somehow smacked on the corner of the 4inch bun. This was the only thing I ate that afternoon other than fruit and judging by the fact that 3 people who had the same dinner as me are fine... I'm almost certain that this joint was the reason why I am currently on my deathbed and the bathroom is my best friend.",1.0

"This place has been on my list for a year. Finally got to try it and I was disgustingly disappointed. The staff at the entrance was nice, but the waiter and bartender were not attentive. Plus, the bone marrow and black label burger made me sick. I'll get into that later

Service: So when we got there, we sat at the bar. Don't get me wrong, the whiskey My boyfriend ordered was good, but I asked for a water TWICE and never got it. We had the bone marrow first and finished it and nobody came to clear the plate. Even when they brought the burger over, they didn't remove the big bone marrow plate. The table was already small enough. With the big bone marrow plate, burger plate, and fries, there was no room left for our cups. And lastly, it took us forever to get the check. 

Food: we had the bone marrow ($21) and black label burger ($28). The bone marrow was really rich and fat. The bread that came with it was good and the beets (?) paired with it was good. There were 3 bones. After eating it, I felt very sick and the urge to throw up. While waiting for the burger (20 more minutes) I drank water to help the nausea. 

Felt better by the time burger arrived. Burger was cooked to medium rare as requested. It was really thick. But that was all the things to applaud it for. Burger bun was standard, one slice of tomato and Green. Fries were nothing special -- thin, hard, unevenly salted. After eating only half the burger, I felt sick again and had to step outside  

Overall, really disappointed by minetta tavern experience. $$$ on yelp, supposedly one of best burger places and steak house in city. Expected better service and better tasting food. And above all, did not think I would get sick. I ended up going home and throwing up $100 worth of food.",1.0

An hour and a half later I called the restaurant to see where my order was, only to be put on hold. But her version of hold was putting the phone down while she talked to her boyfriend on her cell phone, and I got to hear every word of her conversation. It was riveting stuff. 

10 minutes later, after she and her boyfriend decided who would hang up first, she hung up and finally got to us. She said the food was coming, which we knew would be the only response we would get at that point. 


The food showed up 20 minutes later and the delivery guy was incredibly rude. He took my card and wrote down the information then would not give it back to me. He said I had to sign the receipt which is fine, but would not give me back my card until I did so. As my personal property, he had no right to hang onto it and give me unwarranted attitude when I asked for it back. 

After signing and getting my card back, I took my receipt and walked away, only to be chased down by the delivery boy who was yelling at me, demanding I give him back his receipt. I had given him the signed copy and took the second copy but apparently both are his and I don't get a receipt. That totally makes sense to me.

Empanadas were tolerable and the arroz con pollo was a mess. The Maduros were shameful, and only 3 slices were given with the 13$ meal. I am not a small child. 

Within an hour of eating the food, I had horrible stomach pains and got sick. I felt that was the only appropriate way to end my experience with EM. 

Stay away, force yourself to look an extra 5 minutes on yelp and I promise you'll have a better experience elsewhere.",1.0
I used to love this place but I will not be back.  I was horribly food poisoned this weekend from the shrimp in the quinoa bowl I purchased Friday at 4pm.,1.0
"I'm used to ordering Baluchi from the UES so decided to give this one in Kips Bay a try. BIG mistake. I ordered the same lamb rogan josh I always order from the other location. I'm not sure if the cook accidentally dropped a bottle of oil in this dish because that is all I could see and taste. And I felt sick afterwards from all the greasiness....

Shame on you on Baluchis for serving food like this. There are a 100 better places in nearby Curry Hill that serve decent Indian food.",1.0
"Unfortunately I wish I could give this place more stars because the people are so nice but it made me a bit sick. 

Probably mostly my fault because it was cross contaminated with gluten . 

We picked this spot because it was right off the shuttle and we were starving. The menu was super extensive . And it took about 30 minutes to get our food. 

The eggs were runny and the potatoes weren't good at all. 

My friends got burgers, and wrap and they felt the same way. But the fries were good. And the prices were cheap",1.0
"Went here last night, after a long time. I used to love 16 handles 
Used to go near nyu, when they first opened up. This one is soo dirty , I felt soo sick

"It's a great place to watch football but had one of the worst bar foods i've ever had.

We went here because they play football without any loud music over it so you can actually watch and HEAR the game and there's a decent number of TVs so you can watch it wherever you're located in the bar.

However if you decide to go, stick to the drinks and eat elsewhere. The chicken fingers and wings were obviously not made to order but just reheated from an old batch. The meat was tough, completely dry and just plain disgusting.  We were so hungry that we ate it regardless and felt sick for the rest of the night. 
Nacho's were greasy and not that great either.",1.0
"My friends liked this place, but personally would need a lot of convincing to come back. Service was good, waitress was personal and friendly. Crowd was young. Shrimp was yummy, but pretty spicy for mild/medium sauce. It was torturous yet so beautiful eating it at the same time. 

But the crab is a whole different story... or the first time in a very, very long time in my life, I felt sick after I left the restaurant and threw up on the street. It was nasty.",1.0
"Came around 4pm on Thursday and waited only 5 minutes. The staff is really friendly. Location is really crowded, especially the bathroom.. But on to the food review

Ramen was so flavorful and new since I've never had a chicken broth ramen before. The pork was amazing and melted in your mouth. And the noodles! So good. Only downfall was that I felt super sick afterwards.. I think it was the oil but I still enjoyed it!

Overall, I think it's better than Ippudo but not better than ramen dojo in Cali.",1.0
"If there was  a lower rating I definitely would have chosen it. One it took twenty minutes in a not packed night to get a waiter to come to us. Second drinks were watered down. Third the appetizers were cold, not room temperature cold but I just came out of freezer cold. Fourth, my entrée Bruschetta chicken pasta was disgusting, A lot of sauce little pasta I suspect to cover part of the burnt chicken and undercooked chicken. I could not eat it my health and taste buds would not allow it. I forgot to mention entrees took almost 45 minutes. The rest of my group ordered hamburger and chicken breasts (patties) sandwiches. My son felt sick. The waiters were nice. The manager uncaring and when I tried to speak to him about the issues completely zoned out during conversation like he had something better to do. I am sorry I thought  you were getting paid to Manage. Pardon me I was wrong. The Manager stated that he would removed appetizer and my entrée. He did take it off our bill and then they inflated the price of everything else we ordered. The dummy did not realized that we realized. Silly boy tricks are for kids. I'm contacting the Corporate Office as a Ship is as strong as its Captain. This ship needs to sink. I asked the Manager if this was part of the franchise run and owned by Corporate or privately owned. He declared it was run and owned by Corporate.",1.0
"Seriously? How does this place have three stars?  We live in the area and decided to pop in last night for dinner.  I was SO disappointed and ended up getting sick when we got home.

Chips and salsa were both cold, chips were slightly stale.

I got chicken fajitas - it was obvious that they had been made a while ago and reheated because it came out on a plate, not hot or sizzling and were just bleh. 

The margaritas are an amazing deal.... Until you get them and realize they are the mix margs, so FULL of sugar and taste like a mix from the store.

My husbands enchiladas had chicken that was dry and he only ate half but just because he was hungry.

One of the worst meals I've had in a while. Got home and felt so sick.  No thanks not again.",1.0
I don't think the food are safe. I ate here twice and felt sick both times. Will never visit again.,1.0
"Was great Chinese food but I believe they were recently bought and changed their name to ""Asia Express"" and must have a new chef, management, etc. Reading the same comment from some others reviewers, it is the worst Chinese food we have ever had after ordering from them since 2011. On our last experience ordered fried dumplings, sesame chicken and it was worse than dreadful. Actually the wife threw her food away and felt sick. Will not order again from them. Very sad due to recent changes. Used to be incredible and all visiting family members used to say wow this is great Chinese food.",1.0
"I got food poisoning from eating two slices of Barbeque Chicken Pizza from this place!!! All week, I had been vomiting and had major headaches and stomach pains. It was so bad that I had to cancel my Halloween plans because I was feeling so sick. How terrible! Someone needs to look into this!",1.0
"Bad Sunday night decision. I love Peruvian food and was excited to try more Peruvian places in Astoria. Although this place is a whole in the wall with pretty terrible location we decided to try it - total fail!

The ceviche was terrible! I felt sick after eating some of it. The quality of the fish was really bad and the it was served in diluted lemon juice. My boyfriend ordered the seafood in Peruvian sauce. Not as terrible as the ceviche but a flat dish in terms of flavor of the sauce and the seafood. 

The restaurant although decently spacious, does not have much setting for parties of two, the only tables for parties of 2 were right next to the door or next to the bathroom. Although the majority of the restaurant was empty they wouldn't let us sit elsewhere. 

When in doubt do not get the seafood here I spent all night feeling ill.",1.0
"Going by just the prices I came to this restaurant. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, what a mistake I went back home with more than I bargained for. I was sick throwing up and had a upset stomach for days after eating from here. Avoid this place at all cost.",1.0
"Be very careful if you have any food allergy or dietary restrictions before eating here as you will likely be misinformed.  Asked waiter whether or not certain ingredients were in a dish and was assured they were not.  After eating a few bites and realizing that the dish did contain the ingredient I could not have, I was very upset to say the least.  Not to mention someone from our party felt very sick the next morning from their meal.",1.0
"Please look for another restaurant in this terninal. This Panda express looks ok and the food taste was ok as well, but I got really sick a few hours later (severe diarrhea), very likely from this place. My friend eats vegetarian which was absolutely no option, she got offered to taje the shrimps. The employees just do not know what they are doing.",1.0
"Not only was it the WORST burger I've ever had I got food poisoning on top of it! I live in the hood and was craving a burger last Saturday night so I thought of stopping by. It was early, around 6:00 so I figured we'd be able to get a table right away...well I thought wrong. Every tourist and b&t family within a 2 miles radius is waiting for a table at 5 Napkin at 6:00 on a Saturday, reason #759 why to stay far away from this place. We were told it would be about 25 minutes so we sat at the bar to wait. We ordered two manhattans which were ok and to their credit, the wait really was only 20-25 minutes. This place is a complete zoo! Our waiter was perfectly fine, actually I would say pretty good given the mayhem going on. We ordered the kale salad, which was the only decent thing we had all night. A bottle of Crozes-Hermitage, which was fine, the classic burger which I ordered medium rare and it came medium well and a lamb burger that was so gamey I could smell it coming. On the classic burger the dollop of ""cheese"" on top looked like velveetta, the patty was burnt on the outside with absolutely zero flavor on the inside. I took one bite of my bf's lamb burger and was like, ""it's all yours"". The fries were even cold. This was easily the worst meal I've had yet in NYC...do yourselves a favor and skip this place!",1.0
"Another great burger spot where yet again I went with the burger that featured a fried egg (Texas burger).  Not quite as good as the Black Iron, or as messy, but the wait staff here is a riot.  They have a milkshake called the ""Michael Jackson"" and when we asked ""why that name?"" the waitress said, ""because it's half black, half white.""  Hilarious.  Definitely a dive but a great place to stop after a long day of Beekman beers or 13th Step sports.

I recently went back and felt SUPER sick after eating my burger... so I lowered to a 3.",1.0
"None of us will be returning.

Six of us last night were in need of a place with good drinks and good food.  Pitch & Fork is right near my apartment, and I have walked past it many times on my home from work, and I've always seen people inside and eating on the sidewalk.  Since it always seemed busy, I was happy with the group's consensus to head over there for a late dinner.

We arrived around 10pm, and while there was a table outside with two people eating, no one was in the restaurant itself.  Rather than taking it as a sign, we just assumed it was late.

Our service was slow and unhelpful.  Some of my friends were interested in the Pitch & Fork cocktail, but wanted to know what Campari tasted like, and our waiter assured them it was ""a little bitter, but mostly sweet.""  He also mentioned the Soup of the Day, describing it ONLY as ""Our special soup of the day is Potato and Leek.""  When one of my friends asked for the salmon and he asked how it should be cooked, he said ""order it medium, that way it is perfectly cooked throughout.""

Oh, no sir, you were made of lies.  1 - The cocktail was awful.  I actually like sour and bitter tastes and even when I tried one of my friends', it ONLY tasted bitter.  The flavors of the gin, and even sickly sweet maraschino cherries should have been present but were not at all.  2 - What my server didn't mention AT ALL was the soup was served cold.  I would not have ordered it had I known, and all he said was, ""Oh, yeah I didn't mention that.""  Since I opted to not have my soup thrown into a microwave, I tried to make the best of it.  3 - My friend's salmon was still raw in the middle.

Perhaps my favorite moment was the arrival of a burger my friend and her boyfriend were splitting.  They had ordered it without bacon and without onions.  Our waiter repeated that back to them twice: ""So you just want bun burger and cheese?"" - and yet it came to the table without a bun, just a sad little cheese patty on the plate.

And within three hours of eating here, I threw up.  Food poisoning AND awful service on a night with one other table? No thanks.  We should have gone to the Writing Room instead.",1.0
"This place was recommended to us so we decided to give it a try.  Very nice inside, good waiters, nice menu.  My steak was very tough, and it was either the steak or the salad that gave me food poisoning. I don't necessarily fault them for that as it can happen anywhere but it wasn't cheap and due to the toughness of the steak and the price I, in good conscience, cannot recommend it.",1.0
"Never eat here! Stopped here for dinner with my boyfriend after several recommendations and ended up with a terrible experience and FOOD POISONING.

My bf got the lasagna, and I got the veal osso buco. The manager/owner Joey was very friendly, and the house Chianti was tasty. That's where any good experience ended.

The food arrived quickly - too quickly. Seven minutes of wait time isn't even enough to heat precooked food up in the microwave. The veal was tender, but exceptionally bland. The risotto was the worst I've ever had. It was soupy and flavorless. When we complained, Joey offered us some gnocchi, which was, if possible, worse. The pasta was overcooked, and the brownish sauce on top was unidentifiable. Topped off with some Kraft parmesan cheese, it was a plate full of nasty.

The lasagna was steaming hot. The noodles were overcooked. The cheese on top was barely melted, however, and the meat and sauce combination, tasted mediocre and came with a side of thirty six hours of gastrointestinal upset.

The only other positive comment I have, is that they didn't charge extra for the food poisoning.",1.0

"i'm updating my review to add 2 stars instead of one only because one of the owners emailed me to apologize for my numerous disappointing  visits and food poisoning.

No need to bother with details, but to say the least, my day off from work was spent being ill to the point where I could barely get out of bed.

"Briefly: nice industrial environment / HORRIBLE coffee!!!

I liked the spacious interior with industrial look.
However, the coffee was absolutely terrible!

I got a decaf coffee that was just warm and tasted bad/weird.
My gf got an iced americano that tasted as if u stirred some coffee into cold water - she had a sip or two and through the rest in the garbage.

"If you have a food allergy, AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
I have a severe dairy allergy, and am vegan, so I kindly asked the waitress what my options were. I ordered a veggie enchilada dish minus the cheese and sour cream, and was told everything else was vegan friendly. I also made sure to let her know cross-contamination would be an issue, and she assured me I could be accommodated. My entree was pretty bland, veggies were soggy and under seasoned, and moments after I finished my meal I found myself running to the restroom and vomiting my brains out for the next 10 minutes. I can't be sure it had something to do with my allergy (I usually can taste if there's something I can't be eating), but seeing as no one else in my group got sick, I'm going to assume they blatantly ignored my allergy. Obviously will never go back.",1.0

Wait - very excessive - like greater than 20 minutes which is nuts

I lived in chelsea for 6 years. tried this for the first time last night. I was recommended the baby shark arepas when I asked if they had fish arepas.

The fact that I waited close to half an hour for one take out arepa should have alerted me that something weird was going on.

"I have eaten from here (delivery) a number of times and it's typically hit or miss.

They do a tasty steak burger... when it's done right. One order the brioche bun was great... another time I ordered it the multigrain bun was stale.

The regular fries are delicious... when the delivery comes before they are cold. The curly fries are bad. They are shoe string curly fries. Very irregular and also dry. Maybe they'd be better were they not cold.  

The last delivery order I did took a long time and the food was cold when it got here. I still ate the burger, and then I felt sick. I'm thinking because the burger came up to room temp and sat for awhile. 

I ordered a black bean burger once, it was dry and fell apart.",1.0
"This restaurant went so downhill! Never going back! First of all the online menu is totally deceiving looks super inviting with all these great selections but the real menu is so limited and has nothing uniquely different.

I asked for lemon so that I can squeeze it over the shrimp to kill off the intense fishy-ness but it didn't seem to make a difference. Felt a pain in my stomach, then the bill was super high!!!!!!!!

"After a long day walking around the city and my cell phone about to die, my friends and I decided to check this place WITHOUT reading reviews (something I never do).  That being said, this place had good reviews (very surprising now looking back) so I probably would have gone in anyhow.  

First and foremost, it was overpriced.  I know it's NYC, but you can get amazing Italian for far less than what they charged.  Unfortunately, the price was not the most offensive part.  I ordered the Fusilli and my friend ordered the Gnocci.  Both of us immediately spit out our food.  The taste was so salty it was as if the chef dumped an entire shaker of salt on the food.  Our other friends' dishes tasted fine, so someone made a mistake in the back and did not taste the food before serving it.   I NEVER send food back because it usually doesn't help your case.  I simply could not eat the food and was quite hungry.  As a result, they gave me the Tagliolini ($19 for pasta with red sauce...) instead.  Luckily, that did not have the same salt issue.  When the bill came they charged both my friend and I for our original dishes.  We asked if they could at least adjust for the basic pasta dishes we ate.  The server sent over someone who I would assume is the manager and after arguing and being quite rude he took both off the bill.  

Last, adding insult to injury, as predicted sending the food back resulted in me getting what I can assume was mild food poisoning the rest of the night.  Awesome.  Thanks!",1.0

Very shortly after I ate the burrito, I began to vomit violently, experience the worst stomach cramps of my life and suffer other unpleasant symptoms of what was the result of clearly tainted meat.

"My friends and I decided to get brunch last week and this place got a pretty good rating on Yelp so we decided to come here. We were a bunch of hungry hippos trying to find this place and we got lost because the outside of this place is planks of wood, lol. 
Anyway, a waitress st the counter who were in the middle of chatting with other coworkers in Japanese looked at us and told us to sit wherever we'd like from the counter. There was only one other customer at that time. Waiting at our table for about 5 minutes or so, that waitress finally came over with the menu. Until then she was literally just chatting with her coworkers loudly in Japanese. My friends and I gave each other the ""wtf?"" look because we watched other customers being served by this waiter even though they walked in later than we did... I ordered this cold ramen noodle dish and my friends ordered the chicken meatballs with rice and this uhh, sashimi-don? Or whatever you call it in Japanese. And we also shared a banana and nutella croissant for dessert. There wasn't a wide variety of dishes to choose from and the food we ordered were all in very tiny portion. Let me also mention that I'm one of those people who never carries any cash in my wallet and this place only takes cash. So great... it was extremely inconvenient for people like me.
After I got home, I started feeling really sick and later realized I got food poison. I haven't had anything else that day and I had an early dinner the night before so it must have been from the stuff I ate at this restaurant. As I was doubting myself, I heard from my friends who went to this place with me that they also got food poison.
This was the worst dining experience of my life and I'm never coming back here again, obviously.",1.0
"While in NYC my friend had a list of places he MUST go to before leaving the big apple. 
We had known that P-Diddy sent his female musical protégés on a long hazing-like journey to get him some cheesecake from Juniors. It was that very degrading reality TV episode that not only stopped me from watching that show, but look at Puffy in a different light. Before our hike to Juniors, both of us had eaten the same food at a previous restaurant at the Empire State building and for dinner I wanted to try a pizza from Juliana's. Before bed, I ate pizza, and he ate cheesecake. During the middle of the night I heard this roaring sound coming from the bathroom. It was the sound of someone not just throwing up, but throwing up their GUTS!

I told him, ""I bet it was that cheesecake!"" He didn't want to admit it because not only had he heard so many good things about this place, but he also had ANOTHER piece saved for later calling his name! I made him throw it away and thought his food poisoning was over. He continued to get up at least 2 more times throughout the night to vomit!
I regret not calling them and complaining but we had a flight to catch and I just didn't want to deal with it. I'm probably the one person in the world that doesn't care for cheesecake and will probably indulge in it once a year-if that! I also don't doubt that this place has really good cheesecake, but all establishments mess up now and then. I really think the milk, butter, cream cheese, strawberries---or whatever it may have been was spoiled and caused him to be violently ill. It's sad...even though he got food poisoning he STILL didn't want to throw that cheesecake away. LOL",1.0
"Went here for dinner last week and I got sick. I ordered the lobster roll. Not sure if it was that and the mixture of wine that I got combining together to create the storm of a stomach ache I got after or if it was something else. Also the fries, I wanted to be wowed by the fries...but I just wasn't. Parmesan, garlic, honey-butter, paprika...something! Too bad, really looked forward to this place.",1.0
"My boyfriend's friend wanted to celebrate his birthday here and had made reservations for several people, but when we arrived, they said our party was too large and that the hostess taking the reservation was new as they didn't take reservations of our size and past a certain time. Well, no worries, I understand that people make mistakes first time on the job, and we ended up getting seated anyways. 

I made the mistake of ordering the veggie burger with yuca fries and got horrible food poisoning later that night that confined me to a bed for a week. No thanks. Won't be back.",1.0
Have been going here for breakfast wraps as a loyal customer and have been ok up until today. Went for a greek wrap this morning and within 15 mins of finishing my wrap I ran to the bathroom and have had FOOD POISONING all. day.

Really  disgusting when u think about it ...",1.0
"The restaurant looks like your regular outdated diner. Small and narrow with varying sizes of booths and waiters who don't care about your existence.

"So overhyped.

Compared to In N Out's animal fries, the cheese fries were abysmal, and the shake, a chocolate malt which arrived without the malt, was so thick that I felt sick within 10m.

"It's only my love of the pho that keeps me from downgrading it substantially. 

Pluses-the pho is great and plentiful.  the broth is consistently the best I've gotten in NYC. My experiences with other dishes is not as favorable. it's also cheap.

negative - the rice crepe dish seems to have downhill. this is a great, hard-to-find specialty.

super negative - so the last time I went my party all put down a lot of cash each, expecting to get our $50 or so in change after a 20% tip back. Unfortunately that didn't happen and after about 45 minutes, the manager was able to check the security cameras and verify that yes, we gave the waiter an overabundance of cash. The waiter was grossly inept (and must have taken the cash and finished his shift). I've gone here 20+ times and that was a first. The manager apologized, but this could have really soured the mood. I'm not sure my friends will return, sadly.

other super negative - there's a possibility I got food poisoning once....
the bathrooms can be not that great.
yet, I return. I expect certain trade-offs with the low price point so...at least I know what to look out for? I'm a sucker for great and consistent pho (for New York).",1.0

I came here with friends and the food was delicious however it did not compensate for the food poisoning I got. I had the daily special meatball (sausage and peppers) on a hero with provolone cheese. I am very disappointed because like I said I did enjoy the food and would have wanted to come back and try out other options on the menu. Now I don't ever want to see a meatball again in my life. The countless hours I've spent on the toilet make me regret ever walking past this place.,1.0
"I agree with a Vivian F. I've been to Soba-ya many times over the past years, and always thought the the food was delicious - but the last two times I've eaten there for lunch on the weekdays I've experienced symptoms of mild food poisoning. The first time this happened (about 6 months ago), I thought it couldn't possibly be from this restaurant, it's a popular spot and doesn't look dicey - but just yesterday I ordered almost the same thing (the tempura rice bowl vs mini set) and six hours later, while I was at work and before I ate anything else, the same thing happened again. I'm mad at Soba-ya for poisoning me, and I'm mad at myself for going back despite my previous incident.",1.0
"I have to give Jean-Georges a bad review, even tho the food was good and the staff excellent. I had a meal on October 27th that cost me nearly $400 (for two). That night I came down with food poisoning and couldn't eat for a day. 

I considered the food I had that day and realized that the culprit was likely the raw tuna or salmon ""ribbons"" I had, so I sent them a comment through their website, leaving my name, phone number, and email. I did not ask for anything but suggested they consider their preparation of this, actually delicious, dish. 

I don't expect any reimbursement, because they cannot know if I'm lying, but I did expect some response, at least a simple ""We'll redouble our efforts in this area.""

Without that, I have to say, Avoid this place. The expense is great, and if something wrong is discovered after you pay they do not care.",1.0
"Fast delivery by a friendly deliveryman, but the food wasn't good and it gave me terrible food poisoning. The same night I ate the food, I became terribly ill a few hours later. It was definitely the food from this restaurant b/c it was the only thing I'd eaten that day. After recovering, I decided to look into their health dept records and found that they used to get B and C ratings under a different name but recently changed the name of their restaurant to ""New Wing Gong"" under which they have an A rating. Clearly, they are slipping back into to their unclean ways and it won't be long until they change their name again to hide their health dept rating.",1.0
"I had a good time here. I did.


My boyfriend and I got the short ribs which were divine!!!


We also may or may not have gotten 2 watermelon Sojus. Because, why not? Memorial Day what?!


However, I must warn you, he and I suffered from food poisoning the next day. And now, it could've been from the copious amount of watermelon juice in combo soju, or it could've been the meat/appetizers.

We're not 100%, however, I had such a good time there that I'm willing to go back and try it again.


Plus, their SEAFOOD looked INCREDIBLY!! (I probably shouldn't be saying that since I had food poisoning, but the restaurant has numerous 4-5 stars for a reason!)",1.0
"It's currently 1:55am as I'm writing this, having just finished cleaning up the apartment floor from the food poisoning my girlfriend got after eating at the Smith earlier today/yesterday. She ordered the BLT with fried egg at brunch. 

Fair or unfair to The Smith, as they serve hundreds of meals a day, I felt the obligation to warn others of this happening there and hopefully make the restaurant aware that they need to step up their quality control game.

So, if you're looking for a risk-free meal, I'd look elsewhere.  Why take the chance with so many other great places in the area?",1.0
"Food poisoning.

That's the main reason why I'm not going back here anymore. Got it about 2 weeks ago and I'm 99% positive it was from something I ate here. I was sick for about 4 days, thanks!

"My personal experience:

Although many of my friends are having a good experience with Go Organic NYC, I on my end am quite disappointed. 

1. The first food delivery was amazing. The fruits and veggies were really fresh and big! But all the following deliveries were far from being as good. Some veggies were almost rotten. (Could it be a sales strategy - to ""seduce"" the client on the first delivery?)

2. I got food poisoning from either their lettuce or their cucumbers.

3. I asked them to come pick up the food delivery box, and they did not come. In fact, I have asked six times (each time speaking to Brian) and they still did not pass by.

So it's either I'm unlucky, or they may have lowered their standards.",1.0
"I would give this place 4 stars if I were reviewing it as a bar -- unfortunately I got food poisoning from their food which is why I gave it two stars.

This place is crap. Seems very dirty. The owner tried to start a fight with me for no good reason. It seems like a very low class place for this neighborhood.

It upsets me because for over 20 years I've loved this place and it's not what it used to be.

I was never able to finish my dish because it always sucked. Then again, what can you expect? 
But anyways, if your trying to get a quick detox, then eat up! My boyfriend learned to never eat a salad from places like this. One of my friends got food poisoning from eating here as well. Therefore, I'll just stick to the bar and eat else where before or after.",1.0
"The four stars are for their happy hour only - I can't speak about their actual dining room. I've been trying to come here for 8 years!! But hubby came here for a business function and got food poisoning awhile ago and refused to return. I finally made plans with a girlfriend to come on a Thursday after work where we sat at the bar and had the New England clam chowder, Manhattan clam chowder, raw oysters and razor back clams, and oyster sliders. They serve complimentary pretzels, peanuts, and oyster crackers at the bar (don't be fooled by the individual packaging. Help yourself!) The soups were good, the oysters better than average (and a great price at $1.25/each for a LARGE oyster), but my favorite was the oyster sliders! They were like 2 mini oyster po-boys with about 3 breaded and deep fried oysters in each slider. DELICIOUS. You MUST get this.

Fun, bustling environment. We were able to sit at the bar for about an hour and catch up over delicious food in an iconic restaurant. It also doesn't hurt that it's gotta be one of the most convenient places to meet up since it's in Grand Central! Great place to go, I'm going to recommend it to all my out-of-town visitors!",1.0

prices aside, the food is awful. my boyfriend got food poisoning after eating here. i ordered regular pork dumplings - a staple in chinese cuisine - and it was nasty, possibly the worst dumpling i've ever eaten. the skin was thick and chewy, the meat wasn't very flavorful, and it basically just tasted like i was eating dough dipped in soy sauce. i've had a lot of restaurant dumplings as well as authentic, homemade chinese dumplings, but these didn't make the cut at all. awful.",1.0
"I came here for Father's Day the service was good and so was the atmosphere the food not so the mashed potatoes taste like if it came from the box variety aka just ass milk and butter. 
I got the Hawaiian rib eye half the steak was fatty even though I asked for it not to be fatty. The side of potato shoe string fried were so salty the waiter did not even charge us for it. The breaded shrimp my wife ordered were a little under cooked and extra chewy. After spending about 150$ gratuity included I was highly disappointed. Not even a hour after leaving he place I felt sick to my stomach and ended up throwing up and having diarrhea. It made me sad being that everybody recommended this restaurant to us and what made it worst was that it was Father's Day since I got sick my wife felt bad for bringing me here only reason i am giving 3 stars is because of the service I'm a steak and potato type of guy and have never felt this way after a meal and I've been to alot of places around the city this is actually my first review that's how bad the food was smh sorry hillstone step it up.hope this helps somebody",1.0
"I visited Rana with my boyfriend last night after Green Table was unexpected closed and we were craving Italian. I ordered the squid ink pasta with the lobster sauce, and my boyfriend ordered the bolognese. Both pastas came after a long wait, and were severely undercooked, hard and chewy...which is really inexcusable for a 'world-renowned pasta chef.' Even my lobster lost most of its tenderness and was rubbery (similar to faux crab). It was an incredibly disappointing meal, especially for the price, and I only had a few bites before my stomach felt sick. There are so many great Italian restaurants in New York, so why pay extra for subpar-to-horrible food?",1.0

I know what these guys do is amazing, but I am really concerned about eating there again. I am still in bed not feeling quite right. I guess that my question is : how well do they wash the produce? I so seldom get food poisoning and one would think
from an almost all vegetarian place that it was less likely? Help!!!",1.0

We ordered a salad, mixed mezze, the calamari appetizer and the lamb appetizer. He Added on an extra vegetable dish that we didn't order, then went of for the night, leaving no one to dispute this with.
The salad and the mezze (hummus,tazziki,eggplant) were fine, but the calamari and the lamb were way more than awful. Both were barely warm and had obviously been sitting out for hours. The calamari (which I declined to even taste as it looked so old) gave my wife food poisoning.

"I live near Cilantro and eat here frequently. It upsets me that I have to 1 star this review but feel it necessary to complain about my last experience. I ate here with my husband last night and while the service was perfectly fine (as it usually is) the food was awful. I ordered an enchilada with the cheese not properly melted so I picked most of it off. But the real reason for the review is while my husband and I were eating the chips and guacamole, he ate/then spit out something that was not a chip but appeared to be an old piece of fish or chicken fried. We brought it to our servers attention and he immediately told a manager who then informed us it was an old chicken wing that had been fried in the same space the tortilla chips were. Either way, my husband was up all night with food poisoning and still can not keep anything down because of the food he ate. Again-- we love this restaurant and eat here often but the quality of the food was completely unacceptable last night that we may never come back.",1.0
This is the last straw. I ordered a large ribs tips and 3/4 were spoiled meat. My coworkers and myself had a horrible lunch. U could taste how bad the meat was I just pray I don't get food poisoning. This is unacceptable -capitalism at its best: money over health.,1.0

My boyfriend had the fish and chips, which ended up being a disastrous choice.

In all seriousness, this is a great place. The patrons are quiet, so you can relax and get some work done. There's plenty of seating and power plugs. But the best is all the delicious teas.

I am a tea snob and the majority of teas I get are from Teavana. You can get them to brew you a cup in the store or you can buy some tea as well as specialized tea-making tools and mugs to take home. They even have tea smoothies and tea espresso drinks, not to mention tea cookies, tea salads, tea sandwiches, etc. I'd be careful when ordering food, though.

Definitely felt like I would get a heart attack finishing it and it wasn't even a big sandwich. It was quite tasteless. It was all cheese...granted that's the majority of it.

I had empanadas de carne (beef) and they werent too bad. My friend had cheese ones and they were super greasy. Their tostones were amazing.

Cost overall- this place is really affordable, very cheap. Also, it is a very nice setting they decorated well. 

Why three stars than!? MY FRIEND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE GOT FOOD POISONING. She was throwing up among other things within an hour after we ate for the next 24 hours. She never gets sick off of food, so this was a shock.

"I'm giving Kambi a three star rating 'cos I'm almost 100% certain that they were the reason why I became gravely ill yesterday evening. Disaster struck about an hour or two after I stopped in and ate a radish salad and an order of pork gyoza. If anyone else reading this review also contracted some sort of food-borne illness yesterday (9/3/14), please let me know. 

Aside from getting sick, everything was great. I'm a longtime fan of their sister restaurant Minca and Kambi's food was just as good (well, on the surface level anyway :| ). The service was attentive and cordial and I had my genmaicha tea refilled a few times without having to ask. That's something that never happens at Minca even when it's empty. 

Nevertheless, whether or not it was Kambi that gave me food poisoning, the experience scared me enough that I'm not sure I'd ever go back.

With all the new restaurant opening in the area, Docklands is failing terribly and will never get my business again. Waste of my money and I'm sick on top of it!!!",1.0
"If I could give this place no stars I would.  First off, I have lived in this area most of my life, since i'm a kid.  This place has always been mostly on a downturn, except when they really start losing customers or when someone gets sick I guess.  The bathrooms are atrocious.  One toilet actually faces the wall.  My sister has witnessed employees/management fighting in front of customers.  I havent eaten here in ages simply because the quality is not good.  My mom comes here fairly often with a friend for coffee and lunch (I dont know why) and this past weekend got very sick from food poisoning there.  Please go a little out of your way and go somewhere else.  You'll thank me.",1.0
"I would have given it no or minus stars if I could have.  I have been going to Nonno's for years, and was always the first to recommend them to anyone,  The food was consistently really great, and the staff and owner, Tommy were always really friendly.  It was a nice,homey neighborhood restaurant.  Well, unfortunately, another great place bites the dust.  I would have written this sooner, but for the last couple of days I have been getting over food poisoning, yes, FROM NONNO'S!  THIS IS NOT THE SAME NONNO'S.  I went in Tuesday night (7/14/15) and ordered a simple meal, as I have been doing for years - chicken cutlet milanese with ziti.  The girl at the front kept saying bolognese (which I had no idea what that even was) and I kept saying milanese, and one of the other guys had to tell her - milanese - means no cheese!  Anyway, I finally get my order and another young guy at the counter calls out ""chicken bolognese"" and I again repeat just to be sure - MILANESE RIGHT? Yeah right he says.  I take it home and see the ticket and it says sure enough BOLOGNESE, At which point I open it and look and say to myself, ""you've got to be kidding"".  Go ahead and drive back and walk in and they look at me and I say very nicely that they got my order wrong and said I had asked 3 times for chicken cutlet milanese - a simple chicken cutlet, with sauce, and ziti. What I got was a whole different thing - chopped up pieces of chicken, no clue how it was spiced, in some kind of red sauce apparently made with cream with I would never have, on top of some ziti.  I was made to feel like I was stupid and that the mistake was mine,  Most places are gracious and said they're sorry and they will get you what you wanted.  They were so nasty about it, and at that point I should just asked for my money back, but went ahead and let them make my ""correct"" order. No one said one thing to me like, ""We're sorry."", or ""let's check to see if your new meal was really cheaper than the meal you origially paid for.""  Nope - I got a lousy little can of ginger ale - wow - for free!! and they handed me the food like they couldn't wait to get rid of me.  I got back home and started to eat some of my dinner, It wasn't like it was terrible but as I was eating something was definitely off, so I stopped eating.  As the night went on I wasn't feeling bad but again something was off.  I wish I would have trusted my instinct about the people and the food.  By the middle of the night, I WAS SO SICK - I could spell it out, but well, use your imagination, and leave it at that!! Now to top it off, I have to deal with the pain that was caused in my chest from pulled muscels, when I was, well, again use your imagination.  So, I started asking around, and, now it all makes sense.  I wish I would known before I went in that night, but I have since learned that Tommy isn't the owner anymore, there is a new owner, The lovely woman who was the waitress was fired, The new people behind the counter don't know what the hell they are doing, are so nasty, and, although I can't accuse anyone, wouldn't put it passed someone saying, "" Wrong order? We'll show her wrong order!""  This is especially since I also heard, that this new owner is a piece of work -not only is he probably going to run Nonno's into the ground, he is supposedly suing Tommy because he doesn't have any business (customers).  DUH - ya think?! let's see nasty people, food poisoning....hmm, guess it doesn't have to take a brain surgeon to figure that one out!  Do I even have to say I SURE AS HELL WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN NONNO'S AGAIN?!",1.0
"Fifth time is not the charm. It is really something when you come to a place with money in hand and they go out of their way to make you regret it. I can live with lazy, a little rude or apathetic but not being singled out. My friend and I were there and our server was very nice and the food tasted nice. It was 1 and a half hours after we left thinking all is going well when she got sick. She could barely walk and I am not strong enough to carry her. She had to sit on the sidewalk for awhile. She vomited many times. She was repeating that her stomach hurts bad. I knew it was food poisoning. I had that a few times from other places. I don't know what exactly caused it so I will list everything she ate there. She had the bread with the spread, salmon with the black risotto and mushrooms, and a brownie sundae dessert with no nuts. I ate the exact same thing and I was fine. I don't know if the cause was malice or negligence but experienced chefs should know when something is wrong and throw it out and not serve it.",1.0
"I don't know what happened to this place. I used to go here almost every week and was always satisfied. But something happened and now it's like a totally different restaurant. Their noodles are soggy and food is not hot and the last time I ate there the food tasted different and I'm almost positive that's where I got the food poisoning from. But I loved this place and gave it another tutu but the last time I went there, we went in 10 minutes before they opened (I know they hate it, I used to wait tables too), so when they told us to wait 10 minutes till they set up everything, we said thank you for let us in and gladly waited. 35 minutes later we were still waiting and nobody gave us water or menu. We walked out and they saw us but didn't say anything. Never ever going back here.",1.0
"Two words: Food poisoning. Went to this place last week everyone said this place was ""SOO cool"" and that they made you wait 2 hours but is ""totally worth it."" Well after living in the neighborhood for 5 years I finally went. I remember my first thought when i walked in, ""hipster nonsense"". But alright I was there i was going to give it a try. So I sat down and ordered  a bunch of things. I ordered a drink from their extremely limited wine list. The food was decent the fried rice was good but its a chinese restaurant.. it should be. What followed was what garnered this place 1 star. I was sick throwing up for the next 24 hours and then the place was SHUT DOWN by the board of health 5 days later for 70 violations including RAT FECES in the food prep areas. I could not be more disgusted. I cannot tell you how upset I am that I tried this place. I hope this place stays closed and I will personally do everything in my power to make sure this is the case.",1.0
I work near the area and craved sushi one day so I ordered a simple roll.  Price was fair and it was tasty. I am very picky as to where I order food by the way. That was my first experience Which  was good but the second time I ordered from here I got food poisoning. I ordered the same sushi and some noodles and within hours I was ill. Never again.   I should been more careful especially since the restaurant had an unpleasant smell and no ac during the hot summer day. Never again will I get food from here.,1.0
My husband and I went to Lenny last night thinking that the food was going to be good. Everyone we now talks about how great the food is but was very disappointed. The entrees we order came to us cold and my shrimp scampi was very very lemony. So my husband tasted it and he say the shrimps were bad. We asked for the check and left. It was not worth telling the manager because it looks like he doesn't care about the clients that go there. When I got home was been throwing up all of last night and most of the day. It looks like I got food poisoning from Lenny's.,1.0
"If you can, by all means avoid the steak. I got food poisoning after eating it and spent the following day in bed. $11 totally wasted. That's what I get for drunk munchies. But seriously avoid at all costs. The Mac and Cheese empanada is ok, but incredibly bland.

I don't plan on going back and I would urge you not to waste your money here, even if it's on a $2 empanada.",1.0
"Doesn't deserve even 1 star. I ate here the day before New Year's Eve and ordered the 3 course meal thing at lunchtime which consisted of onion rings, the cheeseburger and fries and the blueberry pie.
The onion rings were absolutely disgusting, swimming in a puddle of oil at the bottom of the bowl and were very unpleasant to eat. 
To make matters worse, that night I began burping up the taste of the food I ate here, but thought nothing of it. As I was in New York for only a short time, I went out to Madame Tassauds that night. I didn't even get into the elevator without sweating up and throwing up multiple times in the bin. Then proceeding through the museum and throwing up in 2 more different bins...... Andrews coffee shop gave me food poisoning!!!! BEWARE!!
It took 2 full days to stop throwing up/dry wrenching as I couldn't even keep water down for more than 5 minutes - absolutely wrecking my New Year's Eve plans restricting me to my hotel room bed instead of Times Square as planned. 
Upon later reading some reviews on yelp I noticed that this establishment had not too long ago been shut down by the health department!!!

I would not recommend this place at all unless you wish to run the risk of food poisoning and extremely mediocre food! DISGUSTING!",1.0
"We really love this place. All the food they serve is really good. Anytime we want good food or bring our friends to a good place to eat, we come here. 
Although, our last visit makes me doubt coming back here again. 
My wife had the craving for sinigang so we came here. When we arrived no one really greeted us to sit us. We stood in the middle of the restaurant awkwardly for about a min or so. The servers saw us but too busy to sit us i guess. Finally a manager or someone who was in charge greets us and points to the table right by the next to the door. My wife is pregnant, It was around 28 degs outside that night and it gets very cold when the door opens. When we asked for a different table the person threw her hands up and said ""do whatever you want"" so we waited for another table. 
We finally sit. It took another 10 before our server comes and take our order. We ordered the garlic fried rice (very good, my favorite) laing, kare kare and my wife ordered the pork sinigang. 10-15 mins later a server comes to us and 3 dishes and ask if we ordered a pork sinigang and we said yes. He then places in on our table. After about 5 minutes my wife starts serving her self and fills her bowl then the servers comes and says ""excuse me, thats not your! Pour it back"" at this moment we were in a shock. I said ""we ordered the same pork sinigang"" he then the server says, yours will come later, i'll bring it later"" He then takes it away and serves it to a table across from us. Very very shocking.
The food was good and we were being taken care of someone else. He was nice and fast. 
However my wife who is pregnant got food poisoning from the pork sinigang. Thats the only dish i did not eat and i did not get sick.",1.0
"FOOD POISONING!  I met my friend who's a local of NY here.  She's never been to this location so we decided to try this one.  The wait was about 15 minutes, so not too bad.  We sat down and got a booth.  Server was friendly, efficient.  The restaurant is super loud and tough to chat in.  I got the spicy beef special ramen.  The today's special.  I guess they were trying to get rid of the spicy beef or something.  Don't get me wrong.  It was delicious when I was eating it.  I ate all of it.  My friends didn't order the same thing.  I was visiting from LA so we then went about our touristy things planned for the day.  Our first free day in NYC!  It struck me later on fast and furious and needless to say, I didn't enjoy the rest of my day.  They have another location near my hotel and if I didn't get food poisoning, I would have tried the other one, too.  Boo hoo.  I'm not afraid of ramen now, but I definitely would not trust a special of the day anymore at restaurants.",1.0
"First time at this restaurant today for lunch with co-workers. The lobster club sandwich gave me SEVERE food poisoning! I had to leave work and have been vomiting badly! Still feeling sick - 7 hours after lunch!  Called the manager and he said that the only thing they can do is lunch on the restaurant next time and after my further complaining said they would refund my portion of the lunch today.  Really it wasn't the refund I was looking for to be honest as no refund can redeem this, but their willingness to recognize the problem, sound empathetic and offer some solution.  He sounded defensive and visibly frustrated by the end of the call. Asked him to explain how they r going to prevent this from happening to other people and they said if it was a bad batch they would throw it out. I told him - there is no IF... Also his major response to this was that they sell a lot of lobster sandwiches  and never had this issue, bla-bla. Again last thing I want to hear when I have been vomiting the whole day and have a business trip tomorrow I may need to cancel.  Trust me - the problem is not me - I have no food allergies and don't even remember when the last time I had food poisoning was.

"My boyfriend and I were shopping in Flushing today and wanted a quick, cheap, no-frills lunch and this looked promising. We love Asian food! We're in the epicenter of Asian food in New York City! What could go wrong?

A lot, apparently. When we were seated we received forks and spoons. Looking around, everyone else had chopsticks. That seemed a little rude of the waiter, and when I asked for chopsticks he seemed surprised. 

The food took ages to come out compared to the food at other tables. We had ordered noodle soups and a platter of appetizers, which seemed comparable to what was going to other tables. Yet a guy was seated at a table nearby after we were seated, ordered, received his meal, completed it, and was paying just as our soups came out (which came out before the appetizers).

The food wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't interesting or very good. My boyfriend's green curry soup was super oily but tasted okay. My Tom yum soup wasn't anything to write home about. The appetizers were all pretty meh as well; the chicken in the chicken satay was a little too pink for my liking. 

The meal was surprisingly pricey. The bill was almost $40, when I'm used to paying maybe $25 on two people in this area. 

The most unfortunate part of this entire endeavor was the epic food poisoning I got. I started feeling sick about two hours after eating (of course I was just getting on the 7 train as this was happening) and was sick all afternoon. I guess it was the pink chicken or something in my soup since my boyfriend didn't have any issues besides some intense gas. 

I'm sure there are a zillion better places to eat in Flushing if you want some noodle soup. Don't go here.",1.0
Currently have food poisoning due to something I ate here (fried wontons or shrimp lo mein). Three other girls at work have gotten sick from here too. Never again!,1.0
Stay far away!!!! I should have known better. This place messed up my order on two different occasions. I understand mistakes happen but the owner was unapologetic and plain rude both times when THEY messed up. So I went back for a third time and I have never been so sick in my life. Unless you want a wicked case of food poisoning with a side of disrespect stay far far away!,1.0
"I have been going to this place for many years but not often. The waitresses are incredibly rude. INCREDIBLY rude and they always look pissed. The food is ok. Yesterday I went there with my son and a friend with her son. The kids played outside on the grass while we ordered wine and edamame which we, the adults ate but the kids munched on as well. Right after we left one of the kids had to run to the bathroom with severe cramps. 2 hours later my own cramps set it and I almost exploded in my pants several times before reaching my apartment. When I finally got in I was in agony with severe cramping stomach pain and sat on the toilet all evening. Food poisoning happening between 1-6 hrs after eating is caused by staphylococcus aureus which is transmitted on the food from the staff picking their nose and not washing their hands. Disgusting. They really must hire new staff.",1.0
"I wanted to like this place-- and the food seemed kind of tasty until about 30 mins later. It was not food poisoning, but the oil they used for my pancake must have been old.

"I was super excited to try this restaurant for RW but then my boyfriend got food poisoned at 2am on Monday after having dinner here on Sunday night. We had the Maine diver scallops and Johnny cake for appetizers, both were really good, the scallops were cooked to perfection. I had the bass for my entree and it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Thai glazed short ribs, first let me just say that  the meat tasted like Oscar Mayer microwaved hot dog, yes the short ribs were tender but the taste and flavor were just like eating a hotdog, over seasoned and bad flavor. My boyfriend couldn't even finish the short ribs because the flavor was just too much, not what you expect from a high end restaurant. The desserts were both good and satisfying. We left the restaurant thinking ""ok most of the food was good, might come back"" until a few hours later I hear him vomiting and having an ""upset stomach"" which lasted all night and morning. It was a horrible night and all he could taste was the taste of the short ribs. I though the short ribs tasted funny, that's why I didn't bother to have more than a taste.",1.0
"I picked up pizza to go.  My husband ate the Barbaque Chicken pizza.  He and i ate the exact same thing for lunch at another restaurant but each had a different pizza for dinner.  He got food poisoning from that barbaque chicken pizza.  3 hours after he ate it, he threw up 7 times and have diarrhea.  I called the restaurant today to let them know.  Didn't expect anything, just wanted them to verify correct handling of chicken for future customers and the lady who answered the phone asked me what i expected her to do?  I said the right thing which is make sure the handling of chicken at your restaurant doesn't get anyone else sick.  She said she resented what i just said to her!  I said ok Meryl, them let me tell the health department and just filed a complaint.  I could have done that from the start but my object was not to be mean, it was just to try to make sure they knew they had a problem however when you get that sort of response, it forces you to do things you might not have done if the restaurant's customer service would have been appropriate.",1.0
"A friend and I finally made it to Bourbon and Vine on Friday evening for post-work drinks and appetizers. 

1) Loved the ambiance. Friend waited for me at the bar, and had a great time chatting with locals and the wait staff. When I arrived, we moved to seats in the back that were so comfy I could have slept there.

2) Friend had bourbon drinks and was entirely satisfied. I am more of a beer drinker and was pleasantly pleased with their selection of beers, along with the price ($6-$7 for Founders and River Horse).

3) Wait staff attentive and friendly. It was a busy Friday, but we were not made to feel rushed to leave. 

4) I ordered meatball appetizer. Serving size disappointingly small for the high price ($9 - $10 apps). Everything did taste delicious, BUT I GOT FOOD POISONING. Within 3 hours of eating the meatballs, I was 100% ill. Was down and out for the entirety of the weekend. Did not eat or drink anything else that could have given me food poisoning, I am 100% positive it was the meatballs. 

Would not go back to Bourbon and Vine. Great potential, but I cannot eat or drink anywhere that does not store/serve food in a sanitary fashion. There was obviously something wrong with the meatballs - bad meat, bad eggs, I don't know. Disgusted.",1.0

"Two of us arrived on a Saturday night with no reservations. The hostess politely told us it would be about an hour, took our phone number (for one of those cool text paging systems), and recommended a great craft beer bar down the street when we asked her for suggestions.

About 45 minutes later we got the ""your table is almost ready, hurry back"" text.

Everything about our meal was outstanding, from our server, to the bread, to the crab cakes, oysters (which our server helped us select), and the mussels. We also had multiple drinks (2 beers and 2 glasses of wine?) and our bill was right at $100 after tip.

This was our favorite food stop on our trip to NYC. We love Yelp for helping us discover it!

**4 stars instead of 5 because my husband came down with a really bad case of food poisoning a little over 24 hours later (not sure about the statute of limitations on seafood type food poisoning). We had been eating out all week, so its hard to say if it was maybe a bad mussel or something completely unrelated, but we share everything and I did not get sick (where as, you cannot share an oyster or mussel). 

Rest assured though, we would still make a return trip to Upstate if we were in the area again. Their service, prices, presentation and tastes were the perfect oyster bar experience for us.",1.0
"Just to cut to the chase here - I went here on a Wednesday and had the Massaman curry with beef.  I ended up with an aggressive bout of food poisoning that wiped me out for the rest of the week.  If that's not enough to put you off this place, continue reading.

I agree with the other reviewers - this place tries really hard to be trendy and club-like.  It's unnecessarily dark, with tacky brightly-colored decor throughout.  It's actually a pretty large restaurant, but, with the way the tiny tables and uncomfortable plastic chairs are set up, you're basically on top of the people sitting next to or around you, and it's really difficult to get up and move around.  It's also very loud - again, they try to play club music and create that type of atmosphere, but it just falls flat.

The service wasn't awful when I was there, but it wasn't very good either.  Our waiter was courteous, but it took a while to get our food and the check, even though it wasn't particularly crowded the night I went.

The food seemed good enough when I started eating it - the curry is flavorful, nicely spicy, a very large portion (though they're pretty skimpy on the rice), and the prices are affordable.  But I started to feel nauseous before I finished even half of it, and then it was all downhill (or, rather, down the toilet) from there.

Needless to say, I will never come back here.  There is much better Thai food at much less obnoxious establishments throughout the city.",1.0
"Horrible food poisoning from Lot 2:

It pains me to give this place one star but given my recent experience with Lot 2 I wouldn't feel right giving this restaurant more than 1 star. I had given a glowing review of this restaurant a few months ago, and it was actually one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The food was great, good service, great decor. However, last weekend I went to Lot 2 with my girlfriend and she ended up getting the worst food poisoning of her life from the dish she got. A few hours after dinner she vomited every 5 minutes for hours. I was on the verge of taking her to the hospital because it got so bad. I called up Lot 2 the next day and told them about my girlfriend's horrible experience because I definitely wanted to hear them out before giving this review. I was told by the chef that she was very sorry what had happened but she could only give us a complimentary salad next time we came in. I even sent Lot 2 an email about what happened and waited for a week but no response. I believe this is bad business on their part. We had been regular customers of Lot 2 for a few years, told all of our friends about this restaurant - really spread the word as you can see from my last review of this place - and all we were given from my girlfriend's severe food poisoning at Lot 2 was a free salad.",1.0
"So this place used to be called General Assembly. I had bad experience at this place during Restaurant Week last year when the waiter messed up my order and overcharged me for everything. To make the story short, my table was given a free meal.

Didn't forget about this incident, but forgot the name of the restaurant until I went this year for RW. They had completely renovated the place. 

Waitress was extremely nice and polite (so an extra star for that). However, definitely won't be coming back here for the food though. Here's what I ordered: 

Appetizer: Seared Scallop Sandwich
Entree: Everything-crusted Branzino 
Dessert:  Winter White Sundae

About four-five hours after the meal, I started to feel queasy. I was throwing up the whole night. Went to the doctor the next day because I was still gagging up water, told me I had food poisoning. 

I honestly think it was from the Branzino. When I took a bite in to it, it did taste a bit weird, but I thought it was from the sauce since it was extremely heavy (cream cheese).",1.0

Ate here yesterday around 6 p.m. started vomiting at 4:00 a.m. and I'm still going....stomach cramps diarrhea

"I'm writing this review with a still upset stomach from the gross salad I got from this place. 

The Harold deserves a 1 star if I've ever given one.

The food in general was completely unmemorable. Aside from sort of sketchy looking. And really overpriced. 

I got a salad which was $16 on the menu, but when the bill came, they charged me $22. It turns out the same salad is $16 on their lunch menu and $22 on the dinner menu. The manager was super insistent that there was no way I was given the lunch menu (apparently their servers never make mistakes). Fine, whatever jerk. Enjoy your 6 bucks.

I was ready to let it rest and just never come back. HOWEVER, to add insult to injury, right after I get home from dinner, I became violently sick with food poisoning. 

So yeah, do yourself a favor, avoid this place and go to one of the many awesome alternatives in the area.",1.0
"sadly, after over 20 years with this store I must concur about the food poisoning and the general deterioration  of the place since grace the owner brought in her  ""helper""   a few years ago.  I went into there  on Tuesday  21 april 2015 and received a very  mean and offputting  treatment.  I first ordered the pierogies  but as this helper checked me out he charged  10 USD and  I objected.  The pierogies had been 7 USD in 2014,  then raised a whole dollar  to 8 USD  later that year.  Now they wanted 10 USD  for the same pierogies.  When the inflation rate is supposedly about  3 percent  these huge price increases are  incredible.  The pierogie  store up the block recently went out of business, no doubt this is an attempt to take advantage of a monopolized market.   I objected and said I was not paying a  3 dollar increase in 2 years and to put them back.  Then a large  fight ensued that you would never get from the lovely owner grace.   This helper  said I was putting him in a bad mood from objecting to the constant  price increases.  I said,  I felt they should maintain the older prices for their loyal  few clients like me shopping there for 20 plus years.  As we did not see eye to eye this hostile  meanspirited  person and I agreed to disagree and I left with nothing.  I have to say , we live in a ultra  capitalist country and they can raise their prices as they see fit, but I can also object and  decide not to indulge their greed and not buy something without a vendor getting bent out of shape that I am objecting in the American way ! 
Now to the food poisoning:  yes, I did find every time I had their  gholumki that I did get  diarrhea and I mean every time !  I had to stop buying it.     

I can concur with other bouts of food  poisoning, loose bowels and such that I did have after eating these foods but I let it go as  I wanted to support one of the last  POlish  family style  stores  we have in this area.  It seems that since the owner brought in this helper that  the store has begun a long run  down.   For out of towners it might still b e a  thrill but for us locals : ""  we have seen better days ! ""  both in price and quality.  Over the last few years many once loyal customers to here  refuse to still shop there as this helper as taken over much more; the owner has receded into past history .   Its  a shame to see such a wonderful small store owner  pushed aside and affronted by her staff !?  

It is also well known in the HOOD  that this particular helper has ""different prices for different  clients""., not everything is listed and such  price  variation is  possible.  Its the talk of the neighbourhood about the price variations.  

No one is more of  a fan of this little store and we have  battled in the area to support this small little  store  but  it is going downhill  in many ways  now for many years  given the situation above.   The non stop price increases  caused by greed on the part of some elements of this store is most offputting to the locals but NOT to the  ""schickie mickies"" as we put it in German of the nouvau riche who have piled into this East Village area pushing rents  from about 1000 USD a month to way over  2000 USD  based on their high and parents' income help ! 

Years ago a buddy of mine  noted that many EV  stores no longer  would cater to the locals/middle classes  of the  EV and would raise their prices non stop to cater to the  ""1 percent""  who now  haunt the  EV . And so we see  in my most recent treatment in this store that  this has come true. !  

If you go to  Greenpoint  you can find these products  for half the price , even now.

I am familiar with the lease  this store has and other business expenses.  These high prices are caused by greed only and the desire to be a purveyor of high priced Polish items to only the nouveau riche of the area.   I strongly  urge you to enter this store ONLY if  the owner is present and attending the customers and  no one else.  She is  small hefty woman  with a gentle  smile.  It could well be that she is unaware of the uneven and mean treatment in pure greed that happens when she is absent.       Also do not buy the  gholumki under any circumstances.

The blintzes also went up in the same style about a year ago.  It went from 7 usd for the pack to 10 usd and then many in the HOOD  also did not buy anymore.  These huge greed  increases are NOT  motivated by the cost of labour or the cost of the ingredients  or by any  rent increases.  They are motivated by sheer  greed and avarice of certain parties within this store s  operation.  

For now I must  say I will not be back to this store under any circumstances unless I were to receive a apology  for the very unprofessional  behavior of one store employee against an old client, something which has been going on, so I hear, for many years, vis a  vis older clients  of this little store.   Given the uneven treatment  of clients and the problems in sanitation /price gouging a NO=GO",1.0
"Anyone who chooses to bypass New York's 23,000 superior restaurants to reserve a table at this clearly subpar, overpriced happy-hour mill can't be expecting much, and my friends and I were no exception. When we gave it a try for post-work drinks last night, though, the service was so outrageously poor that even our low, low expectations were jolted.

We would never have gone had two of us not won a $50 gift card at trivia a few weeks before. Before our initial visit, I called to make a reservation and the hostess asked, ""What time do you think you'll arrive?"" The question struck me as strange, but I answered, ""Between 8 and 8:30."" She seemed fine with that, but when we showed up at 8:15 we were told that since we were late, our table had been given up and we couldn't participate in trivia (which we paid for). We were forced to stand, then lean over the scoring table tucked near the bathroom. We still managed to nab second place, though, and planned to return (exactly on time) with co-workers to spend our gift card.

On our second visit, we were told that SantaCon had depleted Duke's beer supply, and we had to choose between Corona, Bud Light and Sam Adams. No prices were listed on the menus, except for their $12 ""big-ass cocktails."" We were offered a bucket of beer (the price was quoted to us as ""about $30; it was $37), or individual bottles of the choices quotes above (""not sure of the price""; $7 each). We balked at the prices, then ordered one round of drinks. We also got two orders of fries (greasy and under-seasoned) and one order of chips and salsa/guac (again, greasy and under-seasoned). All this came out to almost $100 for six people, but luckily, we had our gift card.

When we went to pay our bill, our server told us the gift card we'd given them had a balance of $0. Let me be clear: we were never given a physical card, just a printout with a barcode to be handed in with any bill. It's very obvious that had we used the gift card and had it had a balance of $0, I'd no longer be carrying it around in my wallet. They'd have kept it for themselves. When we insisted we won the gift card (clearly labeled to be worth $50) at trivia and that we'd never spent it, our server called her manager over.

And that's where the trouble starts. The manager approached with an overtly hostile attitude, demanding we pay the $50 balance of the gift card. We tried to explain calmly that there was a mistake and that we hadn't spent it, to which she responded with open aggression. She insisted we were wrong and cut us off multiple times, saying, ""Can you let me finish?"" as we tried to explain. We suggested she call the trivia company to figure out what's going on, and she refused, saying they wouldn't pick up the phone. We told her we wouldn't leave until she either figured out what was going on with the gift card or promised to reimburse us with a check. She said there was no way we could get a check, and the only thing she could do ""IF WE WERE RIGHT"" was issue us a second gift card. HA. We responded we'd never come back if we got another gift card, to which she said ""If you don't like it here, why'd you even come?""

My co-workers and I, all magazine editors, were shocked. We'd never seen anyone in the service industry so flagrantly spurn the rule ""the customer is always right."" We felt duped, belittled, and, above all, very insulted.

We were made to wait upwards of a half hour, and never heard from the manager about the matter again. Our server eventually came back and said, with no explanation, that they'd taken the $50 off our bill. On our way out, the manager wished us a happy holiday in a sarcastic, simpering voice.

Oh, and one of my co-workers got food poisoning. 

Bottom line: You don't ever, ever need to go to a place like this. Take your happy hour money somewhere else, anywhere else, where the drinks are cheaper and the servers seem to actually want their customers to be there.",1.0
"If I had written this review a year ago, I would have said I go to Penelope weekly and love it's menu and quality food. However, this is no longer true. Back in October, I went to Penelope for dinner with friends and ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip (see attached photo). A few minutes after digging in, we found an entire rubber glove in the dish. Needless to say we were horrified (and I have to say that the response from management was not great - they offered us free drinks but did not pay for our meal). So that experience was rough, but I assumed that it must have been a disgruntled employee who was surely was fired after the glove incident. So on Friday, I caved and gave Penelope another chance. I ordered the Chicken Meatballs, but I made a huge mistake. I got food poisoning and spent the next several hours throwing up. Obviously my formerly beloved Penelope is no longer. I am posting this so you don't make the same mistake that I did.",1.0
"So the last time I ate here I got food poisoning, for three days.  The kind of food poisoning where you would potentially prefer to crawl in a hole and die.  I had gotten a bagel with bacon cream cheese and I am guessing something was off in the cream cheese.  I am confident I got the food poisoning here, because I ate the bagel at 7:30 am, skipped lunch and dinner because I started to feel a bit upset in the stomach, and by 8pm was puking.  To give the place the benefit of a doubt I went again today and got a breakfast sandwich on a bagel.  The feta was bad, as in cheese/milk gone bad smell and I could absolutely taste it as well.  Ditched the entire omelet that was on the bagel and just ate the bagel.   I'm not sure what's going on here, but for $7 for a breakfast sandwich, I don't expect bad feta!  Lost my business.

I thought it was over, so I went back to sleep, only to be woken up again at 10 because I needed to use the bathroom. The minute I sat down on the toilet, I was retching again. After taking some medicine, I'm no longer nauseous, but, after laying in bed all day praying for it to go away, all the muscles in my body are aching. I don't know how I'm gonna draw the strength to get out of bed again tomorrow. Stay away from this place.",1.0
"Just had 2 pork souvlaki sticks last night, right before they were wrapping up to close (9:15pm). This was my first time at this particular souvlaki stand. The end piece on one of the sticks felt slightly under-cooked on its way down. By 3AM I was in severe stomach pains and evidently food poisoning. Its been almost 28 hours and still trying to recover, without having anything to eat for the last 24 hours.

First off, the options here were pretty limited. There were maybe 7 dishes going around constantly with the occasional item that we wanted. It was also a bit pricier than most places nearby, as the other reviewers noted they charge for tea.

Finally, I am 99% sure I got sick from the food here. Afterward I had a bout of food poisoning that left me unable to function properly for a week. So needless to say, won't be returning.",1.0

if you're still not convinced, they change prices on pizza and sandwiches as they please. If you're still willing to go here, I swear this sad excuse for an establishment, must be a money laundering scam.

I had ordered a fish sandwich with came with fries and a drink. The drink was a standard sized pepsi coke etc The fries were typical fries and had no extra flavor to them. (They were unsalted, condiments and extras have to be asked for while making an order) The fish sandwich was soggy and the vegetable oil can be tasted in the coating of the fish.

"To be honest, my experience here was about 4 stars - but I'll explain why I had to go with ""Meh, I've experiences better"" at 2 stars...

I came here awhile back to catch up with some friends in Sunnyside. One of them recommended this place and I was excited to try a new place in a neighborhood that I rarely frequent. Upon entering we were greeted warmly and given a table with minimal wait time.

Their dinner menu isn't the largest selection of entrees, but what they do have uses very high-quality ingredients and everything sounds pretty darn delicious. We all ordered different things. 

One of my friends ordered their Black & Green Lasagna which is a ""pasta free"" dish featuring bechamel, parmigiano and gremolata. Another friend ordered their Tomato and Cannellini Bean Soup which came with a poached egg, arugula and ricotta salata. The guy in our group ordered the Sirloin Tip Steak which came with roasted butternut squash, fried potatoes and pecorino crema. I went with the Roasted Bone in Murrays Chicken Breast which came served with a warm cous cous salad, pistachios and a house made yogurt & olive oil sauce.

My friend absolutely loved her ""pasta"" free Black & Green Lasagna and it looked very decadent. My other friend thoroughly enjoyed her Tomato and Cannellini Bean soup which also looked and smelled fantastic. My friend's Sirloin Tip Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare as he requested and I got to try a small piece and it was super juicy and flavorful. My chicken was delicious and the cous cous and in-house made sauce was absolutely divine.

Now, this restaurant is very dimly lit and has a romantical vibe going to it. There was also a candle on our table which reflected a bit of pinkness onto my white meat chicken breast. I wasn't concerned since this is such a nice looking restaurant so I gobbled up my chicken with no concern and assumed any slight discolorations were due to the candlelight reflecting off of a bottle of red wine that we ordered and were sharing at the table. I left here feeling peachy...

Until we walked to another restaurant to have a nightcap and grab dessert. I began to feel nauseous and worked up quite a sweat despite it being very cold out. I'll spare you guys the gory details, but let's just say that my delicious meal at Venturo Osteria didn't stay in my digestive system for very long. When I got home I also got chills, sweats, ran a fever and...regurgitated...again. 

Nothing I had eaten throughout the day (Special K cereal for breakfast, a bagel with cream cheese for lunch) was going to cause me to feel this way. How I felt that night came out of nowhere about 10 minutes after finishing my meal here and caused me to wonder whether or not I should have inspected my chicken breast better...I'm confident that my symptoms were synonymous with those of food poisoning. 

My fever and chills lasted hours into the early morning and I was afraid to keep anything down so I drank a lot of water and wrapped myself up in my boyfriend's comforter, burrito style.

This isn't, by any means, a cheap restaurant and what I ordered was a simple dish that should not have resulted in how I felt. This is why I have to rate my experience here 2 stars because my digestive system has apparently had better.",1.0
"My wife and I went here this past Friday after receiving the weekly Yelp newsletter. The reviews were encouraging so we went without a reservation and sat down at the bar. The bartender was friendly, the atmosphere pleasant and service very good. We had the bartender recommend a bottle of wine based on our food choices. The italian sausage appetizer was highly recommended, but wasn't anything special. We ordered the pork shoulder and black & green pasta. The 'pasta' dish was very nice and cheesy, the pork was deep-fried and undercooked. Unfortunately, I had eaten a bite before my wife noticed the raw pork. They cooked it further but my stomach had already started turning. I began feeling ill, asked for the check, pointed out the $40 bottle was $48 on our check, and left. These mistakes happen in the restaurant world, but food poisoning is no joke. A weekend spent in the bathroom, thanks Venturo.",1.0

"Extremely overpriced, $5 minimum, sassiest cashiers I've ever met.

Unfortunately, this spot is the most convenient lunch place for many offices in the area. Ashley's sure takes full advantage of it, charging $8.99 per pound on a crappy buffet filled with extremely oily yet dry meats and upcharging for snacks and yogurts throughout the rest of the store. P.S. If you want salmon or pork, be ready for potential food poisoning.

If you just wanted to get a yogurt or pick up some protein for your salad, you better have cash because this $5 minimum will be enforced with a side of sass.

Speaking of sass, I've never gotten more attitude from any service person before. These people raise the decibels to the extremes, often unreasonably screaming ""NEXT, WHO IS NEXT. NEXTNEXTNEXTNEXT"" from their counters. Meanwhile, you see customers stumbling over each other trying to get to the little counter space to check out and shut the cashier up.

HEY ASHLEYS--Up your service standards a bit. And by a bit, I mean A LOT. You're serving business people--not the lunch line in a prison.",1.0
"I WANTED to love this place.  Their delivery is fast, (don't go for sit down service as it's terribly slow), they have big salads, and they're super close to a business I own in NoLita.  Unfortunately there always seems to be a problem- and the food quality and portions are totally inconsistent.  I could easily give 15-20 examples of times Ive been disappointed -but will stop at 3.
1.  When they got my chopped salad order wrong the 3rd time in a row I called and complained. After  waiting 10 minutes to speak with a manager I finally spoke to a lovely man who promised my next salad was ""on him"".  When I tried to redeem this 2 days later, giving his name, no one seemed to know what I was talking about.
2.  One of my colleagues is absolutely positive that she got mild food poisoning after eating a simple chicken breast.  I witnessed (Warning, pushing gross) her multiple and unfortunate trips to the restroom.  We're sure we're right about this because it's happened more than once. 
3.  2 weeks ago, we made a very simple order.  It was incorrect, and we were accidentally charged $20 extra.  It was a busy day at our hair salon, and an assistant paid cash not knowing there was a mistake with the order. Less than 20 minutes later, when I opened my lunch, we called Spring Street Natural, told them what happened, asked for a replacement order and the refund due...  We waited on hold for over twenty minutes only to be transferred to different people and then told that they had switched to the afternoon staff, and our ""account"" would be credited.  In the meantime, We were getting HANGRY!!!  Given my previous experience with them offering credit, I didn't find this solution promising. After speaking to multiple people and explaining that we just needed our $20 back, they suggested for us to call back the next day. We did- to no avail. Our receptionist had to walk to the restaurant to retrieve the $20 for us that following day.

So, after considerably overpaying for not chopped chopped salads, dealing with consistently rude and apathetic service staff, and actually having to pay someone who works for me to walk to the restaurant and  pick up my $20, I've had it.  I feel terrible for their delivery guys, who must get abused by unhappy customers daily, (please always tip them well)!


The reason I gave them two stars instead of one is because every once in a while, the food was excellent.  Now that I've discovered ""Just Salad""  on Seamless we won't be ordering from Spring Street again.  Whew!",1.0
"You know when you are hungry, and your eyes are bigger than your stomach? Everyone has that moment every now and then. When that happens, just about anything taste good. That is what Napoli was like when i tried them out for the first time. This experimental pizza turned into many things.

The winter of 2015 has been brutal and i was understanding when the pizza arrived luke warm. I needed it pipping HOT, but ate it warm. The delivery man was very nice, but he must have held the pizza box in an odd position because the cheese from one side of the pie slid over to the other side and some slices were cheese-less. The sausages didn't seem like they were cooked all the way and should have been golden brown, instead they looked like a light shade of caramel which indicates it wasn't cooked all the way and probably just came out of the freezer.

I personally thought the pizza was not bad and their bread is not thick which is great because that kind of pizza is just horrible. I can't stand it when the bread is thick, hard, and dry. Their crust is good.

Get ready for this because here is the crazy part. I was sharing this pizza with a neighbor, but the next day, she had the runs. Except, the runs came out on the other hole. Oh yeah...it was non stop vomiting. I'd trade in vomiting for the green apple splatters any day. The bottom hole is always better than the upper hole. Food poisoning is the worst. Nobody wants to be attached to the toilet for 24 hours while they throw up endlessly to the point that there's nothing left to throw up. I am not sure what happened, but i am assuming it was the pizza. Pork is NOT beef and must be cooked all the way.

"Food poisoning, in which I assume the diarrhea I received trickled down from their management. Went there a few months ago and had three tacos:

Al Pastor - average, on the dry side, can't hold its weight against west coast counterparts. 

Mushroom - average

Oyster - super briny and smelled like Courtney Love was in town. This must have been the culprit. 

Atmosphere - shit show

Service - the cashier got my order wrong and then she got all pissy when I told her so. 

Within 10 minutes of leaving the place my stomach started rumbling. I ran to Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken just in time for the anal fukushima to begin. Date night was ruined and so was I. I didn't even have it in me to masturbate later that night.

The next day I emailed them about my mud butt but they didn't seem to care. They just asked me about my order and that was that. I answered and haven't heard a response since. I've called the Health Department since.

"I'm not sure how a $14 bowl of ramen is listed as one of the best ""inexpensive"" eats in New York, but okay... the ramen was decent. The broth was incredibly rich... *almost* too rich but I slurped the whole bowl down anyway! Decent ramen but not the best i've ever had.

Minus a star because my friend got sick (food poisoning, perhaps) afterward. In typical new york fashion, it is crowded and you will almost definitely have to wait to get in.",1.0
"First of all, terrible atmosphere and terrible service. My friend and I asked for something to break our fast with, this is a halal restaurant and the waiter did not even know what I was talking about when this is during the month of Ramadan. So I asked for water, and he came back and brought warm water. No ice in it, not cold and refreshing at all. There was this weird odor in the restaurant that I could not stand, not to mention there were also very loud customers that clearly had no manners and courtesy toward other customers who were trying to have a nice and peaceful dinner. The food was decent for reasonable prices but I still regret having Iftar at this restaurant. Terrible experience. As I'm typing this I'm starting to feel pretty sick, like food poisoning maybe.",1.0
"Bummer Burger. 

My first review ever on yelp, and I feel the need to pass this along to other people hyped on their menu, because let's face it, their atmosphere is the pits, just how bizarre this place is overall isn't worth it. 

For the price of about $13/meal, you get a lot of options. But our waiting staff didn't care to tell us about anything. We were rushed, and also one of the only tables there. Service gets one star. I was disgusted by his curtness and manners. He talked to his buddy at the front the entire time. 

The ambiance is also bizarre. It looks like an old dark tattoo shop that's been poorly converted. It didn't match the menu or waiter. 

And lastly the food. I liked the options of having chicken/turkey/veggie/bean/regular burgers. But then I got sick and wasn't feeling it afterwards. Yes, food poisoning alert. I had a bean burger with cheddar cheese. The fries were the best part. But repeat, don't do it. 

Don't eat here, don't even think for a moment your experience is going to be that one good one. It probably won't be.",1.0
"Went there for a quick snack....I got a bowl of soba and my boyfriend ordered the black cod fish

...15 min out of the restaurant and he has been getting the typical symptoms of food poisoning...vomiting and severe abdominal pains

One hours later, I called the restaurant ...and there is no manager to speak to...and the guy on the phone didn't understand what  ""got sick from the food"" nor what ""food poisoning"" meant. 

1.5 hours later, spoke to some guy who acknowledges the situation and didn't even apologize. ...he says ""it's the weekend and it's very busy...I don't know what to do for you now.  There is no manager.""

2 hours, I spoke to the hostess, who immediately said ""sorry""...and that a manager will call me back tomorrow.

PLEASE BEWARE since I feel the restaurant's staff is oblivious about food hygiene/ safety and how to handle to situation.

"Lived in the neighborhood since fall of 2011 when this place opened and have made probably close to 30-40 trips there since, if not more. Originally it was great and always packed, but the quality of food has slowly slipped over the past couple of years. Picked up takeout last Friday night with my regular order (one picadillo taco, one fried shrimp and one grilled chicken taco), feeling 100% fine. Come Saturday morning, I had a bad case of food poisoning that lasted for hours and Guero's was the only thing I ate between lunch and going to bed. Since Guero's opened a few years ago, the neighborhood has picked up tons of great restaurants, but unfortunately Guero's has not kept up. I will NOT be going back, which is a shame based on how much money I have spent there.
I have already put in an official complaint to NYC.gov, which I hope gets Guero's attention. But consider this a warning to any Crown Heights newbies--Rosco's, Mayfair, Berg'n, Glady's, Dutch Boy Burger, Barboncino, Cent'Anni or Chevela's are much better (and reasonably priced) restaurants in the neighborhood!",1.0
"I'm so disappointed, because I've so enjoyed the good here before... yet my last experience left me with the worst case of food poisoning ever. I've never been so sick before. I'm positive it came from my dinner here, because other than my fish tacos, I had only eaten bread (baked same-day) that day. The food poisoning lasted 3 days... and I'll spare the details, but I'm very afraid of going back and having episode two.",1.0

"I live in the neighborhood and have been to veggies several times.  The juice has always been just OK.  They don't use the freshest vegetables and fruit and none of it is organic so, like other reviewers, I'm not sure why the prices are so high.  

This leads me to my next point--that the last time I went, I'm sure that I got FOOD POISONING from their juice.  I had a juice with spinach and kale in it.  I knew I should have been more careful when I saw the guy putting some browning spinach leaves into the blender.  The juice wasn't even that great and within a few hours I was throwing up.  I'm very health conscious and aware of my body so I know that this juice is definitely the culprit, I had been feeling fine and not really eaten much else that day.

"We've been going to Chez Oskar at least once per year since 2003. Hubby actually proposed there.  I love the mussels but they are not usually offered for Valentine's Day (when we visit) but instead have a special menu.  

This year was very different.  They had a $65 per person special Valentine's Day menu; however, not only were the mussels not available for Valentine's Day but they also had a stripper.  Yes, a stripper at dinner.  Initially I thought it was a burlesque performer but as the show went on she took off her dress to reveal garters and then she removed her bra to reveal pasties.  This was at 9:45 pm on 2/14/2015.  Needless to say, I was shocked.  Granted, the meal was great but we won't ever go back after such an inappropriate display.  The waitress said this was a new entertainment segment since fall 2014 and the first Valentine's Day.  I can't imagine who thought it was appropriate to have a half naked woman, unshaven, around diners and food and for Valentine's Day no less.

Edited to add -  I ended up getting food poisoning from my meal at Chez Oskar and threw up at 1:45 am as well as had diarrhea.  I have not thrown up since 2004 after a meal on World Yacht dinner cruise where I also got food poisoning.  The only thing that reacts that fast is seafood and dairy so I'm guessing it was the lobster consume, the oyster shooter or maybe the dessert (white chocolate and banana mousse).  I'm guessing it was not the vodka and soda or mojito since I have those all the time.  Not what one would expect for $215.",1.0

The next day I was running a fever. I'm never forgiving this place. Please be cautious.",1.0
"Like other reviewers have mentioned, this place has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, they are falling short. I've been here three times and each time the quality is just a bit lower than the last. I would now describe the food as mediocre. I had a terrific watermelon margarita the first time I came; the next two times it was meh. Chicken taco had decent flavor, but nothing to write home about. Tasty salsa and guacamole served with unfortunately stale chips. The service was at best inattentive. Food for our party of four came at different times. Our waitress never came to check on us voluntarily...we had to ask for every water refill. And when we got the check, they added 20% gratuity to the bill, which was obnoxious and absurd and apparently gives staff no motivation to perform well. The kicker: My husband felt sick to his stomach the rest of the night and next day. We will not be coming back.",1.0
"I'm pretty obsessed with this place.

I've worked in pizza bars/restaurants for most of my adult life to date, so pizza is not new to me.

They have a crust that they have gone on record on their Facebook page as calling ""New England-style, which is basically a pan-pressed thin crust.  It utilizes a little more dough than your standard New York-style hand-tossed thin crust, but it isn't as thick as your Chicago-style deep dish.  One of the big chain restaurants does it this way.  I want to say Pizza Hut, but I could be wrong.  So it could go so wrong so easily but they execute it so right.

Hawaiian Pizza is my go-to in most situations, spicy if possible.  If they use canned pineapples like most pizzerias, it doesn't show, because they look prepped in-house.  The ham and hot cherry peppers aren't bad either.  By now I've also had my share of their other toppings by rotating out special slices, with no bad results to report so far.

Decent beer selection; they seem to stick to the same breweries but rotate the style represented by each brewery.  Full bar but not a particularly liquor-forward drink menu, and I don't know why you would expect one in a pizza place.  I had their hot toddy and it was really good.

The only grinder that I've had from them was their cheesesteak.  The next day I had a top-5-lifetime level of severe case of diarrhea, and it was completely worth it.  Maybe it was a mild case of food poisoning, maybe I have a gluten intolerance and the meat was slightly undercooked and/or cross-contaminated.  Maybe I got sick for an entirely different reason.  I don't care; the sandwich was delicious and I regret nothing.

They seem set up location-wise kind of specifically to cater to the Castle Braid complex, which I find to be interesting and probably a good move long-term for their bottom line.

They indicate that delivery is ""coming soon.""  I need to find a second job in preparation for that time.",1.0
"HEALTH DEPARTMENT RATING ""C""

STAY AWAY!!! FOOD POISONING!!!


First they have a C rating which they try to hide.
Secondly the rating is for meat and chicken that is spoiled and they vermin.

Third
We went to eat the other night and we had chicken and broccoli and fried rice.
The chicken tastes weird but didn't think of it being anything.  I had the worst case of food poisoning .. Beyond sick

I called the next morning to give them heads up and the lady's response was "" what do you expect me to do "" and there is nothing they would do cause we ate last night.

They seemed to not care , so I stopped in and the manager was very passive. He barely was concerned with the fact that I was to point  of going to the hospital with food poisoning.
He was more concerned with me not speaking to loud So other can hear.
Been here for couple

"Well I was really looking forward to ordering from this spot. I love indian food and I can eat enough naan bread to feed a small country lol. However I was very disappointed in how unappealing the food was. I ordered about $32 worth of food and was eager when it was delivered. The lamb tandoori was disgusting and the seafood curry was runny with teeny tiny pieces of seafood. It was bland and so tasteless that I couldn't even force myself to eat it ( yea I was gonna try to make myself eat it cause I spent $32 on it)!!  So I ate my bread, rice and French fries thinking ok so it wasn't a total waste of money.  WRONG!!! About 5 hours later I had a sever cause of FOOD POISONING!!! I was up all night vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and sever stomach pain.... I thought I was dying!!!

"I went here to meet a friend for drinks before their show, so it was convenient.

Pros:
The beer menu is great, lots of interesting beers/ale's/belguim ales
Location if you're going to a show
The staff was actually very nice (the bartender in particular, who I can't fault.

Cons:
I was sitting watching something and a group of guys came over and just changed the channel to football. I don't like football, and I would have been fine, but it would have been appropriate and polite for the bartender to ask if I minded since I was the only one sitting on that side at the time.
I ordered the cassoulet that was on special.  The sauce tasted ok, but when I was eating it, the beans were so mushy I could tell it had been sitting on a burner for ages. The sausages were over cooked and a bit tasteless, and the chicken thighs (the cheapest part of the chicken) seemed like they were dumped in there as an afterthought.  I ended up getting food poisoning and spending a portion of my night nauseous before spending some time in the bathroom (and I'm sure it was their food, because I had only had some fruit earlier and a croissant from the same place I'd had it two days in a row).  Disgusting food... 


In sum:   If you going to get a beer, and nothing else, sure, they have a nice selection and it may be convenient for you.  Do NOT come for the food.",1.0

As soon as I paid, I ran around the corner and let's just say what happened next wasn't a pretty sight. I got food poisoning and that whole experience was so unpleasant, it has scared me away from ever trying eating there again!

"Do yourselves a favor: Don't come here.

This place banks off the fact that there isn't much to eat around it, otherwise I can't fathom how they would still be in business.

I immediately asked for some water, which didn't come for another fifteen minutes, even though there were only two other parties there. The rest of the experience went completely downhill. 

My sandwich sat under the hot lamp for so long that it's contents completely melted into a mayo drenched puddle. My boyfriends burger on the other hand, which took thirty minutes, was completely raw in the middle. I love paying fifteen dollars for food poisoning. Our soups took what felt like forever, as well. The waiter felt awful and comped the meal, but I'm still annoyed as fuck. So annoyed that I'm writing this review from the restaurant. I feel bad for the waiter who had to apologize and serve me a stale ass cookie as some sort of reparation. Very sad.

"I'm so conflicted about this place. The food is so good, hands down the best and most authentic pho I've had in Queens. (On a side note, Thai Son in Chinatown takes that award). Anyway, yes, the pho is delicious. Sure, the service is lacking but that's not why this place is getting a 2 star review. After eating here one day, my boyfriend got food poisoning for the next 48 hours, and considering how his bowl of pho was the only thing he'd eaten in the past day, it's without a doubt that Phobang was the culprit.

As for the service our host and waitress were very kind and provided fast service. We also shared a laugh here and there. The food was good. But I'm sure you're asking why two stars? Well although everything seemed to be good something about the food was off. Yes it tasted good. And most of the food was finished. While taking my last few bites I started feeling sick. Not in a ""over eating more than I can handle"" type of way. I ate just enough so that I was satisfied. But I ended up getting food poisoning. Something from what I ate just didn't sit well with me. Maybe it's just bad luck that for my first time there that happens to me. But sadly I don't think I'll be coming back.",1.0

We went straight home after dinner and about an hour later, my son started vomiting and vomiting, which turned into the worst case of food poisoning I've ever seen.  He was sick the entire night until after 7am the next morning.
Later that day we called the restaurant to let them know, as a courtesy, in case the tuna was bad.  The woman we spoke with was very apologetic and said that she would inform the chef and have the manager get back to us.  After days of not hearing anything, my husband called back and spoke with the ""manager"" who basically was dismissive and blew us off.  His response was, ""Well no one else got sick from the tuna.""  My husband's response was, ""that you know of, but our son did.""

"I ate there last Monday, my friend and I had 3 courses each, with wine. I ordered the: 

Cold smoked scallops | cucumber | pear | black garlic | sea beans 16
Lamb | mint | Jerusalem artichoke | grains 35 
Passion fruit pavlova | strawberries | cream 13

 My friend had the foie gras, lamb and pavlova too.

I awoke in the early hours of Tuesday morning incredibly nauseous and spent most of  Tuesday vomiting and with diarrhea.  It could only have been the scallops as my friend ate exactly the same other courses.

 Although the presentation was nice, the portions were incredibly small. I still felt somewhat hungry after the meal.  The lamb was also cooked medium despite me asking for and being told it was served medium-rare. The wine for $14 a glass was only filled to allow for two or three sips, not even half a glass.

I wrote via Open table to express my utter disappointment at what was meant to be a celebratory meal, at a Michelin starred restaurant.   I received no acknowledgment from the restaurant whatsoever and having spent over $200 on our meal it would have to be one of the worst dining experiences I have had (I have eaten street food in countries across the globe and never once been poisoned!)

I have gotten food poisoning before from their chicken patties if you ever notice on the meat packaging it will say packed on such and such a date.

"Torn between one star or 3 stars. 

I go to this deli because it's next door to my office but if it wasn't, I probably wouldn't go at all. 

PROS
- very wide selection
- nice asian twist 
- large and spacious deli with eating area both upstairs and downstairs
- plenty of cash registers so there's never really a line
- nice selection of hard to find/international treats
- the Mongolian Grill : a create your own grill with a huge selection of food
- the noodle soups  and sushi, made in front of you and taste great
- macaroni and cheese or mashed potatoes are great
- nice create your own pasta bar
- friendly staff

CONS
-a bit pricey
-food is left out all day, got food poisoning from crab meat salad once (don't go after 2pm at latest)
- Mongolian grill food is left out and defrosts under the hot lights, this can't be healthy
- no reception in downstairs eatery
-EXTREMELY slow deli counter. Takes about 15 min to get a grilled cheese, but the chef is a nice person

So yea, I give it one star because of the food poisoning and because the deli is so slow, especially in the morning. But then I tacked on two because the staff is so nice and the mongolian grill, noodle soups and pasta bar are original and add variety which is a little hard to find in a monotonous NYC lunch world. Though a bit pricey, it's still cheaper then surrounding midtown eateries.

Just to sum this up, I was going to give this place two stars until my pros outweighed my cons....I guess it's a love-hate relationship.",1.0
"I started to feel really strange halfway through my meal and had to stop eating it because my stomach was so full of gas. My friend wanted a picture of us together so I stood up for a moment to take it. That's when I rushed to the bathroom. 

I threw up EVERYTHING. It took three hurls to get it all out and let me tell you, that spicy margarita is the LAST thing you want coming back around. I was rinsing my mouth with water when my bowels seized up. Back to the toilet! Here's some technical info: That part was NORMAL but my body was kicking everything out and FAST. To get graphic, I didn't have diarrhea, which would imply I'd eaten food earlier that did this to me (GOOGLE IT), but I did have a wee bit of diarrhea the following morning thanks to lingering food poisoning. 

And here's the real kicker: I told the manager what had happened. He implied that because I hadn't eaten meat there's no way it could have been food poisoning. This guy runs a restaurant and doesn't know how food poisoning works! He sat at the bar sipping whiskey and I had to ask our waiter to move so I could sit and continue speaking to the manager because I had the shakes. Nobody seemed to care! Then I had to actually ASK the manager to comp my meal because he was basically just telling me that it might not have been the food. 

He comped my entree but not my two drinks - the drinks that were no longer even inside of me because someone scratched their ass crack before handling my food. 

I just wanted OUT so I paid $30 for two cocktails and $20 for the cab I had to take home since I was worried I'd pass out on the subway. 

And for the record, everything else I'd eaten that day was food I had at home, all of which was the SAME food I'd eaten without problem the day before.",1.0
"Just to clarify, this review is based on numerous experiences at this place. When they first opened the place seemed great. Food was good, staff was friendly and service was fast. That all changed fairly quickly. Eventually I noticed that after every meal I ate here (particularly salads) my stomach would be totally messed up for days afterwards. It took me a few weeks to tie it together, but something from this place was messing with my stomach. After asking some friends, a few were experiencing the same thing. Tremendous bloating, stomach pain and even other stomach ailments. From that point on I never ate here again and thankfully never felt that way again. Recently a friend of mine ate here and had caught food poisoning.
 I do want to state that I also know people who eat here and don't have any issues, but those of us that have had problems were uncomfortable to say the least, for a few days. I also agree with other reviewers about the staff being incredibly rude, especially over the phone. Someone else mentioned that they don't wipe down their knives and such, which is also an issue if you have any allergies. They should probably wash their greens and quinoa, as that tends to cause stomach pain, bloating and in some cases food poisoning. 
Just my two cents. Clearly there are people who haven't had problems here, but you have been warned.",1.0
"First off I got food poisoning and I didn't eat anything raw. I had a tuna salad. 

Waiter took forever to even ask us what we wanted to drink. We sat there for over 20 min. 

After we ordered drinks it took 20 min to receive 2 beer and a glass of wine. Then he put them down we were ready to order and then he said ok 1 min and left for another 15. 

Food was good but then I got sick all night. Tried to get a second drink and couldn't find our waiter. 

There was 3 of us we spent over 300$ and the service was awful. I then told him we were tax exempt. Gave him my card he seemed annoyed came back to give it to my friend I grabbed it and he wouldn't let go as he kept trying to give it to my male friend. I said no it's my husbands the man across from me. No apologies nothing not even a thank you and we left him 25% for shitty service


The bus boy was awesome though I hope he gets part of it. I would have given him cash if I had any on me. That's why the two stars.

We came here to entertain a diplomat from out of town. He has been in a hardship country and we totally recommended we go here as he wanted fresh seafood. I was embarrassed with the service and the lack of it and the rudeness. We will not be back.",1.0
"Came today for the first time for breakfast. The hostesses first wanted to sit me by the bar but I refused and the expression she gave was rude when I asked about sitting at a table. She sat me down and the waiter came to take my order. I told him I wanted the lumberjack without sausage or ham. He said that I could Only substitute the ham and sausage for something else and the waiter said that I could only substitute it for extra beacon. Also when I asked about pancake substitution the waiter told me for wholewheat is another order or for blueberry is $2.50 extra! 
The waiter brought me silverware and it was dirty! The fork was used and covered in grease from an omelet and the knife was sticky with jam. Disgusting!!! The table service was slow when I told my waiter I needed a new silverware. 
When the meal came which was pretty small.. There was only two stupid stripes of bacon and there was dirt on my pancakes. I ate it anyway but I got food poisoning. 
Left the restaurant I had to take an tums and medication. I was still feeling sick the rest of the day. Thanks a lot!",1.0

I'd warned him about this place, and couldn't resist the ""I told ya so"" jab.

"ZERO STARS!  

UNACCEPTABLE!

This meal was disgusting!  Honestly, I would have gotten a better meal if I were to drink clam chowder right out of a fisherman's old rain boot (after he's stuck his foot in it).  Yeah, that's how bad it was!

This restaurant makes me feel terrible.  First of all, I spent $30 on my meal and ended up throwing a good portion of it in the trash, just like the net amount listed on my paycheck.  I work so hard to earn my money and the government comes in and throws a good portion of it in the trash.  What I am left with is small, insignificant, and sad.  In addition to being a waste of money, it has been about 40 minutes since I finished eating.  My stomach is making all sorts of growls and rumblings and I really feel like I swallowed a bunch of rocks.  I would not be surprised if I wake up tomorrow morning with food poisoning.  Where is the New York Department of Health when you need them?

The quality of the food was so poor.  I ordered fried tofu, tomago, and the beef teriyaki entree with salad.  

I started with the salad.  I ended up picking out some rotten lettuce bits and one piece of bird seed (I have a budgie, so I know what bird seed looks like, and by golly, that was a bird seed in my salad - and no - my budgie did not throw it there when I wasn't looking).  The salad was as unwashed as a cheap and haggard hooker.  It tasted no different than if I went outside and started eating the dirt out of my neighbor's garden.  The ginger dressing was runny and watery...it didn't stick to a single piece of salad.  I ate about 80% of the salad and then I couldn't stomach eating anymore.

Next I ate the tomago.  Well, I ate exactly one bite of the tomago.  Instead of tasting like the delicious egg custard I was expecting, it takes like fish scales that had been scraped off the fish and thrown away two days ago.  Barf!

Since I was quickly forming a guilt complex from throwing away food I just shelled good money out for, I decided to go ahead and try the beef teriyaki.  I opened the container and was in disbelief.  What sat in that container was the nastiest, fattiest piece of leather ever.  I ate two pieces and had to stop.  It was turning to wood in my throat and choking me.  It was then that I noticed that the meat had a green tinge to it!  It was rotten!  I wouldn't have known from the taste of it because my taste buds had already been assaulted with dirt salad and fish scale custard!  So there was more food thrown away.  

Lastly, I tried the fried tofu.  So gross.  It was basically chunks of tofu covered in a soggy, chewy material (I cannot claim this to be any sort of breading...it was muck).  This rubbery, soggy sheath held in at least a half tablespoon of bitter cooking grease that the tofu was more than happy to absorb.  Imagine eating cold McDonald's French fries that just soaked in the fry vats for about 24 hours, in oil that hasn't been cleaned or replaced in at least a month. Mmmmmm...sounds so appetizing, doesn't it?

It's such a disservice when restaurants charge hard working people so much money (my dinner totaled $30) and serve them nothing but crapola that essentially wasn't even fit for safe consumption.

"Food Poisoning.

I thank god for being merciful enough to delay the onset of this food-borne illness until after the ballet I attended shortly after eating here. Despite a bit of gastric distress during the epic finale of the Mariinsky Company's Swan Lake, my very own cursed lake (of vomit) began forming conveniently around 3 am-- and its unrelenting force continued well into dawn, and well into the next day.

""Oh! If only true love could stop this curse!"" I found myself screaming into the porcelain bowl, my insides retching, partially-chewed pieces of my soul dribbling down my chin. But alas, I am no Swan Queen. I must live this curse. And I found solace in acceptance, and I laid down my weary head, swirling with visions of spinning white tutus and undercooked shawarma. Can cabbage slaw really appear brighter this time around? Or is this yet another feverish hallucination? And next to my resting place I secured an empty whole foods bag and lined it with a black plastic bodega bag and it was into this bagly duo that satan's rain poured forth. Curled into a fetal hunch, rocking slowly between fits of vomiting, I stayed in this dark chamber for a night and a day, and no prince came, and the curse would not lift.

Beware the chicken shawarma.

"What did I leave this restaurant with? A cool, souvenir glass cup that comes complimentary with any alcoholic drink, and food poisoning.

Don't be fooled into the aesthetically pleasing style of the restaurant with its fancy bar lights and cool Mexican theme, it's a trap.

They claim to have the best guacamole in NYC but it's nothing but ordinary. It's tasty but I've definitely had better. As for the entrees, they're burritos and quesadillas are quite gross. I feel bad saying that the food is so bad, but really, don't go here. My burrito was filled with gooey cheese that was barely discernible between what I thought was sour cream and american cheese, and the beans are flavored with some $2 McCormick ready made spice bags. As for the side of cheese we got for our fries, it was definitely tostitos cheese from the can. How disgusting.

But, the only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is because of the drinks. They're drinks are $13 for a hefty size and a good amount of alcohol. And you get to keep the souvenirs glass!

Service: not too bad. Food came fast (not surprised for that considering everything they served us was probably from a can).

Overall, maybe go for drinks but that's really it. The food made me sick to my stomach and left me with cramps for the night and the day after!",1.0
"Went here with a some high expectations. Unfortunately, this place didn't reach them. I have to give them this from first impression, walking in there seemed like a good choice. Nice looking place/environment, music, and constant people walking in. I was excited to eat as I sipped on my beer enjoying time with family. However, when the food reached our table i was the least bit thrilled with what i saw on my plate. It was fake Mexican type of food, it was not real authentic mexican food. Sad to say it didn't end here. As i walked out of the place the sickness began. I felt sick to my stomach for the rest of the day and got some awful food poisoning. Me or my family will not be returning to Calexico for our own safety.",1.0
"I was here recently and I wanted to give it a chance. Well another chance, to be exact a third. I say this because I've gone to their truck at least twice. Sadly, both time I went, I got sick from what I ate. I'm not sure if it was the meat or the veggies but I was out of commission for a few days. I tested the waters and went again. This time the service sucked. I mean the cashier was too busy texting on his phone to notice me and the other people forming a line. Then there was the fact that the music was so loud and not to mention inappropriate. I found myself having to compete with the music just so they can hear my order. One thing that also made me hate my experience was witnessing how the owner of the company treated his employees. I saw him cursing out two of the guys while they sat there in shock not even responding. It got to a point where he got insanely close. I'm sitting there hearing him argue and go in on them and I'm in disbelief. What kind of company does that in front of customers? Its disgusting. On that alone, I should've just canceled my order and left. But I was hungry. Big mistake. I got food poisoning and had to go to the er. My advice...AVOID KORILLA BBQ AT ANY COST! Its overpriced. Its obvious that they don't care about their consumers if they serve food that makes people sick. And they lack professionalism and integrity(saw it firsthand) The food isn't what it once was. Go to Mandubar or Jum Mum for great Korean BBQ. You won't be disappointed by those places.",1.0
"STAY AWAY! I had been to this place twice before, and it was so-so the first two times. Being too lazy to look up reviews for other places in the neighborhood, I decided to go here again after work with a friend. I met the friend here and we both ordered the Filet Salmon. It tasted okay, not that great but we finished it paid and left. 

When I got home my stomach was burning and I felt queasy, I ran to my bathroom and well... you can imagine what happened from that point on. I was sick with food poisoning for the rest of the night, it was a nightmare and I had to call out from work the next day cause I was up till the wee hours of the morning letting everything ""flush"" itself out.

I didn't anything out of the ordinary that day except the salmon and what makes me 100% it was Prima Pasta was that my friend who had the same dish also had food poisoning. 

I usually don't write reviews but I had to sign up and tell people to stay away. Be safe and be smart, I really hope that no one else who ordered the salmon that night got sick because it was a nightmare for me :(.",1.0
"MATT''S FAT ON OUR BACKS!
Horrible Food!  Irresponsible Management. Crazy-Making Owner!

DRINK BUT DO NOT EAT!
The food is consistently horrid. Overpriced. 

Made the mistake on Friday night and I was sick on Saturday. I knew better because it's my default bar for buying clients' drinks (no longer), but not food (because it sucks); -But that sorry night I was hungry and not about to leave. I've only had food poisoning thrice before.

BOOZE
Bartenders will clear your beer in less than 20 seconds if you leave it (to go to the washroom or to the coat-rack (This night staff asked us to take our coats to the coat-rack and by time we returned two  untouched beers were already removed!!! (CRAZY).) (It's really preposterous their diligence in this regard. SERIOUSLY -It could not have been 20 seconds between ordering and receiving those beers and taking our coats to the rack and returning and the beers were gone! (Of course when you need a drink... )

These 2 beers were replaced, but  the staff was annoyingly defensive about it. They did nothing wrong in their mind AND we HAD to know about it.  It seems from my review of Yelp's reviewers that poor customer treatment or disrespect is a recurring theme. I concur and add that my experience has been that it seems like there is a heightened level of defensiveness. Maybe it's just me.

THREE COATS WERE STOLEN (My Friend's, Mine & at least one other patron's!)
Three  coats in one night! I went back and visited the owner of the bar (Matt) on Christmas eve (3 days later) at 11:30 am. He made me wait until 12:15 before he graced me. I asked for his help in catching the perpetrators of the heist.

Though we had reason to theorize it might be an inside job because of unusual staff behavior, I explained to him that I did not want to accuse anyone without proof. I asked for access to the video files of the coat rack. He was defensive and would not capitulate. He said that he had already reviewed the tapes and that he would review them again! Well Matt what is the harm of the people that had their coats taken looking to see for themselves and to try to piece together the truth?

What good is him looking at the tapes unless he knows which coats were stolen and who's coat was whom's and who might have been running the gauntlet. I am sure that there are a hundred excuses for what might have happened (Matt  said three times that someone probably just put on the wrong coat by mistake!!!

Well Matt,  It's been 4 days! If it was three honest mistakes, why haven't the 3 coats been returned? What a confabulating bozo!

When I pressed to see the tapes myself so that we could determine if there was a connection to the Staff Member that we suspected of running diversions he asked if I wanted to go downstairs and look at the tapes now. I called his bluff, and when I did, he reneged on the offer and said that he is too busy. He then said that the management  had already contacted the Police! Do you believe that? It seemed like he would say anything that came to mind to sandbag our efforts to get to the bottom of the rip-off.

I can't prove that the coat-wrestling was an inside job but something's fishy when one of the restaurants staff (that you don't know from Adam) interrupts you and a friend (for no reason)  (and physically touches and seems to be intent on distracting your attention several times). If Matt had of let us review the tapes then at least we could have ruled this out.  Apparently, Matt has little interest in finding out if his staff were stealing coats. 

He didn't have to walk home in a T-Shirt early in the morning on December 20th! He didn't have to spend hours shopping for a new coat. The many hundreds of dollars being spent at Paragon Sports or Bloomingdale's or where ever else were not coming out of his wallet!  Rather, quite fortuitously we paid him to drink in his bar! So Matt's fat on our backs! 

BETTER PLACES TO GO
Before you go here, read more reviews. The only reason that I ""expensed"" so many $ here a year (until now) was because it is only a few steps from our office. 

KARMA
Having something stolen from oneself is a harrowing thing. That's bad enough, but when there isn't empathy or cooperation from the establishment where the foul deeds occurred,  that deserves some thought by a decent and self-aware community.  If it were my town, we'd banish you.

HOW NOT TO
The Australian should be a Harvard Business Review article about how NOT to run a business. Many more dollars are lost, by not accepting responsibility or caring about your patrons.

I don't know what possessed me to keep eating it - I didn't like it at all, but kept giving it a try over and over until it was gone.

the croquettes are just bad - they're tiny little pre-frozen tater-tot looking things that did nothing but burn my mouth.

the mussels - oh my god, the mussels!  I felt so bad my husband ordered these - 1/3 were not even open indicating that they were bad, and another 1/3 were RAW!  yes, raw.  no doubt about it.  this was the only dish we complained about and were thrown a free creme brulee at the end of the meal, but you've just got to wonder about a restaurant when you are served under cooked mussels.

the ""risotto"" was not at all risotto.  it wasn't even a little creamy, cheesy or tender, just a bowl of rice mixed with roasted peppers, mushrooms and saffron.  my friend had a few bites and just left the rest, this is where I felt absolutely terrible for recommending the place.  the poor girl went hungry.

and finally, the ugly:

as we walked home, I started feeling nauseous... we got home around 11:30pm, I woke up at 2am completely sick at both ends and have been in bed all day today with body aches and a fever.  

to be fair, I'm hesitant to call it food poisoning because it's a very nasty thing to just blame a restaurant for - also nobody else from my party got sick and I was around a pukey kid a few days ago so it could have just been a stomach bug, but regardless, this is the type of experience that just ruins any thought of ever going back there.  bleh.",1.0
This place has a friendly staff and what I thought was delicious food. I went there last night for restaurant week! But sadly about midnight it was clear I had eaten something bad and was up all night sick with food poisoning. I had the corn soup/fried chicken/Creme brûlée. The only thing I thought may be off was the Creme brûlée. It had a odd warm butter on it and it wasn't a pleasant temperature. Too bad. Pretty pricy to get food illness! Not recommending this place but I really wanted to. Beware.,1.0
"Tenzan has been my go to place whenever I had a craving for sushi. I've eaten there dozens of times before. The food had always been good, and the service was okay, sometimes slow. However on the night of 7/21/15 I had a horrible experience at Tenzan midtown east location. I came in for a friend's birthday dinner at around 8pm. Ordered a strawberry mojito and two rolls: spicy tuna hand roll and Double Taste special roll (that was my first time trying that roll). An hour after I finished eating, I felt sick to my stomach, went to the bathroom and vomited. Subsequently I made a trip to the bathroom two more times where I vomited again and again. After my third trip to the bathroom, I was exhausted, upset and really concerned about the quality of fish that was put in to the rolls I've had for dinner at Tenzan. So I asked to speak to the manager, and told him what I had ordered and that it had made me sick. I asked him to check the ingredients they had used to make the sushi rolls I had to prevent other customers from getting sick. The way the manager handled this situation was in fact the worse part of my Tenzan experience. It was the worst customer care I've ever received! He disbelieved me, claiming that no one else in the restaurant got sick that day and instead of offering to take the price of the Double Taste sushi roll out of the bill, he asked me what I ate for lunch and suggested that I got food poisoning from the food I've eaten earlier that day. He told me that I need to go to a doctor and get a medical note stating that I had food poisoning from their fish, and then he might be able to do something for me. The way the manager handled my complaint made me really uncomfortable on top of being already physically sick with food poisoning. I am definitely not coming back due to the compete lack of customer care more so than the quality of food.",1.0
"FOOD POISONING *****

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Why? Because my boyfriend got FOOD POISONING on Christmas. He ordered spicy tuna and shrimp tempura roll for dinner. Came home throwing up with a super high fever (etc). and if you ever had food poisoning you know that you should always avoid to eat at places where you know you will get sick from it unless you want to be bedridden for 3 days throwing up with shivers, migraine, dehydrated and can't eat anything but unseasoned soup. 

Take my advice, the decoration is gorgeous and a nice environment but beware of their food. I already filed a report to the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH at nyc.gov or call 311.

"Came here around 2pm on a Sunday. The menu looked promising, I ordered some sort of egg and cheese sandwich that came between two waffles with bacon and maple syrup, sounded amazing... The food tasted alright but was very clearly not fresh. It was literally removed from a microwave within view and presented to me. I also noticed a bunch of waffles just laying around, presumably to be reheated for future orders. The cheese on the sandwich was that sort of half-melted plastic-looking consistency, like when you don't cook the food (or microwave it...) long enough. I'm also fairly certain I got food poisoning because, without getting into TMI territory, I've been sick for several days after and this place is my only dietary variable in the time period. I came with two friends who ordered in succession with me just minutes a part but we all started and finished our food in intervals as they were prepared, or most likely, re-heated. The only nice thing I can really say is that the staff were really nice and upbeat.",1.0

"Stay away! I'm generally not the type to write bad reviews-it takes a lot for me to muster the courage to post that one star review, but I got food poisoning here! And I've had worse in my lifetime, but still food poisoning from a restaurant is still something that could have been prevented with a little QC. Because of that lobster roll, I was unable to eat for a good three days. It's a shame because I was here celebrating a friend's birthday and the service was great, but the food, even without the food poisoning, was so lackluster. 

I ordered the lobster roll off the restaurant week menu ($4 extra charge for the lobster roll) and the flavor just seemed a bit off. The pieces of lobster was masked by the strange mayonnaise flavor, so I was unable to tell how fresh the lobster tasted, but even then it didn't taste like the typical lobster roll you get at Luke's. My boyfriend ordered the grilled salmon and legit the portions they gave him were tiny! The piece of salmon was smaller than his fist, which just looked ridiculous in comparison to the size of the plate. They tried to fill up the plate by sprawling out the asparagus, but cmon, I see you! At least serve the fish on a smaller plate because the impression of such a small piece of salmon on a large dish was just so off-putting. Sadly to say, my boyfriend was not full from his dish. As for appetizers (yes I know, wrong order), boring dishes with small portions! It's not the worst but definitely not the best. I really don't like writing mean things, but the salad I ordered was so eh- I've definitely had better at Applebee's. And lastly desserts. Beware, all on the restaurant week menu are super chocolatey, whether it be the profiteroles or the pecan bourbon pie. I didn't even finish my pecan pie and I'm not one to waste food...at all.

This restaurant sorely underdelivered for restaurant week and also got me really sick so if anything, I would avoid City Lobster if I were you. Maybe they're less stingy with their potions for their non-RW selections but even then, watch out on what you eat because their food isn't that fresh.",1.0
"I was really excited that this place was open at 2 am when i left the club and was STARVING. 

Their pizza is pricey.. yes. But they have a right to charge $5 a slice since they are the only thing open for blocks..

I considered going to the hospital! Never have I ever been in so much pain!
And all i ate were 2 slices of a regular pizza, no meat nothing.

I was about to go to the emergency room but instead called my father, a doctor, who paid me an after-hours visit at the end of the second day of the ordeal. He called two infectious disease experts he knew and they all concluded I had severe Campylobacter poisoning. Look it up, it's no joke.

I emailed first (it was 4:30 a.m. after all) and got an automatic reply with the promise of a response...but no response, ever. I called later the next day and someone said the manager would get back to me...but he never did.

Wasted a whole weekend and barely made it work, due to almost fainting on the subway. Summer heat at 90 degrees doesn't help either.

"Yuck. 

My first visit to Sarabeth's Tribeca was about a year ago. I was attending a work event that reserved a private area for a buffet luncheon. I found the food to be average, but immediately stopped eating as soon as I realized the jumbo shrimp was completely gray inside... as in raw. Unfortunately I had already eaten several bites, so I did end up feeling sick afterward, but luckily I didn't require medical attention, which I would have had I eaten a substantial amount, as eating uncooked shrimp is extremely dangerous. 

A year later, I seemed to have put the experience behind me. While out and about with my husband and daughter in the area, we decided to stop for lunch/brunch, and decided to not order something that could potentially be undercooked. Perhaps, I thought, that was a unique instance. 

We stupidly didn't just go absolutely anywhere else. 

Since we arrived at 3:04, and Late Lunch begins at 3pm, we were not permitted to order from the brunch menu that we watched be served to patrons for the next hour. The Late Lunch menu is totally underwhelming. I ordered a Caesar salad, and for $18, you might think that you'd get a little dressing or  something more thoughtful than four 8"" long stalks of uncut romaine lettuce. Although it wasn't busy, we were sat beside a noisy kitchen, where staff slammed into our table between yelling with each other as they zoomed by, nearly knocking over hot coffee on my infant daughter. A busboy spontaneously snatched away our sugar tray as we had our coffee, and getting someone to bring the food we ordered (and ordering to begin with was challenging enough) was unreasonably difficult. We couldn't even leave in a reasonable amount of time because getting our check proved impossible, as did getting them to process and return our credit card. Water refill? Forget about it. Nobody cares what you want or if you end up getting what you ordered. 

Service is nonexistent at Sarabeth's, and the food is at best bland and at worst dangerous. Tribeca has plenty of restaurants- Skip Sarabeth's unless you're a glutton for punishment.",1.0

"My go-to Korean market for everything Korean! We grab our giant sacks of rice, premarinated Korean BBQ meats, tofu, packaged kimchi, and other Korean food items here. 

I'm here almost every other week, and it's been such a regular part of my life. When my mom comes to town we go there to grab giant cases of Korean cabbage so that she can make me Kimchi! 

They have a small fish monger area in the back, and Ikura and UNI! I've always been suspicious of uni at Asian supermarkets - I'm occasionally served horribly bad uni at sushi places so have assumed that it's really hard to get quality uni.

As good as the $12.99 tray of uni I got at Mitsuwa in Edgewater last week! Rock on!

"DT was my long time friend!
now it's over ! bye DT!! writing bad review!
first time negative, long time ago i got a tiny stone into my burrito! almost crack my tooth!! the one on lexington location! went to the register dropped it on the counter and asked for my money. only 'oh sorry about that"" was barely to hear. we cant do nothing about it, sometimes stones get into food WTH !!?.

other thing i super hate is.
if you come for a burrito and there is a line and even there is no space and there are 3 people in front of you, because the servers and cashier taking slow, they keep taking orders and you need to scream over if you want chicken or steak in your burrito. i have to scream my order before taking my food ???, i want to eat and relax! is there a time line to order ? c'mon!

if the space clears and you ready to pick rice beans or none of it, they ask you twice if you want chicken or steak. short memory ?
if you tell the server that you hate cheese on the bottom and would like to skip it, it makes the burrito really sticky! (THATS THE GUY WHO ALWAYS REQUESTS NO CHEESE!) thats what the female worker said last time.

but then they make it anyway because they talk with each other and simply disregard the customer. and if you want anything extra they disregard you !! but still try to sell it to you if its wrong. with lots of argumentation they toss it and make it if you really demand it.

still somehow remembering no cheese, it comes to the point of finish where salsa, guac and cheese comes to play. you have to repeat many times to them no cheese. no thank you!! 
or if you skip the point with requesting no cheese they ask when almost done, oh but there is cheese on the bottom, you still want cheese !?!?! WTF?

then another thing , they ask ...guac... tomatoes ...i say no salsa ... they repeat again ...you want no tomatoes!? i repeat please! no tomatoes !! they are already in the guac leave me alone please no.
why their guac has so much tomatoes in it ? why they dilute guac with so much tomatoes???? its like watery paste without any taste!
but charge it extra like it would be real guac!!?! it wasn't that way at the beginning!!

today came in for my burrito, when order was placed and the guy was about to put beans on it, i checked my pocket and except few singles i had a $100 bill. i asked the cashier if that would be ok, he refused and pointed out to next door to get a change!! c'mon !! my money is bad ????
day ruined! got food somewhere else!!

by reading this review with the bad chicken, now is clear why i got bad sick !!!
i remember my order of grilled steak last month, i haven't eaten anything that day except this burrito but, late afternoon i got so sick i was sweating and shaking badly !! my stomach was HELL!!

"I have been to pranna four times:
The first time time was New Year's Eve. We paid 110 as a last minute resort for plans. It was def not worth it. The music was bad, the coat check tried to charge my friend double because she had a coat and a heavy sweater being that it was liquor, and drunk people dancing on me and spilling my drinks when there is more than enough space is not fun. The free apps got me sick and the crowd wasn't as mixed as I would have liked. Too much money for a waste of time. I think we were out if there before two.

The second was in March for one of my close friends birthday brunch. We arrived and were seated downstairs in a booth in the back, downside to that was the table being so low but everyone enjoyed their food and being that they have the carafes already ready at the bar it was easy getting refills. The booth we were placed in had me sitting right next to this man who was seated at his a table, if I fell I probably could have been in his lap. There were no problems with the drinks and everyone loved their food from the fried chicken, to the burger, and crab cakes. After about about two hours maybe three they start clearing the tables, folding them
Up, and pekoe started moving upstairs for the party portion. We stayed downstairs for a but dancing, taking pictures and finishing our drinks. When we were ready we headed upstairs and joined the dance floor. The music was great hip hop, top 40 r&b, and reggae. We danced until the end and our buzz lasted us all the way there and after. All in all it was a great day.

The last two times I went there for the party after brunch, it's free for girls to get in at that time and ten dollars for guys. The first time the dj was good and everyone was in a party mood in the main room in the back. My drink was ten bucks, gone on two seconds and filled with ice. The last time

Apparently when you tell the manager that there is visible mold on your burrito you are banned from the restaurant. They were told that they can leave without pay but may never come back.

"Well well another review. This chipotle location is new, it does look different it still has that chipotle feel, there are good things about this place and there are very serious negatives. Let's dive in. 3...2....1 starto!! 
     Let's start with talking about the building itself: it's a new location so seating areas are clean, floors are mopped regularly (saw one of the staff mopping the last time I was here), the space is medium size not too big but not too small this place does get extremely crowed during the weekdays (especially lunch time starting from 12 noon to 4pm) so make sure you have spare time if your thinking of ordering something from here cause you will wait. ( I'll share a tip in a bit so you won't have to wait lol) 
       Staff: there all nice, newish since they do fumble a little on some orders. They work fast and always give a smile when you ask them questions or giving them your orders to ring up.
       Food: a very serious negative here within the food: some stuff is either undercooked or not cooked to spec. I'm aware that everyone there is new but guys make sure the food is handled properly because truth be told I have gotten sick eating a burrito from here and I'm not the only one others I know have also gotten sick. Please be very careful on this, make sure there no undercooking going on and everything is cooked to quality. 
      This location is ok. Doesn't really stand out too much and is like any other chipotle place really. 

Final verdict: 
Pros: nice staff, clean seating/ building 
Cons: crowding, under cooked food (meats usually overcooked), cooking not cooked to spec. Prices are pricy (didn't go over this since it's normalize like any other location) 

Judgement: I'll come back for a quick bite but I probably won't be here too much. Save money and time. 4/10 hopefully they read this and work on their errors.",1.0
"So I hate giving bad reviews right off the bat and I decided to give this place another try. I had mofongo con chicharron and it was soooo good. I never knew this place was Dominican until I saw this on the menu. The last time I visited was around closing and the only thing available was chicken and that's what made me sick. This mofongo was delicious, as was the stew gravy and green sauce which was included. For $6, this can't be beat. I look forward to trying some of the other dishes I saw like carne guisada and ox tails. I can't believe I've avoided this restaurant for so many years, I will be back!",1.0

"My friends and I ate here late Jan this year. This review is late because I've recently determined that as consumers, we have the right to speak up when shit (literally) goes awry.

Anyway, the four of us ordered a variety of things including chicken liver mousse, scallops, and brussels sprouts. The sad part is that the food was really good. The brussels sprouts were some of the best I've had and rivaled Alta's. From what I remember, service was good as well. So what went wrong? In the middle of our meal, my friend, who is a chef, starts gaping at a guy who just came out of the kitchen. ""Oh my god, I think thats Clarence!"" Clarence, a pastry chef, used to work with her at her previous job. ""He got fired! He was DISGUSTING. He never cleaned his station, never washed his hands, was completely unsanitary, etc. I can't believe he works here!"" Upon confirming with out waiter that it was in fact Clarence, we all had a good laugh and ended our night after dinner.

Fast forward one day... Three out of four of us were completely sick from food poisoning/stomach virus. I ended up feverish, weak, and had to miss 3 days of work. The review below stating that Manon has a grade C rating does not surprise me at all, and Clarence's presence in the kitchen putting his hands all over everything whilst we were eating dinner is no longer funny.

When we were recovered, I spoke to my friends and we all decided it would be a good idea to get in touch with management just so they were aware of the situation. I went on their website and filled out their ""contract us"" form with a message that basically stated, ""Hey, we dined here on XX date and almost all of us got sick, wanted to let you know in case other patrons also got sick."" I honestly thought I was doing them a favor by letting them know--no demands were made to refund us or anything like that. I never heard back. Seriously, guys? You couldn't respond back with an apology or thank you? Is your customer service run by wild monkeys? Do you simply not give a crap about return customers? Either way, people can how read this review and see what to expect from you.",1.0
"If ever a restaurant needed to go out of business....please let it be Woodland. ASAP. 

I came to Woodland based on a friend's recommendation a month ago for dinner on Saturday. Let's just say I'll never trust that friend's food recc ever again. It was Valentine's Day and All-Star Weekend events were taking place down the street at Barclays Center, so it was pretty busy. I was running late but my friend arrived on time and was told there was about a 30 minute wait. By the time I rolled up 15 minutes had gone by. So we stood outside and chatted. Eventually we went in and told again that the wait would be 20 mins. At that point we had been waiting for 20 minutes already. I saw that there were several tables open so I asked what the hold up was. The hostess informed us that the kitchen was backed up and that we could sit if we wanted but we couldn't order for awhile. Um...okay. It's a Saturday AND a holiday. You didn't think it would get busy tonight?  

Moving on. We sat down and my friend asked for the NON-alcoholic drinks available and decided on a glass of tonic. JUST tonic. 10 minutes later it arrives and my friend (who doesn't drink alcohol) said it tasted funny. I immediately knew the dimwitted waitress must have assumed that she wanted vodka and tonic. It took us another 10 minutes to flag her down to correct the drink order. Then we waited 5 minutes for her to come back, Finally, we ordered our food. We ordered wings as an appetizer; chicken and waffles for me and the branzino for my friend. The wings made us sick to our stomach. They tasted like they were heated up in a microwave. When our food came out, it looked disgusting. My chicken was soaked in grease and the breading was falling off in clumps. It wasn't even pieces of chicken drums or breast, it was tenders curled up in grease. The branzino was mediocre and the side of fries my friend received were cold and soggy. When the bill came we saw that the waitress still charged us for the vodka & tonic. So that took some time to be removed. 

This place should be ashamed to be in business. Neither of our meals sat well with us and I was ready to vomit afterwards. I wanted to warn the people who were walking in as we were leaving. Such a waste of time and money!  You couldn't pay me to eat here again.",1.0
"We didn't have a reservation so I think that was the first problem.  We walked in and the snooty hostess told us she would have a table next to the bar in about ten minutes.  Fifteen minutes later my 12 year old son and I were seated at a small and shaky pub table literally right next to the bar.  There are four such tables.  Ours was directly next to the coatrack and we were constantly disturbed and bumped into by the hostess (who was never off of her phone more than 60 seconds the entire night).  Our ""server"" was the female bartender (Daniella, I think was her name).  She was obviously flustered the entire night. She was also the bartender, bus boy and server for the first floor.  She didn't take our order for 25 minutes.  No water.  No anything.  She finally took our order and brought our drinks back about ten minutes later.  She also brought us some bread, most of which was stale.  It took an eternity for the food to arrive (chicken with mushrooms, a sirloin and fries). After we finished eating we waited for 20 more minutes for the check.  For the price that we paid I would have hoped for a better experience.  My son was happy with his steak but I thought that my chicken was mediocre at best.  I wanted to treat my son to a special meal for his upcoming birthday and was very disappointed.  I won't be returning.  Shame because the place has such a cool history.  It wasn't all the fault of the server as I believe she was more comfortable behind the bar slinging drinks. We tipped her well because I could see that she was struggling.  During the show my son and I started getting rumbling bellies.  Now that we're home both of us are sick to our stomachs.  Not the experience that I wanted for his special day.",1.0
"I went here for a company Christmas dinner party. First impression, beautiful. The view is really something, pretty fancy shmancy. I love the decor of the place, definitely the best part of my whole experience. We were a semi large group, maybe 20 of us. Everything was served family style, but in small portions. I didn't like that. I felt like I was taking too much when in reality it wasn't a lot. I didn't really enjoy the food at all. It kind of tasted funky. I'm a huge fan of Korean, and my taste buds were really confused as to what they were dealing with. There was a chicken dish in particular that I really really did not have a liking for. The beef was too chewy. I don't think I should be chewing on beef like its bubble gum. The service was kind of slow, especially for a big party you would think they would be more attentive. Nonetheless they did keep the booze flowing, which is always great when with coworkers. Here is the worst part- I guess my funky instinct was correct because I got really sick that night and all of the next day. It was really bad. I wouldn't give this place another shot in a smaller group, or ever. I am traumatized.",1.0

Update: Forgive me for not responding within 3 days to an email from a place that got me sick.  I happen to be very busy at work right now. Anyway, I ate there on a Saturday night in March. I felt  I had to write a review after walking by recently and noticing no health grade posted, looking up the history, and being shocked and dismayed - something that Michelle conveniently glosses over.",1.0

"I did take-out a lot last year at this place. But sometimes I would get sick to my stomach. I ordered the same thing every time, so either their ingredients or preparations were inconsistent. I stopped going there because of the aforementioned issue, though I see a lot of people like this place.

"The thing is, there aren't any student-affordable places around in Upper Manhattan (I mean, real meals, healthy meals) and sometimes there isn't enough time to go too far, especially if you're on a 10-20 minutes break between classes.

So, the fact that the food there is overpriced and kinda unhealthy is just...sad. Especially, if you're vegetarian (although I have yo admit, they do have V-options). Some of the dishes just made me feel sick (and I've been some very questionable places, but never felt bad afterwards). 

The food is bad not in terms of taste, but quality - just check a list of ingredients.

They used to have microwaves, but they removed them for some reason (why waste electricity, if one can waste their money on college-offered foods).

"Not too long ago, I started to notice a changed employee attitude...in the hot food section.  There are many buffets springing up in midtown.  Some are a little too expensive; some have tables and some don't (this one doesn't).

But overall, the quality has been uneven.  This particular in-supermarket buffet didn't have seating quarters, but usually had a nice variety of fresh fish I would enjoy in my car while on the job.  If you can't cook - like me - this is the closest thing to home cooking I experience, although my late mother - RIP- was an Old World supremely fine cook.

So I was very disappointed several times in the past few months when the leftovers were clearly re-heated and allowed to stand there in the open, like a festering sore - especially the salmon, with what seemed like pond scum floating in the liquid .  More than once, I had second thoughts when fear overcame me and I threw my entire tray into the garbage can - even food from the green salad section.

I once ate the steamed vegetables that had become one single mass, that the ""attendant"" had been turning over with a spatula, and got the predictable results..big ""D"" diarrhea.  

Yesterday, a ham and cheese sandwich had a  definite ""freshness date""-change - the date was later than on the other heroes, but the bread was near-rock hard, and the ham was dried, clumped, curved, salty and discolored on the edges.  The container of coleslaw was also flat and somewhat gross, whereas it had been tangy and fresh at other times.

"I used to like eating from here back when I was 14 - 15 years old. It's decent pizza to serve in this neighborhood. I never understood what was the big fuzz for this place. It is definitely better than getting dollar pizza or Domino's. The slices are quite huge. However, I'm not a fan of the crust. I never really like leaving food on my plate but when it comes to these slices, I always leave the crust.

Recently, for about a little over a year, whenever I would come here to get a slice, which was never too frequent, I began getting sick. I would have terrible stomach pains and constantly visited the bathroom. I know I am not lactose intolerant and have never had bad reactions to any type of food. So I was always puzzled to what made me sick after eating their slices. I have eaten their ricotta, plain, italian sausage, and pepperoni slices and was never able to pinpoint what made me sick. 

Aside from my experiences, the people here are ok. They seem nice. I don't really know them but they know who I am since the mexican guys know my parents and my brother frequents the place.",1.0
Ate at this place 2 months ago. During our meal my son fell sick and we had to cut our meal short and leave soon.I asked for the check and noticed that for a table for 4 we were charged a 20% tip!!! Never have I known that in any restaurant  one gets charged 20% tip for a table for 4 people. I immed said something to ur waiter but he responded that is the way it is. I should have spoken to the manager but since my son had walked out and was feeling awful I signed the check and left. Called them the next day and was told by the manager that its not fair for other employees as tips are shared and that a refund is not valid. I emailed him a copy of the receipt and called agian but same response that its not fair to other employees. Its been over 2 months and after a few emails I havent heard a word..I advise people to look at their checks carefully.No one even bothered to come up when my son started to choke on his food.I will never step foot again in this establishment.,1.0
"Three years ago, I came here with my boyfriend at the time for dinner. I ordered the shrimp dish and when I tasted it, it tasted like ammonia. I tried a second piece, and again it tasted like ammonia. I asked them to take it back and they said something about how it might be because of the white wine, but I explained that it just tasted like it went bad. They remade it and after tasting the new batch, it was the same thing. I insisted that the cook/manager/whatever he was try it, but I don't think he ever did. I sent it back and was comped the dish.

The next day, I had my first ever bout of seafood poisoning and had to leave work early.

The worst restaurant experience I've ever had. 

I know food, and it doesn't take a trained chef to know that if seafood tastes like ammonia, it's cause it's gone bad. Also, white wine doesn't taste like ammonia. These people know nothing about food and I deeply regret having tried this place out.",1.0

"The first time I ordered from here I got food poisoning. A year later I tried it again but no poisoning this time. The portions are very small and they could seriously use some more seasoning. The tikka masala was just spicy and mostly sauce, the samosa pastry was very thick and the filling was bland, the Garlic Naan was ok but forgettable but the golab jamun was terrible, the dough was too dense and the syrup was just sugar, nothing more just plain sweetness. To make matters worse the delivery person refuses to deliver to my apartment so I have to go meet him. Overall not worth the cost for me.",1.0
This review is back dated to atleast two years ago. I loved this place everyone I cane to NY I and my now wife would go strait here. We would get the sushi pizza and sandwich. Some sushi rolls and our bill for two would always wins up being like 100 or close to it. By the way we only ordered special rolls. But one tone I got like food poisoning and we never went back.

"This is a very late review....I've been to this establishment twice.  First time was a great experience.  The second time was February 2012.  I ordered chicken pad Thai with a ginger ale.  Service was good. All was good till I hot home with food poisoning. How, do I remember the details?  I spent 2 weeks at home recovering from food poisoning and that was the weekend that I would have had a date with my now fiancée who I had to cancel due to this lol I have not been back since then and as much as I liked their atmosphere, I only need one lesson for me to keep clear.",1.0
"First off I am a pizza connoisseur.  I sampled pizza throughout Long Island, New Jersey, Manhattan, and mother land Italy herself.

This place is good...real good.  The tomato sauce excellent and the crust is crunchier than captain crunch cereal straight out of the box.  This is the combination to am award winning slice.

My favorites are the margherita and the chicken tomato slice.  Their plain slice is excellent as well.

Their spaghetti with meatballs is decent- they give you a lot of meatballs and toasted bread which is always nice.  I tried some of their sandwiches and paninis as well, each packed with fresh ingredients and meat.

So why only 4 stars if I've been raving about this place?  Two reasons: first, one time after I ate here I got food poisoning and diarhhead my brains out for about 1.5 weeks.  That wasn't good.
Second, their meat portions/ratio is shrinking fast, and you know I love me some meat.

The next day, I faded hard at the end of the day and endured an unpleasant cleansing of the body (if you catch my drift), thanks to something not being quite right with the food.

"This places food put me in the hospital. I almost died. (read on for the full story.) 


In October 2014 I ordered Zuccini sticks, potato skins, Mashed potatoes and, I'm sure, a couple other things. I don't recall anymore. . Before I got even 1/4 of the way through my mashed potatoes (after eating about 2/3 of the zucchini sticks) I knew something was wrong. The food tasted normal -- it used to be what I would order when I was craving fried food -- but for some reason I was immediately not well. 

For the next 6 hours my body tried everything it could to vomit up the mashed potatoes I had eaten (and it took 6 hours bc that is very physically hard to do). I was doubled over in extreme pain and covered in sweat. I had to bang on my neighbors door very late and beg them to take me to the hospital. I had an extremely severe case of food poisoning. 

One that lead to 4 days of severe intractable vomiting - holding nothing down, fever, severe pain and severe dehydration, and dangerous electrolyte imbalances(I'll come back to this) So much so the hospital was stunned but tests came back and they couldn't deny that it was definitely food poisoning -- and it was definitely from PK's considering it was all that I'd had. On day 5 I was admitted to the hospital because they couldn't get it to stop. 

That night -- the first night in the hospital -- was the worst. I was still vomiting. I wasn't eating / drinking bc everything came back up about 20 fold. (1 ritz cracker produced 2 liters of bile.) and the electrolyte imbalance caused every muscle I had to spasm and stay contracted . . . I couldn't move. It was pinning me to the bed and I seriously thought I was going to die because they had had me on fluids for hire and it clearly hasn't been enough yet.  I was so scared. Thankfully, the great medical team gave me a couple medications that stopped the spasms until my electrolytes could balance out. 

To cut this short (bc the rest of the story is basically me in the hospital waiting on it all to clear my system so that I could eat and keep it down.)

It took a total of 8 days from my ill-fated dinner to my first meal that only barely stayed down. They discharged me with many medications and on a bland diet. I could barely eat. I avoided it. I was terrified to try. Every time I did I would vomit repeatedly. It wasn't safe bc if I did that I'd have to go back to the hospital. They told me they'd readmit me if it happened again -- bc they'd have no choice. 

On day 13 I had a follow up with my doc as I still couldn't eat much at all. To my horror -- I had gone from 107lbs to 84lbs in 10 days. This would have been the second week in November now. Still weak and still so sore. As I write this -- I am still having trouble gaining the wright back from the food poisoning that came from this place. Now. I really hate to leave this kind of a review for any kind of business -- especially one I used to work at (years before and I left in good terms) -- but I 

THE (2nd) WORST part about it? When I called them to let them know what had happened -- they were beyond rude and never did anything to apologize. They wanted my receipt. They wanted to verify I had ordered (which they eventually did) but they did absolutely NOTHING to even to TRY and make it right. 

I have no intention of suing them (as of now) but I most certainly will not be ordering from them considering that I almost died last time. 

I would not be nearly so angry if they had not been so rotten to me on the phone. If they had tried to, in some way, make if right. I spent half a month in agony and TOTALLY miserable, unable to eat and -- at least once --- close to dying because of them and these people didn't even care. Most people would just sue them. I am not most people.  I would have been satisfied and forgiving had they handled this appropriately. Like a responsible business. Like adults. They did no such thing. If they had acknowledged their wrong, and offered SOME WAY to try and make it right - to make it up to me (or try) then I would have lovely things to say about them. But, alas, that's not what they did. 
I was treated HORRIBLY when I called to tell them they had contaminated food. Which I did so that other people didn't get sick. 

I am still struggling with the medical and financial consequences of their negligence. 

Seriously, these people not only got me horribly sick but also treated me me badly but not once did they offer me anything to try and make it right. Had they, then I'd definitely have a lot better things to say. 

I'm sorry, PK, But you just can't put your patrons in the hospital and then just pretend it never happened.",1.0
The service is good. The food was awful. I ordered a quesadilla. The cheese in it was old. The shrimp was from a frozen bag I noticed the cook open. I was sick afterwards.

When they gave me the sandwich, it had cheese so I just left without any food after waiting for 20m. Today was my third and last time at Teleon, I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, lettuce and tomato and the guy put ONE small piece of tomato in the sandwich, which I think is ridiculous, so I asked him for three and he gave me an attitude.

UPDATE - this place was shut down by Dept of Health a few weeks ago for about a week.  No surprise.",1.0
"* This review was for some reason wasn't posted when I wrote it originally on 2012* Great entertainment and atmosphere, but the food was horrible. 
We went for valentine's day special, and we both got sick the day after. 
I called and emailed to complain but the manager (who didn't speak English and needed a translator) didn't think it's their fault as no one else complained.  But we both developed similar symptoms which suggested it was due to the food we had there since we didn't share any other meals. Although they apologized for the situation but still didn't accept it's their food who got us sick.
Bottom line the food is very bad but entertainment, decoration and staff are great.",1.0
"So sorry to report this unfortunate news, but I think it's critcally important for guests to know. I stopped in to eat here this winter in early January 2015. I ordered the chicken gyro, and within 4 hours I had a violent case of food poisoning. The white sauce had a strange taste I had noticed but figured maybe I was used to a different recipe. I had terrible vomiting and was sick for nearly two days afterward.  The nausea almost started within that same half an hour. It was one of the most violent food poisoning experiences I've ever had. Was the chicken not kept at proper temperature? Was the sauce kept at an improper temperature? Was there cross contamination of raw meat and veggies?  Human fluid contamination? I have no idea what caused it, but it's really frightening to know that a restaurant ppl are so excited about and  regard can make guests so ill. I called their corporate office and spoke with an individual who at least apologized, but an apology can't give me back those two days of food poisoning hell I expericed from eating at the Halal guys. Beware and eat safe!",1.0
"i have been eating in this place since they opened, their ""kacchi biryani"" in weekends were the bomb but as time passed by, they started to make money, and the quality of food went downard.... 
i was a huge fan of their kacchi byriani, trust me or not, i used to take the f train from the first stop to almost last stop to get this byriani and garlic naan, about 6 years ago, and now, i live by the resturant and i do not put my foot in the resturant... 
here are the reasons: 
1. they are very cheap when it comes to salad... 
2. they burn their food 
3. their service is only as good as if one of the owner, or their reletive is around (btw, i know them since i have been going there for so long)
4. servers does not know english, you will have a hard time ordering if you do not know bengali
5. here is the kick...... 
we ordered food for 30 people ones and all of us had food poisoning the next day
here is another kick... 
one of my friend who frequently eat there will never touch their kebob again, because he had serious sickness after eating it and than as we examined the kebob, the meat was very old theirfor it furmented and it didn't cook right...",1.0
"I used to love Citarella fresh fish, however, last two times, both my husband and i got sick after we ate fresh halibut, very expensive, grilled at home. The "" fresh"" fish  did not smell well when I brought it home but trusting the source I proceeded and grilled it with olive oil and little garlic. Aftermath was horrendous for both of us.  The same happened few weeks later, after I bought octopus. I wonder why we had gi problems after buying Citarella fish?  What is Citarella doing/not doing with ""fresh  fish?  Of course upon a call to store all was denied. I am not going to Citarella any more.",1.0
I'm gonna keep this one brief! This place was disgusting and expensive for the quality. I've had better sushi from a Fairway supermarket! Most of the sushi I had was just mehh. But then me and my girlfriend bit into some kind of tuna roll we got. We both immediately smelled and tasted old fish! It was so bad that my girlfriend refused to eat sushi from anywhere for about 4 months! We both had stomach aches that evening and diarrhea the next day and we didn't even swallow the rancid pieces. How could they even serve fish like that? And what is wrong with all you yelpers for praising this place? Even the sushi that wasn't rancid wasn't even good! Ugh...,1.0

Last time went there in May got very bed food poisoning ended up in hospital (NYU) with bad case of pancreatitis hospitalized for 6 days.

"DO NOT GO HERE!!! 

If I could give negative infinity, I would. 

Have never had such bad experience in all my world travels. Really pathetic hostess with no manners. Pathetic is not a word. Completely unprofessional attitude. She had no idea of what's a queue and how to seat customers or to talk them. She bypassed us twice to seat someone who had just shown up. They seemed like junkies and offered her something and she made them seated right away. REALLY!!!! 

Last time over 6 months ago when I brought my friend who is from Switzerland here and he developed severe nausea vomiting and diarrhea after eating the food here. Thought it might be just one time thing so wanted to give another try. Pathetic food, grilled chicken was burnt, and spice level was extremely high. Pathetic service by waiters also

"I love the Wholefoods in TriBeCa but this one is just awful.

I've had two incidences here that is a testament to the dramatic difference in the quality of customer service and produce at the Bowery Wholefoods.

Tonight (May 15th, 2015), I was checking out during closing time with well over $100 worth of goods. While I was already in line to pay, an unpleasant middle aged Latin man, whom I presume to be a manager (picture attached), harried and harassed me to go to a register before the lady at the register was even ready.

And then as I paused by the exit merely trying to adjust the weight of the bags by shifting things around, he proceeded to snap at me in a very rude tone, that they needed to lock the doors, and tried to rush me out. I literally needed a minute to adjust things, and apparently that was too long of an inconvenience. I shot him an exasperated look, and he turned to a colleague to say out loud that he didn't care if anyone complained about him, because he would just go back to his old gig. 

Sure, I get that you're itching to leave, but have some decency to be at least cordial to your customers in the *customer service* industry.

Prior to that, about two months before, I had purchased a creme donut from their bakery aisle. I bit into the donut, and I thought parts of it tasted a bit off, but I ate most of it anyways because I'm a sugar fiend. That was the last thing I ate that night and I wound up with FOOD POISONING. My SO and I ate all the same things that day except the donut. Lucky him.

On top of that, I also make my own cappuccino drinks at home, where the quality of the milk is important to create the ideal foam. I typically buy Horizon or Organic Valley as they seem to have the best result, but when I buy any dairy from this particular Wholefoods, including these brands, they fall flat. I think they are storing their dairy produce at a warmer temperature than they should be.

This Wholefoods is also often out of stock and stays that way for weeks or months at time despite requesting for restocking multiple times. It seems some of their managing staff is prone to laziness.

And rudeness.

Avoid this Wholefoods if you can help it and go to another.",1.0
"Tamarind Tribeca used to be my favorite place as I mostly had good time. But lately the quality has gone down and we got food poisoning when we last visited in November. When we contacted the management, they would never call us back. So, we wasted money on food, parking, baby sitter along with a wasted weekend trying to recoup from food poisoning. Horrible customer service!",1.0
"We chose this restaurant for a very special occasion and were extremely disappointed with our whole experience. It was the night of the golden globes and the place was empty - a sign I now realise that we shouldn't have gone in. The menu was rather complicated and the specials on offer were not written anywhere meaning that I solely relied on the waiter to know what was available. I ordered the chicken special from the waiter's list which sounded good but turned out to be a big mistake while my partner got the chicken Parmesan. We also decided to try the meatballs as a first course since there seemed to be all this hype over them. We got some red wine which itself was good, partly because it wasn't made in the restaurant. The meatballs were bland and a disappointment. I have eaten better many a time - trader joe's frozen ones are tastier and cheaper. The main course followed and did not look appetising. I began to dig around my chicken which had been covered in the strangest of sauces very unlike what had been described. It seemed like the Sunday leftovers had been scraped together on top of the chicken to make a meal. At the time, although I was hungry, I didn't feel like eating it and I should have paid more attention to my body's intuition. I got food poisoning for the next 3 days because of it. My partner also suffered from minor food poisoning from her parm so I can only guess that the chicken was off. I left half of my meal on the plate and we tried to get the waiter's attention to pay but he was busy watching the tv. Finally he came over and we were told that we could only pay cash. Luckily a bank was around the corner and so I dashed out leaving my partner alone at the table. After that fiasco, we were finally able to leave. It was a really terrible experience and I am never going there again.",1.0

Why I returned I'm not sure....girls wanted tequila; apparently they limit tables to 30 minutes if you're not buying food.

"Ate here a few months ago with friends on a pretty empty night.   I had the shrimp and vegetable tempura while my other two friends each had the Teriyaki chicken and Salmon.   Kind of regretted what I chose because my tempura was a little too greasy but I did sample my friends meals and they were both pretty good.   All 3 came with choice of soup or salad to start.   Otherwise waiter service was quick and friendly.     

Now for the bad part...I came down with diarrhea the next morning.    Being that this was the last meal I had before getting the runs I can't help but think it was something I ate there.    My friends denied any stomach issues so I guess i'll never know.",1.0
"I've been meaning to write a review of this place for a long time now. This review goes for both the Utica and Flatbush locations. I can't tell all my friends and their friends enough to leave this place the hell alone. I've given C&J's enough chances and each opportunity I give, they fail. I've gotten sick one too many times after eating their food. Their jerk chicken is baked for one and isn't grilled and overall, I tried to live up to ""hood's hype"" and like them but I really can't. 
   First off, customer service sucks, that's honestly nothing new or surprising though. If your local or Caribbean you should know that all Caribbean restaurants staff have nasty attitudes. It's just in their blood. It's nothing new. Lol. 
   Two, or should I say three, four, and five...I've have gotten either food poisoning or found something in my food on more than one occasion. I only order their jerk chicken with rice & peas with the Mac Salad by the way. 
   Their Mac Salad is their signature side dish for those who don't know. I once found a piece of BRILLO PAD in my Mac Salad...yes a piece of BRILLO PAD. Straight turn off. Immediately threw it out. But let's keep in mind that their Mac Salad is always out. Never refrigerated!!! Now Mac Salad is to always stay cold and or kept at a certain temp. They will have a big pan out until it damn near dries up and still serve it to you.
   Then I once found a long strand of hair on my jerk chicken. It was damn near wrapped around the leg of the chicken. Have you tried to pull off a piece of hair from around your chicken leg?! Yes disgusting. 
    Last but not least, I have gotten physically sick after eating their food time after time. It's just not cool. I gave up on C&Js a loooong time ago. You should too.",1.0
"Overall our table was extremely dissatisfied with our meal, especially when considering the price that we paid. I had the misfortune of ordering the Sesame Tuna and it caused me to start off my New Year perpetually in and out of the bathroom with what I would consider food poisoning. Further I know that many of the individuals I ate ordered steak thought that their steaks were too under cooked.  A friend of mine ordered his steak medium and the center of his steak was blue as if it had not even been cooked. I honestly expected better quality food with the brand name that Bobby Vans comes with.

The only aspect of our meal in which we received the quality that I expected was the service from our waitress.  I did not catch her name but she was an enthusiastic waitress from the North Carolina area and our dissatisfaction had nothing to do with the way she handled our table. In fact, she made the meal bearable.

I have consistently reached out to this specific Bobby Vans location in order to let them know of my experience and they have yet to respond (25 days and counting....) Safe to say I will never come back here.",1.0

"This place is absolutely amazing if you're looking to experience the best diet of your life or an excuse to skip work for a few days. 

Been here twice half a year ago and the first time I had no issues. Food is pretty good. The second time, waitress gave me attitude when I told her I didn't like the cocktail. I went with a few friends on a Friday night and they enjoyed the experience but I ordered the ceviche and was miserably puking my brains out the entire weekend. It was the first time I experienced food poisoning at a seemingly reliable restaurant. Sucks because the ceviche was actually decent and I had to puke it all out.

I lost a significant amount of weight probably like 10 pounds so if you're looking for a quick diet because you're going to the beach in a week, you should DEFINITELY order the ceviche. I was able to fit into an old suit that has been a size too small since 2 years ago. 
I was horrified by the experience to the point where I hadn't ordered a dish with ceviche until 6 months later.

"I just went through the craziest/weirdest shit with this place. I order my sushi from SAKE SUSHI, NOT CHIKURIN. I took their number (sake sushi's) off of Seamless and placed my order. When my food arrived, the receipt said Chikurin, so needless to say I was confused. I checked the number and the address off of Seamless again, and both did in fact belong to Sake.

She argued with me on the phone for 10 minutes basically saying that their rolls were better, that it was the same owner, that I shouldn't just write them off, and to take a chance. The whole situation was bizarre, but she ALMOST convinced me....until I pulled their health grade up. Evidently 2 months ago they had mice. When I told her that I did not intend to keep the food because they had mice, she pretty much goes, ""oh who doesn't?!"". I was floored.

And the 10 feet from my bed to the toilet was too far of a distance to handle that I slept on the bathroom floor even though it smelled like a shit vomit bomb had exploded in the air. I'm still too traumatized from eating at fogo de chao to go out for brazilian bbq again (certainly won't be frequenting this particular chain ever again). The next day I called to speak with a manager to report the food poisoning and both the hostess that answered the phone and the manager I spoke with were unempathetic. If a customer calls and said they got food poisoning after eating at your restaurant the next words out of your mouth should be ""i'm very sorry to hear that."" That's not the kind of customer service I received when I called. I was told my meal would be refunded... THAT never happened even after multiple calls to follow-up on said refund.

"The second time we went, the experience was pleasant as well but it was the next day that was not all very pleasant. 

We got food poisoning from here. The seafood we had was not fresh. Like last time, we ordered the shrimps. And this time we also tried the calamari, garlic bread and the Cajun fries. 

The garlic bread we got was not like the picture someone posted here with lots of garlic, it was just your regular store bought garlic bread. 

The Cajun fries was just OK. Some review said they put this garlic mix on top, we didn't get any of that, so I suspect they changed it 

The shrimp was not as tasty or fresh as the last time. And the squid was just OK. The next day, we got very sick from the food. 

It's such a shame,  I really want them to do well. Again the waiters were very friendly. And i felt bad because they didnt have any customers when we were thete. But seafood is gotta be fresh guys",1.0
I have been living on the upper west side for 39 yrs.  Been going to Shun Lee since they opened. I have gotten food poisoning there a few times. I called Henry to tell him and he told me that I am the only one that has ever said that to him. It is quite clear that is not true. People just don't tell them. The food is inconsistent and very expensive. Like my father used to say it's a stiff restaurant. Every time I go online to look at their menu the prices are always higher. The last time I ate there was in January. My friend and her daughter got food poisoning and the tab was over $200. We ate in the cafe too. Don't eat there or have delivery. The only reason why they stay in business is because of the Lincoln Center crowd. The Shun Lee on the East Side is much better. I never order from them anymore. I used to order twice a week. Now maybe once a year. I'm too scared. Is the food going to be good or am I going to get food poisoning again (for the prices to get sick)? I would advise eating at Shun Lee on the East Side. The Upper West Side needs some good Chinese restaurants. I hear that Red Farm on Broadway is excellent. They don't deliver. Too bad.,1.0
"After street bird failed to place an order for take out, we decided to give the place a chance and dine in. 

We were told that it would be a 45 minute wait so we walked around the area until we received a text message telling us our table was ready. We were seated at a make shift table that was impossible to eat at- the table was incredibly low and there wasn't any leg room. Our waiter quickly seated us at a slightly bigger table. The decor consists of loud music, bright lights, and cramped seating areas.

Our waiter was great! However, service does not make up for horrible food. We ordered the Broadway wings, street bird fries, mac and cheese, quarter chicken, and the General ye dish- basically we ordered the entire menu. First off, we were told the General ye chicken was discontinued because of mixed reviews but then the waiter told us that they brought the General ye back last night for a one night only event. He asked the cook if they could 
whip it up for us and he did. We should have passed on the order when he said it was from LaST NIGHT!!! The waiter assured us that it was fresh chicken. 

The wings were cold and tough. I told the waiter and he took it off the bill. Everything did not taste good. All of the chicken was either cold or warm. We were told that the chicken is usually not hot so we asked to speak to the manager. 

The manger was a young woman who looked like she really could care less if we had a bad experience. She said she would talk to the kitchen about the cold food but that was it. She did not try to fix the problem. She offered us dessert but we quickly told her that we didn't want to eat anything else from street bird and that we would never return. She looked unsympathetic. 

To top it all off, I was given a pen that exploded all over my hands while I was signing the bill. Please do NOT go to this place unless you want to get sick from cold chicken. I wish I would have read the yelp reviews because it seems others have experienced cold chicken and the manager just says thank you for the comments as if it is not a serious issue.It is only a matter of time before this place closes because someone will report them to the department of health.

"I had the best ramen at Ippudo Westside that I can remember. It was better than any place in LA, San Fran, or Atlanta. 

I tried their signature ramen: The Shiromaru Hakata Classic. What makes this ramen so good? It's the broth. Their broth is so creamy and porky. Yeah, I can taste the pork bone in it. It's also deep, well seasoned, and comforting. It's probably the best I've tasted in a long time. 

Their noodles are great too. It has that toothy texture and tastes great. Also make sure to get the eggs with it as an additional topping. Also, a nice glass of Sapporo from the tap pairs well with this. 

I found it amusing the non-Japanese staff spoke Japanese. It's like they forced them to learn how to count in Japanese. I think I even heard my white server speak in a fake Japanese accent. Man they are serious about assimilating them.

The chocolate cappuccino  was my favorite, with a brown coffee bean type thing on top, with an amazing Oreoish crust on the outside. The cookies and cream was also yummy, but not as flavorful as the other one.

"La Cheesecake is a College Point institution, it has been around for 30 years and it really does produce quality products at very reasonable prices. The location is off the beaten path and it's mostly a local's spot, unless you drive.

Inside is just a to go counter, but there are these giant ovens in the back, it's nice that everything is made in house, kinda sick of all the mass produced products out there.

The food:

Plain Cheesecake- I guess I should start with this item. I thought the cheesecake was really nice. it was smooth, light, airy and fluffy. I also like the fact that it wasn't too sweet. My only criticism would be that I thought the filling was a tad grainy, but overall a very nice cheesecake.

Chocolate Chip Pecan Square- I thought this was very good, it had awesome crunch on the bottom and had a nice pecan texture, I did find the square to be too sweet, a glass of milk woulda been perfect. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA&select=FFDby9dV_1Kv88w22WHXAg

Crumb Cake- My first bite, I thought it was a tad boring. The more I ate, the more I really liked it. The yellow cake bottom was made really well, it was light, fluffy and moist, the top crumb texture was nicely crunchy. It was basically a really well made coffee cake with powdered sugar on top. It would go great with a cup of coffee. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA&select=iWoJk45JmUt8elKBINCPbA

Apple Crumb Tart- I thought this was good, it had very nice crunchy top but I was so so about the filling. The filling to me was too Mcd's apple pie like. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA&select=fakkAajvLErljzZf-h08lA

Another star because it didn't make me sick...yet.

I've been spoiled by DC food, but that's no excuse for a place to suck this badly.  The last time I had Ethiopian was before I left DC, and I was craving this for a hot minute.
Now, I'm glad that I only spent a minute in this place.

Not worth the time.
Not worth the money.
Not worth my life.

So enough of my banter... Why did this place suck?

The injera was stale, thin, and dry.
The the beef dishes were bland at best.
The vegetable dishes were lacking in flavor.
The best part were the lamb dishes, equal to that of a half-eaten hotdog found on the ground that's been sitting there since last Tuesday. (We came on a Sunday.)

It was all part of the sampler entree, if you must ask, which for the quality of the food was way over priced.  But it's ok.  There's not much variety to Ethiopian restaurants in New York, so I get it.  But I'd rather pour acid down my throat and call it day.

"Relying strictly on Yelp's star rating defintions, I'd give this restaurant 2 stars at best. I ordered just two things for lunch via Seamless: Norikoh Ramen (their signature I presume) and their Pork Belly Yakitori.

Uh so I don't know what the deal was with their Pork Belly, but it was extremely tough and white in color...like we're talking solid white. There weren't any savory fatty chunks anywhere and it made me feel like I was just eating pig's ass instead of pig belly. I mean, if I did, that's fine-- I just want to eat something that's correctly labelled. Anyway, for $2.25 this was extremely small and definitely not worth ordering again.

Now for the ramen-- I don't know how long the noodles had been sitting in the container, but I presume more than the 5 minutes it took to bike up to my office from their current location. The entire chunk of noodles had coalesced into one large, inseparable chunk. I had to let the chunk sit in broth for a whole 5 minutes before it got anywhere close to being ready to eat. It was also the extremely wiry, cheap noodles you can buy in Chinatown for nothing instead of the fuller and larger noodles you usually expect with good ramen. They threw in the usual scallions, bamboo shoots, and what I can only guess are HUGE pieces of ginger. Which is cool if your diner is Asian but what happens if it's some white guy who'd never eaten large chunks of ginger before? Then what? There were also two pieces of meat in there that TASTED like pork but had the consistency of tough and really old brisket...which is just beyond me. I've never had such hard meat in ramen before. The broth was creamy....which was ok but overall none of the flavors paired well together and I will definitely not be ordering from here again.

Oh. And word to the wise-- Yelp should really institute a ""Post 10 Reviews Before They Display Rule"" because I'm sick and tired of being baited by these random users who made their account last month writing reviews for their friends' restaurants.

Avoid. Really bad. My fettucini bolognaise tasted liked dog food. Like another reviewer I felt like vomiting it up. My daughters gnocchi looked like it was soaked in ketchup. Waiter was nice but not worth the 20 percent tip that was automatically added to the bill which was very overpriced for this sort of disgusting food. Also I note many bad reviews but hidden from view - these need to be upfront do that people know not to eat there.,1.0
"Ran out of food. We ordered a pizza and a salad and had to return the salad because it didn't look edible. The pizza was equally as bad but we had to eat before our flight so took our chance. They're extremely under staffed and the restaurant looks like a nice establishment but trust me, it's not. The wait was 45min-60min. I'm really hoping I don't get sick from this food on our flight!!!!",1.0
"Holy smokes, if you're hungry, need delivery and are actually expecting quality food, PLEASE DO NOT call them!!!! I called them at around 5 pm after a strenuous workout badly needing food. I had never ordered from them before but I love Mexican so I thought even if it was sub par the flavor would be good enough. At around 6 pm I started getting worried because even I called 45 minutes after placing the order the young woman that originally took my call calmly informed me that the delivery guy was minutes away. By 6:15 pm I was pretty upset and told the young lady I didn't want to wait any longer (even though, at this point I was upset but starving beyond belief!) After waiting an additional 15 minutes (It's been about an hour and a half for my delivery I finally called feeling defeated. I asked her what I should do. Her answer? ""Umm...I don't know where he is. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say."" That is definitely not the professional way to handle a situation like that. Luckily, at the cusp of me cancelling the delivery guy showed up at my door. When I opened the door happily since I was so hungry I asked nicely, ""Was everything ok?"" He goes, ""Why was I late or something?"" Seriously, bro? Anyway, if that wasn't bad enough I ordered the Cuban Torta and let me tell you...it was cold, the breaded steak was soggy and the meat itself tasted old. I actually threw out because I was worried I'd get sick from it. I am not a picky eater nor am I hard to please with food but this place has inspired me to use my Yelp to warn others of this establishment.",1.0

"OK - Not great. We were there last Saturday around 4:00PM. We had about 10 people and had called ahead for reservations. The place was super loud and very cramped, even by NYC standards. The staff were OK, but not overly helpful. There was a slight language barrier. No table-side guac. You get what you get. The chips tasted stale and out of a bag. The queso app was hot and good, but at the end of the day, just a bunch of melted cheese with some, but not enough flavor. The entrees came two at a time, perhaps a sign of a small kitchen. I had the fajitas. Very light on protein, very heavy on greasy veggies (at $23 I expected a better balance of protein and better technique) the flavor was fine, just a bit heavy. I didn't have anything from the bar, but our friends were not impressed with the margaritas. All in all, a so so experience that I am not anxious to repeat. Thankfully the awesome company we were in saved the dining experience.  

Also very concerned about the hygiene of the serving vessels the chips and tortillas came in. Only partial paper lining and they were not very clean. Looks like they never get run through the steamer or might be too porous to be cleaned. We didn't get sick, but would be interested in measuring the bacteria count on the inside of those baskets and tins.",1.0
"Ordered from osaka today for the first time and I must say it was the worst sushi I have ever had. The spicy tuna roll was not fresh at all. Please look at the picture I posted. The rice was terrible, it was made with frozen mixed vegetables  and the spring rolls had an enormous amount of panko on it , please see picture. Bottom line, I will not be ordering from here ever again. I just hope I don't get sick from the bad tuna.",1.0
"Sick, just sick! A new favorite destined for many repeat visits. Asked the friendly waiter for suggestions and he said the deviled eggs. I hesitated for a minute as I don't like hard boiled eggs, but I'm so happy we went for it. Amazing! Followed it up with the liver mouse and of course, crowned the whole thing with a Pig Out. What an excellent dish! The noodles are fantastic just by themselves, but the pork just makes the whole thing happen by adding just enough salt and savory to the noodles' sweetness. Small space, so just make a reservation and go already.",1.0
"This is my go-to Japanese restaurant in Kips Bay. At first I was put off by the dim lighting (what are you hiding?!) but now I trust them to not give me food poisoning. 

Their dine-in portions are approximately the same size as their takeout. The lunch specials, especially the bento options, are a good value! And FYI, their udon bowls are huuuuge.",1.0
Awesome food! Sick of the deli food in the area and started coming here. Health conscious meals and smoothies as well as good strong fresh coffee all day long!,1.0
I have to say that i have given this place numerous chances but i've always been left dissatisfied. last night i ordered food and the meat was fine and well seasoned but the rice was terrible. at first i didnt notice anything but once i tool a bite the rice was cold and hard. after that first bite i realized the rice also had a foul odor. i quickly threw it away and did not allow my daughter to eat it. im not writing this review because i want to trash the restaurant im just concerned that people could potentially get sick from eating here. needless to say i wont be ordering from here ever again.,1.0
"Best I've ever had considering the prices of the regular rolls and special rolls are not over $11.00. I am a salmon lover and their salmon is always fresh and on point with the amount of fat in it. Every regular roll is 2.75 each. If you buy two special rolls you get the cheaper one half off. Very filling huge rolls. If I come here to have sushi versus if I were to go to a sushi dinner buffet I pay less here with more variety and better quality. The rice is seasoned properly with vinegar and salt. I think I would if I could only order the rice.

I've been ordering from here for a little over 4 years. They started out too expensive for me but quality never gone down but the prices have. Now with all these deals and discounts, it's more worth it than anywhere else without risking having bad sushi. Not bad in a way where you'll get food poisoning but rather it tasting bad because fish or avocado is not fresh or they don't use sushi rice(short grained). The place has been very consistent with my satisfaction. 

If you're sitting down, the atmosphere is good for dating and a group of friends. They have booths for quietness and privacy of customers. There's very polite waitresses that fill your water very often. She will answer all your questions about what's in what roll etc. They take special requests, like for example, in the party tray, I don't like yellowtail and they can leave that out for me. 

If you're getting delivery, it's amazingly quick. Usually whenever I get delivery from ANYWHERE, it's always an hour. I feel like restaurants just take their time with it all the while I'm super hungry. But with Fugu sushi, they usually arrive in the 15-30 minute wait. Longest I've ever waited for 45 minutes but then again I ordered a lot of sushi during lunch hour. I did call to ask where they were at. The front desk answered and told me they were already out and almost there. I thought it was bullshit because I always receive answers like that when I ask where the delivery guy is at. Around 3 minutes later, I get a call from the delivery guy telling me he's outside with my food. I put in special instructions for them to call me because I live in the back of the house and ringing the front door doorbell wouldn't do much for me. The delivery guy is nice, my dog also came outside and was excited to see new people. The delivery guy acted professionally even though it seemed like he was afraid of my dog. He didn't make the situation awkward because of his fear for dogs. My dog is really big. He's 110 lbs white Alaskan malamute. 

I don't like drinking Asian alcohol except for beer but the hot sake here is pretty good. It's oddly sweet and appetizing with the food. It was smooth and didn't burn too much. I'm a light weight and I try not to drink at all or just very little but I forgot that when I was having hot sake here. It didn't taste like alcohol at all. You won't regret it if you order hot sake.",1.0
"I cannot say enough about what Blue Apron has done to my level of cooking enjoyment  and EATING enjoyment at home!  Not to mention, they taught me SKILLs that I have already used in other non-Blue-Apron meals!  And, they give you the recipe cards so, if you were so inclined, you could re-create a favorite dish.  They are incredibly well-priced and their food is locally sourced and organic.  I love exotic and unique dishes and I made Thai food with their ingredients the other night that would pass for authentic, restaurant Thai food!  It is SICK GOOD!  Everything comes portioned out and if you can follow directions, you can make GOURMET food at HOME!  FAST!

Here's what I said after making my very first Blue Apron Meal:  ""OMG! BEST CHICKEN MEAL I HAVE EVER COOKED... EVER! This is sick amazing!!!

"I was always hesitant to visit this restaurant because of the negative reviews and food poison complaints. However, one of my friends recommended it to me and I finally decided to try it out. I'm happy I took the chance because I really have no complaints for this place. I usually go during lunch on the weekdays for $12.75. That's an unbeatable price! The menu consists of a good selection of appetizers, noodles, soups, sushi, rolls, and even free beverages. Yes, the sushi is not that fresh. But if you want fresh sushi, why visit an AYCE joint? You can find quality at authentic Japanese restaurant in Manhattan for $100pp.  Here, you stuff yourself with flavorful stirred fried udon noodles, and a delicious Burning Dragon Roll. 

Shogun Sushi is definitely better than Sake (their main competitor). You don't have to sit elbow to elbow with your neighbors, or deal with bad service. The servers at Shogun, though not exactly friendly, are polite and quick. The interior is surprisingly tasteful and even the food plating nice. 

I've visited about 5-6 times over the last few months. My friends and I walked away without a stomach issues.

"This place had a lot of potential, but I think they still have some kinks to sort out, particularly with the menu. 

Ambiance / decor was nice, although the stools used at the tables are pretty uncomfortable to actually sit in. We weren't sure, upon walking in, whether to seat ourselves or to wait for someone to come by, so we awkwardly stood at the entrance for 5 whole minutes before a server came by and said we could seat ourselves. 

Beer menu: it seemed like there were some good options, and I was really happy to see that they had two sour beers on the menu. 

Food: The food menu was ok and sounded really good, but the execution was poor. We ordered buffalo wings that were not really buffalo wings - they were clearly some sort of chipotle, house-made sauce (which was good!) but not buffalo. A simple fix would just be to modify the menu to reflect this. Portions were not great either.

I ordered the beef burger (which is $14 on the menu, but we were charged $15. It wasn't worth bringing up to the waitress), which came with really delicious fries. The burger itself was small, like shake shack style, and gave me diarrhea, as I found out later that night. TMI? Too bad. My partner ordered the pork sausage, which which was tasty, but came out sad and by itself, sliced on the bias, on its own little cutting board. The sausage should have come on a bun, the housemade ketchup was waaayy too sweet, and what kind of beer hall doesn't have a soft pretzel on the menu? 

Overall - if you come here for a drink, it'll be fine, but avoid ordering food if you can!",1.0
"This restaurant is filthy, I've walked by when they were closing and they mop all the scraps that fall on the ground onto the sidewalk and street, this happens every night!  You can smell the filth as you wait in line to get your food.

"The lady tending the register and frying up our dumplings is a little scary.. but something about her is so representative of this wonderful little gem. 

The place isn't much to look at, with its old looking awning, run down looking stools, and browning quart containers holding disposable chopsticks, scary thoughts like food poisoning definitely crossed my mind when my friend and I stumbled upon this little hole in the wall during lunch.

There were a few people ahead of us when we entered the store and I watched this woman barking at her customers with feelings of bewilderment. Truthfully, I was feeling a little scared. Think Chinese version of the ""soup nazi"" from Seinfeld. 

When it came to my turn to order, I asked her for the vegetable dumplings as sweetly as I could, and to my relief, the transaction was quick and painless. No barking, no attitude. Just an efficient, hard working woman taking my order, handling my change, and cooking up my food. Instantly, I was her fan.

Within 5 minutes, I had my food in hand and was walking out the door ready to eat quite possibly what turned out to be the best dumplings I've ever tasted in my entire life. They were absolutely delicious, especially with the sauce it came with. And best of all, no food poisoning! 

Just goes to show that looks can definitely be deceiving, and sometimes really good things can come from things that appear scary.

Did I also mention how awesome their prices are? Yep, amazing dumplings and amazing prices. Can't get any better than that.",1.0
"I normally don't eat at any places that have either the words ""lucky"", ""yummy"", ""good"", or ""tasty"" as part of their storefront name.

Reason?  

Because more than likely, they don't live up to those descriptive words.  Even worse would be having more than 1 of those above mentioned words in the same storefront name. 

I.E.  Yummy Good.  Translation : You will get diarrhea after eating here.

However, since this place is spanking new as is the rest of the mall it seems I decided to give it a shot.

First thing I glanced at was the ""A"" prominently posted as their most recent health code.

Then, I ordered the beef stew ($6.50) and it was pretty damn good.  I reminisce about Liang's Kitchen because their beef stew was pretty much 5 stars for me but they closed for business for good.  :(

This beef stew was pretty close in quality.  2 kinds of noodles in the same bowl (regular wheat & vegetable).  The beef slices could have been braised slightly better though.  Colorful carrots and bok choy included.  It even came with a small side appetizer dish which included peanuts and semi fermented celery stalks, chopped of course.

The lady taking the orders was very friendly.  Her English isn't as good as some Americanized Chinese places but either point or say the number of the dish you want and you should be fine.

"First and last time here...if I get food poisioning, I am gonna be mad. We order three dishes. Pig blood with leek, water sprouts vegetable and sea bass fish. The food was horrible. The vegetable was not well washed nor cut. The pig blood didn't seem fully cooked and the sea bass. OMG, the fish tank had almost dead fish inside and one fish was sick as it was also about to die. It was already upside down with it's stomach upright. No good. I feel the fishes are infected. When we brought up to the waitress about the fishes in the tank, she said it was fine and that they are all well and will not infect any of the other fishes. This is bullshit. Had we not sat next to the fish tank, they would probably had served and cooked us the infected almost dead fish. Unbelievable... Now I am feeling queasy.... shit. They only get one star from me because I was able to find an outlet near our table and charged my phone. I would never go here again. I so regret it. Ahhhhhh....",1.0
"Came here for a quick dinner stop with my father- should've gone to the other place nearby instead. He ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempura, beef negimaki and seafood udon.

The fish looked like it was a week old- the sushi was dry and unappetizing. The udon looked dry as well, and I didn't finish my sushi because I was worried about food poisoning. The only good part was the mango and sticky rice, which was delicious. Will not come here again for dinner.",1.0
"Terrible, terrible, terrible. The food is so bland. It's absolutely not Mexican food. The guacamole has the consistency of bird diarrhea. How do you mess up something so simple?

Anyway, today, I ordered nachos from them through seamless. I said that I wanted no beans, but I guess the page must have refreshed or something because the instruction didn't go through. When I called to say I didn't want beans, the lady started YELLING at me before I could even finish my sentence! Then, she put another man on the phone and he yelled at me. Needless to say, I didn't get my nachos. Not that the burnt steak they put on them would have tasted good anyway. 

So, don't order from them. If you want real, delicious Mexican food, try El Luchador instead. I would eat that everyday over this garbage.",1.0

 the ramen was delicious as well. the first bite i had tasted like a whole thanksgiving meal. all the best flavors combined in one bite but it needed a little more salt. to me, its really the saltiness of ramen broth that helps cut through the rich flavors so you can keep eating and eating. eventually towards the end of the meal, i started getting not sick but...

Honestly though it isn't as strange as you think, except for the time they had midget porn on the tv, that was a bit different. Their ""signature drink"" is called Ass Juice, and yes you may think that it must be disgusting by the name and that it clearly must taste like ass, but it's honestly not that bad. Lets be real about this if you go to a bar and it has a drink called Ass Juice you probably should order it just out of curiosity.

Flying fish roe

Shrimp tempura roll

Toro

 Raw Scallop

The scallop and flying fish roe were fresh. But the shrimp and toro the most expensive things totaling 20.00 for only a few pieces were horrible. The toro or tuna belly should have three different layers in each piece. Theese people had the cheap cut and charged as if it was top quality. The worst part it was old, at least 5-6 days. The shrimp was old as well  and tasted like it was cooked and re heated. Unsatisfactory to say the least. How could you mess up something so simple is beyond me.

"Really pretty unimpressive.  

The good:  we made an OpenTable reservation on a weekday and were promptly seated.  It was 6 pm and not crowded at all though there was a line when we left an hour later.  The waitress was friendly and efficient, as were the busboys.  This is the only Japanese restaurant around so if you have a hankering for sushi, this is conveniently located.  Prices are pretty good--can't beat $21 for a sushi set.  

The not-so-good:  the food really is average, the kind you would find in Anycity, USA and definitely not in Japan.  We had the garden salad and fried pork gyoza for starters, then two of us split a sushi set and Kansai udon.  The salad was pretty good but everything else was just so-so considering quality and freshness.  Not the kind of place where you're worried about food poisoning from raw fish but you'll likely leave going ""meh"".

Asked us every question possible from the sauce to the noodles, just to make sure we didn't accidentally eat something we didn't want to. I had the miso with tofu and it was wonderful. So fresh and flavorful. I wish I could eat there again right now. 
They also had fantastic fresh squeezed orange juice that made me feel so much better. Really great experience. I'm from Michigan, and I'm back home now, but I hope I can get back to this place someday. :)",1.0
"Came here for lunch on Sunday. I was kinda feeling sick and after reading one review about getting a food poisoning I decided to stick to mostly vegetarian food here. I ordered tom yum soup, avocado salad. My husband got tuna roll , yelp tuna and mackerel. Over all the food was good. Avocado salsa was very fresh and delicious. Tom yum is very spicy but that's what I needed for my throat! Tuna roll, yellowtail tuna and mackerel were fresh and good. The rice used for sushi had a perfect texture. Loved this place. I will go here again.",1.0
"This place is a little out-of-the-way for most people, and it's very small but there is some bar seating. The guy who helped me was really nice! They also take credit cards here which is very helpful. I came around 6 and they still had lots of donuts. 
       Just to start off I want to say I'm not really a donut person, but I've heard a lot about the cool donut flavors and I wanted to try Dough Loco. I asked the server what his favorite donut was, and he said he liked the blood orange because it was tart, but that miso maple was the most popular flavor. I ended up going with the blood orange, though I'm not an orange person either. It was not to my taste. It sort of was reminiscent of a citrus soap to me. Why I ended up with an orange glazed donut when I don't really like donuts or oranges is beyond me! The donuts here are so huge! Very doughy on the inside and a little crunchy/oily on the outside. There is just no way of eating this without feeling shameful, sick, or fat afterwards. It's pretty impossible to finish one, and I ended up throwing mine away because I didn't like it. I don't think I would want to try another flavor because they are just too big. Their product is too large to be a treat, it's like 3/4 of a day's worth of calories. I think the person:donut ratio should be 2:1. Eat at your own risk.",1.0
"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. I hope others will read the bad reviews on here and decide NOT TO FREQUENT THIS PLACE!!!! I purchased a deal from Amazon Local - pay $20 for $40 worth of food. I have never eaten here before but thought I'd give it a try because I love lamb shish kabobs. I walk in and place my order, to go, for two entrees and an appetizer (hummus) that came to near the $40. The guy told me I had to order to the $40, so I ordered another appetizer. Before he started to prepare the order, hr wanted me to pay. Sure, ok, so I give him my credit card. He tells me I need to add a tip to the order BEFORE adding sales tax. I usually don't tip for take out but whatever, I told him I'll pay the tip in cash, not on the card because I'm not paying tax on a tip!! And I told him I'd tip $5-6 once I received the food. He refused my offer and insisted I put it on my card - adding the value on top of the total order!! Isn't thus illegal???  We went back and forth for a few minutes and when he saw I wasn't going to budge, he refused to make my order. He said he didn't think I'd tip after receiving the food. Huh??? I was planning to tip but I guess because I didn't pull out the cash, he didn't believe me, idk?!?!   At this point, I wasn't going to pay the tip in advance out of mere principal. Tips are paid at the end of service and he was lucky I was going to tip at all for a PICK UP ORDER, and $5-6 at that!!!  I didn't want the damn food at this point and called Amazon Local customer service and explained the whole tip fiasco to a shocked representative, who quickly issued me a refund.  It was AFTER this experience that I went onto YELP and read the horrible reviews about this place and this disgusting, unethical, rude man!!! I wish I would have read the reviews first rather than waste my time dealing with this 'business'!! I look at this as a blessing in disguise that he refused to make my order because based on the majority bad reviews of quality of food - AND FOOD POISONING AND MOLD ON FOOD - that others have reported, it's a good thing I didn't eat here!!

"I can only speak for this location. The coffee is horrible and overpriced. I just got an iced coffee this morning; thinking it would be nice a fresh and it was definitely there from last night. It had coffee grains on the bottom and just made me sick to my stomach. A small cup of gross coffee is 3 bucks. I would stay away from their coffee.

On the plus side, the delivery was fast.   Probably because it doesn't take much time to open the container and pour the milk.

"D not order or eat from this place! I ordered and it took 1.5 hours for the food to arrive after they said food would take 15-30 minutes. I called multiple times and the lady working theres said the guy is outside of your apartment... the food took an extra 30 minutes.
Once the food came, the rolls were a mess, falling apart, and the fish tasted gross. I threw half of it out. I wouldn't be surprised if people got sick from the fish. When I called demanding a refund, the manager was rude and said he can not do that and hung up on me! Very unprofessional. 
Bad food and bad management.

"Fatty Crab was the worst experience from start to finish. Made a reservation got a crappy table while two good tables sat unused, the were wrong about the allergenic  ingredients in the food, and then they kicked us out. 

I decided to go there because I really enjoyed dinner there a few years ago. Wow have they gone downhill. 

After making a reservation almost a week in advance, I got there and had been given the worst table in the restaurant. They gave us a tiny 2-seater for 3 people and sat us so close to the door that we had to leave our coats and scarves on throughout dinner, and they wouldn't move us to either of two empty 4-seater tables despite the fact that they were both empty almost the whole time we were there. 

I called in advance to make sure they had gluten free options (I have a celiac and get sick if I eat gluten), and was assured they did. When I asked the waiter what was gluten free on the menu, he told me the wontons and a noodle dish. I asked if those really didn't have flour in them, and was told yes don't worry about it we can make it without nuts or eggs (whaaaaa? That has nothing to do with flour or gluten!). I asked a different person that works there what was gluten free, and he asked the chef who directed me to completely different things on the menu. Thanks for almost making me sick, waiter! 

The food was mediocre. 

About 10 minutes after finishing the meal, the manager came over and asked us to leave since other people were waiting for a table. We had been there for an hour and a half, a relatively short dinner considering it's a sit-down restaurant and it was a Friday night.

I would only recommend dinner here if you want to eat meh food while freezing your *** off, and be kicked out as you've barely finished chewing your last bite. A seriously disappointing experience! Definitely not worth the time or money.",1.0
"Going into this restaurant, my expectations were very low due to the amount of negative reviews on yelp. It is better than what I expected considering the many skewers were $1.25 like from the carts and it is at a sit down place. However the skewers on the carts are tastier in my opinion.  There is a slight language barrier if your mandarin is not proficient but the menu does have English and Chinese on it so you can just point. There is also a server there that knows some English. 

I also ordered the Braised lamb noodle ($6) which consists of round noodles with some chunks of braised lamb which was okay but make sure you mix that stuff around since all the sodium sinks to the bottom. 

If you have the drunkies (drunk munchies) This place is perfect for you.  They don't kick you out if you puke. I went to the bathroom and in the sink, there was chunky meat vomit and some in the toilet also. (It was probably from the neighboring drunk table who couldn't hold their liquor)At least before I decided to pee I saw there was no toilet paper (i guess not having toilet paper is forgivable) and when I asked them for toilet paper, I got that quickly. 

In conclusion, I would not come here again unless I had to. This place is not terrible but there are so MANY BETTER places to eat in Flushing.",1.0
"I have a been a fan of bare burger in Astoria since the day this location opened. The food has consistently been good. The service has always been just as great and friendly as well, extending beyond my expectations.
However my mere rating of 2 stars is from todays experience. I was diagnosed with Celiac disease. In other words I can't have any gluten, and no its not a diet. This is an autoimmune disease that if I am not cautious I can be predisposed to intestinal cancer.
I went to Bareburger after looking up places that are gluten free friendly. I was so excited to learn that I didn't have to avoid this place. I asked the waitress (whom I may say didn't seem to care much), if the fries were gluten free and if the turkey was gluten free. She said ""yeah yeah yeah it is."" I made sure i asked not two but three times, just to make sure I don't get sick. As soon as I got home I felt extremely ill, it is now 5 hours later- and I am still feeling sick. I can't say for sure what had gluten, because easily anything could have been cross contaminated if the cooks didn't take extra precaution, but I get the hunch it was probably the fries. 

I never write Yelp reviews, but I thought that for those with celiac, gluten intolerance, or on a gluten free diet should take extra precaution when heading to Bareburger for a gluten free meal. 
For the first time, I regretted todays lunch meal. :(:( I'd like to say that not even the service was friendly, the waitress dropped of napkins and asked how was everything as she walked by the table to go wait on another table, didn't even stop to make eye contact. so disappointed.",1.0
"On their menu, the Steak and Fries are labeled as gluten free, I also asked the two workers at the bar if the fries were actually gluten free, both said yes. So I ordered the fries as a snack in the afternoon. At dinner I asked again about the fries being gluten free, the waitress checked with the chef and he told her that they were made in the same oil as the fried calamari, which makes them absolutely not gluten free! Even though I informed the manager of the situation, I was not compensated for anything and became sick later, To whoever typed up this menu, it would be quite beneficial for your business to read an article or two on the definition of gluten free. Will NOT be eating here again",1.0
"Have always been a big of this place but tonight they really let me down. Last time I ordered on seamless the manager asked me very nicely to order from their new website because seamless take too much of a cut so I've obliged. Tonight I put in an order for a fried chicken sandwich at 8pm. When it went through the confirmation page said delivery time was 853-953, seamless said 20-35 minutes. So I called in and said listen if it's really going to take that long I have to cancel because I have to leave for the airport at 9, she put me on hold and said the manager said it would take 30 minutes, so I said okay. 9pm rolls around and I call to see where it's at, she says it left a while ago so I think great it's going to be cold and gross. It's already too late so I grab my luggage and start walking out my building and of course there's the delivery guy with only one bag left, he hands it to me. I bring it into my Uber waiting outside. 

I bite into the sandwich and the texture is like nothing I've ever experienced, like I bit right into pure salmonella. It was hard and stringy, after swallowing two bites I realized even though I was starving and headed to JFK where food will cost me three times as much for garbage it was not worth the risk of vomiting my face off during an eleven hour flight.  

Georgia's can be great but they can also try to murder you.",1.0
Came here with girlfriends that had living social deal they had to use. The deal was for two drinks and 18 oysters I believe. The oysters came in some on top of another so grit was in the oysters and some of them looked a bit dried up like they shucked them hours ago. Fortunately I didn't get sick later or anything like that but a deal on oysters seemed too good to be true. They have decent beers and the crowd is pretty young I think like mostly nyu kids.,1.0

Anyway got seated 20 to 30 mins later and realized there was plenty tables upstairs. We ordered empanadas cevice , tacos n burrito but got really sick from either the Margarita mix or the empanadas  and had to leave dinner early. Not sure that I would go back.",1.0
"Ambiance: No music, lighting too low

Service:  kind server, wrote orders on her pad, yet forgot our calamari appetizer. 

Food: 
Wedge Salad- what they lack in creativity makes up for their fresh produce.  Wedge salad tried to be elevated by adding: walnuts, fried onion strips  and highly processed blue cheese dressing.  

Crab Cake Sandwich with fries- loved the fries.  Had to return Luke warm crab cake sandwich- after all, I didn't want to get sick during my flight.   This is the first time I've had to ask to return food.  

3 cheese potato single-- loved the flavors, but had a chunk of semi raw potato.  Flavors made up for it. 

Lacking consistency: our first ginger ale came with a regular straw, next one came with a cocktail straw.  Hmmmm.  I was confused by this. 

Value for the price was not worth it.

"I need to preface this review with first letting everyone know that I have not actually been to this restaurant. This review is based on an experience my wife had at Buddakan after dining there with a large group and it points out the lack of knowledge of the staff rather than quality of food. 

My wife is allergic to mushrooms. She is very good at notifying the servers of this allergy when we go out to dinner, particularly if we are in a ""shared plate"" setting. In this case, she immediately notified the server of her mushroom allergy before being served. They pointed to 2 different types of spring rolls on the menu and told her she could eat one type, but not the other. Another member of the staff came out later on and told her the same thing. They specifically told her it was safe to eat the spring rolls she had in front of her. So she ate them. After she had already eaten one, a third member of the staff came out and said ""Are you the one with the mushroom allergy, because you cannot eat that they are made with mushroom truffle oil"" At this point it was obviously way too late.

My wife wound up paying for a meal that ruined her entire night. She chipped in for her part of the bill and had to go back to her hotel room while everyone else enjoyed a night out for a bachelorette party. On the bright side, ingesting the mushrooms only caused her to projectile vomit all night and she did not have to be rushed to the hospital. 

The ignorance of the staff at Buddakan is inexcusable. Not one, but 2 members of the staff assured her that the food was not made with mushrooms. She spent a lot of money on a meal that made her sick and ruined the rest of her night. 
She contacted the restaurant and explained the situation. Michele E. got back to her and told her she would call her to discuss the situation. That was on March 28th. Today is April 7th and nobody has called back. They obviously do not care about the fact that they could have killed her. At the very least we would like to have our money refunded to us which is something they should have offered to do immediately. Instead they chose to ignore her. So here I am on Yelp voicing my concerns. 

Think twice about eating here, particularly if you have a food allergy because the staff has no idea what ingredients go into their food. It makes me wonder how many vegetarians have unknowingly ingested meat in this establishment after being told the food did not have meat in it. They could very easily kill someone with a peanut allergy as well. The outcome of this situation could have been a lot worse, and very well can be for someone else in the future who is not so lucky. Complete and total FAIL.",1.0
"I've ordered from this restaurant a few times. They make interesting and decent asian fusion food, which is not easily found in the neighborhood, and has definitely challenged my prejudice on asian fusion food. Two dishes I remember particularly are the lion head entree and the dim sum platter. The lion head (meatball), contrasted to the authentic Chinese one, contains more tofu, bean curd and perhaps taro, the kind of ingredients that gives the meatball a softer texture, but the rich, savory and slightly sweet sauce and juice still portrait a delicious and quintessentially Shanghainese flavor. Similarly, though there's a subtle distinction between the dim sums here and the very classical Cantonese ones, the dim sum platter is delicately presented and tasted identically heavenly. The portion of each dish is small, but considering the corresponding lower-than-average price (in my opinion) for such high quality fusion food, it is very fair, and could even be better for people who have small appetite or want to try a variety of dishes. In respect of their delivery service, the delivery minimum is low, and I can tell from my experiences that the delivery time is short. Well, everything about this restaurant is just perfect, no matter if you're craving for fusion food or simply want to have some convenient, affordable, and well-cooked delivery food. 

I usually don't write reviews, but this restaurant is an exception because of the super nice staffs there. I've been sick today, and simply wanted to have some light and hearty food. I called the restaurant to ask if they could make me miso soup without miso but with more tofu, seaweed, and enoki mushrooms in it, as well as vegetable noodle without dark soy sauce. They agreed friendly and assured me the order would arrive fast. In 15-20 mins after I hung up the phone, the soup and the noodle were brought to me, and they were exactly as I had requested--less salty but with more veggies. I can't be more appreciative of the restaurant staffs, and I've indeed felt better after consuming the hot soup. Will definitively try more dishes from this restaurant in the future!!",1.0
"3.5 stars
How many different Little Lamb/Sheep do they have in Flushing? I feel like I lost count ;)

I grew up eating hot pot but the idea of paying to hot pot still confuses me a bit, this is exactly what my mom will say when I tell her I'm going out for hot pot.- why not just buy the ingredients and do it at home? In a way I agree with her, you can pretty much arrange for everything you need for hot pot at home. So when we do go out for hot pot, it's really for the convenience of things. 

Little Lamb Mongolian Hot Pot is located right inside Skyview Mall, right next to Applebees, easy to locate. 

Parking: Skyview Mall got a first 3 hour free promo (afterward it's like 5 bucks or something like that)  and it's pretty easy to find parking even on the weekends. 

Decor and Ambiance: The place is spacious and very clean.  It wasn't too hot or stuffy inside.  There's no individual pots here but at least the table is big and far enough apart so you don't have to listen to the next table blah. Nothing out of the ordinary and very simple but cozy.  Estimate seating to be around 60+

We came to Little Lamb on a Friday night at around 8:30pm and the place was pretty pack.  We waited for about 15 minutes and then got seated.

First thing to order was the soup base- There's always one daredevil in the group so we had to get her the ""Mala"" spicy soup base.  When I say spicy, they don't play here, it's really spicy, this Mala stuff is basically filled with red pepper and the spice lingers in your tongue for a prolong period of time! Really if you can't handle your spice, don't try it!!  
For the rest of us- less daring, we went for the herbal broth, it's filled with a lot of chinese herbs that I wouldn't be able to tell you but it's supposed to be good, so I'll take their words for it ;)

After you got that down, they'll give you a paper to select your meat, veggie, seafood, pastries/noodles and various balls (fishballs, beefballs, squidballs and etc).  I will highly suggest getting the ""Selected Fatty Beef"" here because they are very fresh, have great meat/fat ratio and very thinly sliced. The Flounder Filet was fresh and not slimy and cooks in seconds.  In the Balls department, definitely go for the Fish Roe Filling Balls and the Pork Meatballs, both of them have fillings that are delicious, just be careful when you bite into it, both of my friends burnt their tongue with it. If you are like me, always need carbs, get yourself some Udon, there's a reason behind it, Udon absorbs the broth and making it super flavorful!  Veggie of course is optional ;) but you should try getting some taro, it's delicious!! just make sure to pick it up before it dissolves into the broth.

After you submit your final paper, go at it at the sauces station- Here you'll want to be as creative as possible without causing your stomach to have diarrhea.  My favorite combo will of course be the Shacha sauce, hot chili oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, Sriracha, hefty amount of scallion and minced garlic.  Sure your breath will kick afterward but at least you'll kick it with a happy stomach. One thing I didn't see was eggs, I love the raw egg in the sauce combo but too bad they don't have it. 

Once the food is all there, start cooking your meat and dip them into the sauce! MAKE SURE YOU DON""T OVERCOOK YOUR FATTY BEEF!! They take literally 10 seconds to cook!!!

Service: Not bad, wasn't the friendliest bunch of servers but at least we got our water filled!

Cost: varies- depending on how much your group eats, for the healthy appetite eaters, aim to order around $20 worth of food per person, our group ended up ordering too much and had left over to take home (btw, they'll give you a bag to take all your raw food home)

Overall: Great place for Hotpot, probably one of the better ones in Flushing since it's not super crowded, it's clean, decent service, fresh ingredient and at a good price point.  I'm curious to know what they do over the summer, so I'll plan to visit again during the summer for another review update!",1.0
"Their guacamole is amazing. Can i just say that my waitress tonight, (an older hispanic red head) was the worst waitress ive ever had. I have never had such bad service. All i ordered was rice and beans with no cheese, and i was the only one who didnt have a plate in front of them for TEN MINUTES while my whole table had their plates full of shrimps and steaks...and then when my beans got there they had cheese on them. I told her i had a dairy allergy and she just nodded it off and ive been throwing up and having diarrhea the entire night starting 30 mins after leaving the restaurant, so something i ordered must have had dairy. Had it been any other person they would have pressed charges. Very unprofessional. Also i had to remind her 4 times that i wanted water without ice.

"I've gotten the duck noodle soup a couple times, and I probably won't have it again. The texture of the duck wasn't the juiciest, and the soup was a bit over salted. If you're looking for something quick and something Thai, then look no further, if that's all you're looking for.

If you're looking for good quality, classic American food in New York City, you truly can't go wrong with Burger Heaven.

Speaking of the fries, I don't get the curly fries, I just get the regular fries and they are consistently good, as a matter of fact, all the food here is very consistent. Anyway, usually at restaurants I ask for the fries extra crispy but for here I don't need to because they always come out good without me asking. I think the service here is fine, the food comes out relatively quick, I've never had a server with an attitude, so I have no complaints.  Burger Heaven is always clean, including the bathrooms.

"They are not even trying at this place in Forest Hills.
Their food and carelessness made me physically sick, and I'm still trying to find out from them if it's because they lied to me or didn't know better.
Imagine if you were a diabetic and said no sugar in the iced tea, and they put some in there anyway but told you they didn't. Even imagine if you told them you only like Diet Coke so they gave you something you thought was Diet Coke but later found out that they lied and gave you Diet Pepsi instead...would you want to eat there again?
Well, that's the equivalent of what they did to me. Do NOT go here if you have celiac disease, any food allergies or wish to eat Vegan. The staff repeatedly assured me on 4 separate occasions that their veggie burger was gluten free -- each time, I asked my server, and then asked them to confirm that the burger was gluten free with the restaurant's allergy specialist (every restaurant in NY State is required to have one). They claimed that they did, but now they tell me that the veggie burger is not gluten free.
At least they are now putting that information on their menu, but it's too late: I have celiac disease, and every time I eat gluten, that means a year of nerve damage and another before the damage begins to repair itself, if ever...in addition to other physical damage and painful symptoms. 
Having a new menu that accurately labels the burger is no excuse for the eye-rolling disregard I received from the teenagers who work there, who obviously either pretended to check with the resident allergy specialist, checked with one who knows nothing, or maybe couldn't find one because there is one.",1.0

"For some places in Chinatown, the ""C"" on the window stands for China. I've eaten in some very questionable places in Beijing, and I think only this place rivals that in terms of ""What in the hell am I putting in my body?""

It's way down on Eldridge and in case you ever feel that Prosperity is a little too ""American"" for you, then walk a few blocks down to this small spot somewhat close to the underpass of the Manhattan Bridge. I tried it one day randomly because it looked intriguing and because there was a ""Grade Pending"" sticker in the window, which at least made it seem that they were attempting to be safe.

That was probably fourteen months ago that I first went, and I have to say that I've been back probably 19 or 20 times.

Their dumplings are very good. For $3, you get 10 or 12 of them on a styrofoam plate. You also get a separate small bowl of broth. Their broth isn't as salty as it should be, but it works very well against the dumplings. The dumplings are the best steamed/boiled that I've had in Manhattan's Chinatown. I've had better dumplings in the city, but not for the price or convenience.

Another big thing is that the food is given to you just about as soon as you take a seat. I don't know what this means and I don't want to know. . . but before you can even settle yourself down in a seat and take off you coat, one of their seemingly hundred employees is bringing over your order for you.

Overall, the staff is polite without being hurried or condescending. They always look to me strangely, as if they're confused to why anyone non-Chinese would be in their establishment. This always gives me a little laugh. I have never heard English being spoken either by an employees or a fellow guest. You mostly have to point and gesture to get what you want, but I've never had a problem with that.

I do have to say that in the last few months, they have received a ""C"" grade on their health check-up and if you're worried about that then I would stay away. I've never gotten sick after eating there, but I would be cautious.",1.0
"Let me start by saying that I don't usually eat at Boston Market and I've never given a one star review before. I have never given one star reviews because I've never been at the point where I felt that my health was being compromised due to what I was being served. I ordered a family meal for three which includes a rotisserie chicken and three sides. They have a promotion; for two dollars more you can have either a whole pie, a large soup or a large salad. I chose the large salad. The employee working the counter realized that they were out of lettuce so then he ran into the back to grab a new tub. He then took the tub upfront and reached into the tub and grabbed the lettuce with his gloved hands. These gloves have been on him at least the entire time that I was online which was 20 minutes. Running into the back to grab the lettuce, God knows what he touched and what bacteria was on it! By no means should he have made that by reaching his dirty gloves into the lettuce and then into the shredded cheese and then into the croutons! If I was to eat this I could have gotten sick! I am absolutely disgusted, and I put a complaint in to Boston Market feedback. So gross and most people wouldn't even notice.",1.0
this place is terrible.. i love and know alot about indian food.  If you notice most of the reviews complain about the waiters trying to upsell you and get you to order more. there is a cheap low class vibe about the place and the food is below average and not worth putting up with the place. Last time i went i felt sick afterwards.,1.0
"I have never felt so awful in my life and I've done plenty of juice cleanses. I'm not sure if it was due to the high sugar content of these juices (lots of fruit) or the fact they are non-organic and I try to eat only organic produce. Either way, by the second day I had to leave work early after vomiting in the bathroom. I went home and slept for 3 hours. I finally crawled my way to Whole Foods where I bought egg whites and organic veggies and steamed the veggies per the recommendations on the cleanse. I stopped drinking my remaining juices and feel much better now that all that sugar is out of my system. Going to toss the rest. 
Another con- two of my juices had spoiled by the time I received them. Will definitely not do this cleanse again.",1.0
Food isn't always fresh. Last time I went the roll and sashimi was so fishy I was worried I was going to get sick. Service blows. My friend can also attest to that. But 5$ happy hour and not feeling bad over giving a small tip... Eh. Go somewhere else.,1.0
"I've been to Umami Burger twice. The first time was definitely a lot better, I guess because it was new to me. I would have given this place 5 stars the first time. This review is mostly based on my second visit.

I had the Manly Burger the first time and it was simply delicious. It was devoured within minutes. My friends all loved their burgers. We shared the truffle fries between 3 people and we left wanting more. We sat upstairs, service was great. I had an amazing experience.

Service was slow the second time I was there. It was early evening on a weekday so there were a lot of empty tables. We sat on the first floor. The couple next to us got seated after us, ordered after us, and got their food way before we did. We ordered the same amount of food. 

We got the truffle fries to share between 2 people. This time we couldn't finish them. The truffle flavor got too overwhelming after a while and we got sick of it. We also had the cheesy tots, they were great and I preferred them over the truffle fries. The presentation looked a bit lonely and sad when they came out though. I had half a Manly Burger and half a Truffle Burger. The first few bites were great but I thought it got really salty as I was going through the meal. 

I would not recommend their cocktails, they were just not that great.",1.0
"Quick bite to eat- away from the masses. Clean space with two levels. Good came fast- basic- no frills. Nothing fancy. As we left the nurse in me noticed the GRADE PENDING inspection by DOH. Should be an A, one would hope. Hope I don't get food poisoning. Ugh",1.0
"***QUICK NOTE: I've been to all three Burger Heaven locations and had similar experiences so my review is the same for all three.***

If you're looking for good quality, classic American food in New York City, you truly can't go wrong with Burger Heaven. I've been eating here for years and I don't think I would ever get sick of eating here.  I usually get the grilled cheese which is very good.  There's nothing that's really unique about the grilled cheese, but if you're looking for just good old-fashioned grilled cheese and fries, you've come to the right place. Speaking of the fries, I don't get the curly fries, I just get the regular fries and they are consistently good, as a matter of fact, all the food here is very consistent. Anyway, usually at restaurants I ask for the fries extra crispy but for here I don't need to because they always come out good without me asking. I think the service here is fine, the food comes out relatively quick, I've never had a server with an attitude, so I have no complaints.  Burger Heaven is always clean, including the bathrooms. I highly encourage anyone to give this place a try and with such a big menu, you're bound to find something here that you'll like.",1.0
"It's s quick meal at a low price and takes credit cards. The place is clean. Good to find a McDonalds if you don't know which of the local restaurants are any good. They're consistent, like all McDonalds. They always have an ""A"" inspection rating. If you get sick it was probably germs from the subway pole or something else you ate.

I don't know. Mickey D's gets a bad rap but it is cheap, fast, delicious food. You can see right back into the cooking area, nothing is hidden. Nobody forces you to eat here but you need to eat somewhere. Skip the fries and get a diet soda and you can eat cheap, delicious food quite a lot without expanding your waistline.

They even have a 99¢ ATM inside! Can't beat that unless you are lucky enough to find a branch of your own bank nearby.

I'd say 9 out of 10 meals here are going to be satisfying, about the same as any other restaurant I've found.",1.0
"This place has always been nice - the staff are so friendly and helpful it reminds me why i like neighborhood businesses.  But ever since they have reopened they are trying even harder to have a better selection. Also, I'm medically gluten intolerant - if I eat it i get sick. i used to get my basics here and go elsewhere for my specialty items, but now they have everything I need. Thanks guys!",1.0
"Well I went here for the first time on Friday. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with a nice mix of both Japanese and Spanish decor. The drinks are also good. I'm not a huge fan of sushi but was pleased to see other types of food on the menu. I had the shrimp gyoza with fries. The fries were so good that I ordered another plate of them! There's also a separate bar area for people who just want drinks and no food. 

My reason for not giving 5 stars are as follows: They have unisex bathrooms which I don't like. I personally feel safer when there are designated bathrooms for men and women. The service is extremely slow and takes a long time to get anything. They also need a separate area for the hookah. Children and older people, sick people and pregnant women also have dinner here as well as people who just don't want smoke blowing in their face from every which way! 

In conclusion, I'd go back here but maybe just for drinks at the bar.",1.0

They were Raw inside, you open it up and you can see the blood running.

"Went here with my family after reading the reviews and will never return! I ordered chicken teriyaki and it was grossly undercooked. I told one of the employees and they brought out another dish ten minutes later. Secondly, I ordered a diet coke and my glass was 75% ice and rest diet coke. After drinking the little coke that they gave me, I asked for more. Unbeknown to me, I was being charged $2.00 dollars for every glass they were bringing out. When I looked at my bill, I was charged for 4 diet cokes when I actually consumed one can, they also charged me for the full price of the undercooked poultry that could have left me very sick. Very disappointed in this establishment and I will not visit or recommend to anyone.",1.0
"I never write any reviews, so for me to go on here to give a restaurant a bad review you just must have really annoyed me!  My biggest complain is the absolute lack of customer service and organization at this place. We were seated 30-40 min past our reservation time. We never knew who our actual server was because at least 2 or 3 different people stopped by. The restaurant ran out of beer, and half their inventory of wine (how does that happen on a Sat night in west village)?!! 

At the end, the server asked us to leave the tip in cash for the workers (which is fair), except that he went ahead and charged my credit card 20% anyway. To top it off, we were kindly asked to leave because other people were waiting for tables! 

To be fair, the food was eatable and no one in my group of friends is sick just yet. Will not go back here nor will I ever recommend it to anyone. Try L'Artusi or Malaparte only blocks away with better food, better customer service and overall better experience!",1.0
"Excellent selection! Unfortunately they sell expired meat, so be very careful you don't get sick from their food.",1.0
"I was excited to come here for dinner on a double date but was extremely disappointed, and if I wasn't on a date, I would have made more of a stink. 

I will admit that the cornmeal crusted calamari was delicious, but the meal took a quick turn for the worse when the small plate arrived. The oysters were underwhelming, and the clams that came with it were funky tasting, NOT in a good way (and I spent the rest of the meal hoping I wouldn't get food poisoning from them). 

The waiter apologized for this and ended up taking off something from our bill, but the kicker was the entree -- the ""sloppy"" tacos (blackened cod) -- which had been recommended by the waiter. 

THEY WERE INEDIBLY SALTY. It honestly tasted as if someone had dumped an entire packet of Ramen Soup seasoning onto the taco. The ruined fish was not at all helped by the alleged ""fennel slaw,"" in which I could see or taste no fennel (or perhaps  it was the fact that whatever was in the slaw had been wilted to unidentifiable limpness). 

It honestly seemed like this place was a sham of a restaurant -- what 12 year old chef was in the kitchen? What recipes were they using? Did anybody come here for the food, or do they just use their cute lamps to lure enough clueless chumps to get away with this nonsense?",1.0
"I've read a lot of the reviews here and I couldn't agree more with them.  I tried this place for the first time today, because my brother kept raving about it.  I was totally disappointed.  One of the most common complaints amongst yelpers were the chicken dishes.  I got sesame chicken and it was stale, rubbery, and hard to chew.  I wonder if they're overcooking it, because overcooking chicken... especially drumsticks makes them as unappetizing as overcooked chicken breasts.

I have favored Imperial Work for many years now and their sesame chicken is to die for.  The meat is so moist and chewable.  Plus, their pork fried rice is like the best I have tasted in terms of Americanized Chinese fast food.  Wah Hing Kitchen's pork fried rice was... unique.  It tasted like cardboard and overcooked.  I gave this place 2 stars, because I haven't gotten food poisoning or spotted roaches in my food yet.  

I ordered BBQ spareribs and my goodness... I regret ordering it large.  Why?  I want to throw it away, but it cost me $10.50.  Man.  Maybe I can throw it at the racoons coming out tonight.  Ugh.  Nasty.  The price is expensive too.  I mean for what I bought, it would be $10 cheaper at Imperial Wok, plus when we get orders over $20, we get a free bottle of soda.  Wah Hing offered none.  That's what you call excellent customers service.  

Oh, man.  I haven't really ate much and I feel bad about throwing it away.  I am never ordering from here, ever.  Imperial Work all the way, but I'll tell you this.  I won't even ask you to try out Imperial Wok, because that'd be partisanship.  You can try out other Americanized Chinese venues, but steer clear of this one.  I'm saving you the trouble of a big disappointment and regret.",1.0
"The food is mediocre, the service is bad.
I used to go there sometimes for lunch special purely because it's close to where i work. their dumplings with red oil are NEVER well cooked, one time after my friend and i almost finished the whole dish found out the meat was still raw!!! (covered with a lot sauce couldn't tell). Don't be suprised if you have diarrhea if you eat there. 
Today i went there wanted chinese vegetable, but the waiter told me they have chinese vegetable with scallops. i said, i don't want the scallops just the vegetable please. he said ok. Guess what later he bought us check he charged the disch with scallops! i was like, i said i didn't want the scallops you should only charge the vegetable price. he said, it's your choice you didn't want scallops, but you ordered this dish so is charged with the price with scallops. OMG are you kidding me?? the most expensive part in this dish is the seafood, you didn't give me any seafood and tried to charge me the same amount?? He started to argue with me(yes typical chinese restaurant attitude) and wouldn't change the bill. so i took the difference off the tip. Anyway, it's ridiculous. Will never return.",1.0
"We were lured into this place by the $3 sangria sign outside. The sangria was just ok. However, what wasn't okay was that I could smell the bathroom from my table. I was not able to actually eat there because of the smell. After a couple of glasses of sangria, naturally, I needed to use the restroom. With much reluctance, I decided to relieve myself there. I discovered why it smelled so bad. There is a sign that says do not flush any paper down the toilet and a open (and overflowing) trashcan full of used toilet paper. I nearly vomited. My friends were congested/ not bothered by the smell and were able to eat food while there. I was not impressed by their sandwiches when they arrived and never once had a second thought about deciding to not order food there. I gave two stars because the staff was friendly and prices were very reasonable.",1.0
"I really wanted to like this, I did.  I thought long and hard before I gave this review, but the customer service did it in.

I ordered a groupon for this because I wasn't sure about the ""blended"" juice cleanse.  But I wanted to try it. I paid $39 for same day shipping, so that the juices wouldn't spoil (need to consume within 3 days).  They arrived on time, on the day I chose (yay!). I left work early to get home and put them in the fridge so they would be okay.  When I got home they were in a cute little package with cold packs (still frozen).  They were nice and cold (double yay!).  

The first drink was awful, I gagged drinking it.  Got about 3/4 gone and just threw it out.  I thought maybe it was the Romaine? Stay tuned...

The second drink was yummy (spicy lemonaid..not sure how you could mess that up)

Third drink was okay (sweet spin...very sweet aftertaste).  By the end of this drink I was feeling headachy and ""off"". I described it to my hubby as how I felt when I was pregnant and my blood sugars were too high (gestational diabetes).  I thought maybe it was too carby? (I then checked the nutrition labels and saw how much carbs are in each drink! Holy moly!).  All carbs and no protein...no wonder I was feeling off. Other juice cleanses are more ""green"" I guess? Never had this problem...

Fourth drink was also very sweet (drank about 3/4 and then threw the rest out).

5th drink was where I stopped (not so chunky).  I noticed when I pulled it out that the bottle was ""bloated"" for lack of a better word...thought it was just really full.  Well, when I opened it it bubbled...took a sip and it was FIZZY and fermented tasting.  Immediately dumped it down the drain :(

I thought, maybe this is why I'm feeling bad, or maybe why I didn't like the taste of the others...are they all spoiled?  My husband wouldn't let me drink anymore because he was afraid I was going to get sick.

I wouldn't have written such a poor review, however, I attempted to contact Jus by Julie via their website, and I NEVER HEARD BACK.  I contacted groupon and was very quickly issued a refund/apology for my bad experience. But I have yet to hear from Jus By Julie.  So for that, I will not be trying this again.  I believe that the fact of the matter is...I paid $39 for shipping for same day so it wasn't spoiled...and it was spoiled the first day I drank them, is poor quality control.  On top of the poor customer service (or lack thereof), I do not recommend this company.  

Maybe it would have been good had I tried it again and had NOT gotten spoiled juice, but this experience ruined it for me.  How could they be spoiled that quick if they were actually made that same day? And shipped cold?  It makes me wonder if they were truly ""fresh"" like it states...

Can I add a photo to the review? I can't find how, maybe it isn't possible. But I have a picture of the fizzy/bubbly juice just so people don't think I'm lying. I took pictures, lol.",1.0
This was by far the most overpriced disgusting food I've ever seen. Paid $28 for take out that I opened and tossed straight to trash. Rather waste 28 then risk food poisoning. The salmon sushi looked brownish with fat and salmon skin on it. All the fish was unevenly sliced. Gross....,1.0
"If you are a Freakonomics fan, you should check out Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner's newest book When to Rob a Bank which specifically sites this restaurant.  Basically the gist is that the author ordered the Roast Chicken which was served to him rotten only to find out after it had been returned to the kitchen that the entire shipment was rotted and somehow the chefs didn't notice the rancid smell while preparing it and then placing it on a platter to be served...I mean come on, we've all cooked chicken and not taken the packaging out with the trash soon enough and opened the trashcan to be knocked out by the smell of decaying putrid chicken.  The kicker though...was the horrible managerial service that the authors cited; apparently the manager only comp'd the duo a couple glasses of wine and refused to lower the check.  I think that alone says something about he quality of this establishment.  I'll never eat here.  The next time your having a 'snack' or a relaxed meal here with your cup of Joe, grab a copy of the book and flip towards one of the last chapters and read their excerpt on French Roast.  It's quite enlightening and entertaining to say the least.  As the author says, Bon appetite!  And I am in no way affiliated with the authors or the book, I just laughed out loud when I read the excerpt and had to post for others to take a read about this establishment in the interest of food poisoning prevention and reader enlightenment.",1.0
"Tried to order a sandwich on gluten free bread. I double checked with the waiter to make sure mine was actually GF because the little bite of bread I tried tasted...glutinous. He assured me it was the right bread. 

Much vomiting and a confused phone call later (in an attempt to discern what the bread Id had was and whether my leftovers were poison), it became clear that some error had been made. 

Carnegie is pricey and I went there so I could stock up on delicious Reuben sandwich for a few days as a little treat. No such luck, since they fucked up my order and made me sick. I called to tell them and after they attempted to bully me into admitting it was all a lie, I got several choruses of ""so what do you want us to do?"" 

I could get a refund if I brought the sandwich back, halfway across the city. But no apology or anything from the managers: they seemed pissed Id even bothered to tell them about my experience. 

I've worked in food service before and allergies are a big deal. If a customer of mine had gotten sick, I'd want to know so that I can improve and offer better service. Not Carnegie. 

Dealing with the management was maybe even worse than the vomit caused by their food.",1.0
"Mediocre, but not totally worthless.  We had bun thit nuong cha gio, pho tai, and some summer rolls.  There was no art to the dishes even though things were as expensive as other good Vietnamese places in south Brooklyn.  The bun was simply lettuce, cucumber, noodles, spring rolls, and straight fish sauce.  The pho was not served with any basil, pepper, or anything.  Peanut sauce was bad, but not horrible.  Cafe sua was horrific (seriously, *do not* order that).  But the summer rolls were good, and none of the food was inedible (except the coffee).  

 Other than that, I'm pretty sure that the people who worked there did not speak a lick of Vietnamese, or have ever eaten much of the cuisine.  They had no chicken left on the menu.  Water was served warm in Styrofoam 6 oz cups.  The condiments on the table were filthy as were the tables and floor (thank you baby wipes!)  The pho noodles had been overcooked and were falling apart.  I guess the upside is that no one got food poisoning.",1.0

"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!

21 Club is supposed to be an institution in Manhattan but their lackluster food and poor service instantly made me regret coming here for restaurant week lunch. My husband and I arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation and were promptly ignored by an amazingly obnoxious maitre d, that is until 5 minutes had passed at which point he decided to look us up and down (I guess that was his way of assessing whether or not we fit the restaurant's dress code - in hindsight I wish we hand't so we could spend our lunch money elsewhere) and showed us to our table.

We were then ""greeted"" by our waiter who seemed rushed and was quite rude. For the first course I had the crab and salmon tartare. Small portion and FISHY - you could smell it on its way to the table. I forced a bite down before I threw in the towel - I didn't want to risk getting food poisoning. The Short Rib was terribly bland. It was way over cooked, very dry and again of a very small portion. For dessert I had the caramel banana sundae - the only highlight of the meal but really, anyone can make a sundae. 

The meal and waitstaff both left much to be desired. In summary, 21 Club offers small portions of poor food served by pretentious waiters in a dated atmosphere. I find myself wondering how the 21 Club remains in business but I guess that they capitalize on their reputation.

"I have been a fan of Num Pang since it opened on the north side of 12th Street with catfish my sandwich of choice.  I would have easily rated it 5 stars for the great bread, great catfish, all-round great sandwich, efficient and friendly operation despite the long lines.

But the reopened Num Pang on the south side of 12th Street has been disappointing.  The cat fish sandwich is much smaller than it used to be--although the person at the counter denied that they had reduced the size of the catfish.  It is no longer a sufficient amount for a lunch.  In reading some of the other reviews I have seen complaints that other sandwiches do not have enough of the main ingredient, and unfortunately I saw that one customer became sick after eating the catfish.

If these reviews are monitored by Num Pang, I would like to know the following things: 1) did the restaurant change hands when it moved across the street?  the vibe feels very different and I don't recognize any of the staff, not that that is a problem, just curious; 2) what is a problem is the tiny portion of catfish in the sandwich, noticeably less than it had been before; I imagine this was done in order not to raise the price of the sandwich; I personally would have preferred retaining the same amount of catfish and noting that it was necessary to raise the price modestly in order to do that.  I would appreciate an honest acknowledgment that the portion of catfish (and perhaps pork belly and others as well) has been reduced.

"The food tasted good going down. Delicious! Four stars. Tender meat, nicely seasoned curry, if a bit one-note. 

However, they did not give me a gluten free wrap, despite my paying extra for GF and telling them about my allergy.

Food was not particularly delicious when I was vomiting for hours later and writhing on the bathroom floor. 

I didn't call them to work out the issue, so I don't know how their service was about it. I have never experienced such violent gluten poisoning (which just speaks to the amount of gluten ingested, not the quality of the food otherwise), so I was too wiped-out the next day to attempt explaining what happened. I figure that now, a couple weeks later, I owe it to the celiac nation to warn: AVOID. Unless you personally watch them prepare your food, this place cannot be trusted.",1.0
"An awful experience that was minimally improved by the service. 

The appetizer: The porridge served was not only cold, but also had that weird about-to-go-sour taste to it. 
The entrée: For $100, my family and I expected the sashimi to be fresh, firm, and cool. Instead, we got soggy leftovers that left us praying for protection against food poisoning. 

When we complained about the terrible food, the owner of the restaurant tried to make it up to us by preparing new bowls of porridge and providing us with two free rolls (california and salmon/mango). Both were much fresher than the original dishes. 

But get this. Just as our moods were improving, the owner's pet chihuahua escaped from its cage and started running around the restaurant! At one point, it nestled in between our feet at the bottom of our table while the waitress frantically called its name. Really surreal and also pretty gross. Tip to the owner: keep your pet at HOME. 

Other than the food, the service was good, as the staff was attentive to our needs and complaints. Would have added another star, but the dog is unforgivable.",1.0

"Brought my friend here who was visiting from out of town. This was the first time I've ever eaten at a Bareburger, I usually order online. We ordered the apple walnut salad and the panko crusted chicken fingers to start. Let me just say, I don't eat salads and my friend made me order and eat it as it was technically my first salad ever. I did not like the chicken fingers at all, there's no particular reason, I just thought they were gross. 

For burgers, I ordered the original burger with fries and my friend had ordered the lamb burger. For some reason the food here wasn't as good as when I order it online from the East Village location. It was kind of busy and I had to keep looking for our waiter so that we could ask for the check. Later that night my friend started feeling really sick which followed him through the next two days.  The lamb burger was the most recent thing he had eaten that day so we figured it must have been the lamb burger.",1.0
"I know some people would get rafiq'd out if they got sick from a cart, but for me it comes and goes, it passes and then it's over. I can't be sure it was this that did it, and it happens every now and again because I try so much food, so I'm not going to act like it's some Halloween Rafiq Show and tell horror stories about it. You could probably get sick from any place, and the other Rafiq's haven't had that effect on me, so I'm assuming it was just a one-off. Hopefully. Sometimes this greasy sort of food can go right through you, and... I'm not really selling the place very well am I? Damn.

What to get: Combo with all the sauces - no salad
What else: This food made me sick (I think), but cart food often has that effect so I'll let it slide.

I have tried four or five different Rafiqi's locations and I've had similar experiences at all of them, with a couple of notable exceptions.

(a) One time this particular cart in Koreatown made me really sick, but the food still tasted great and Cart food tends to go right through me anyway, so I'm not going to downgrade their star level for this. I know other people would.
(b) One time the cart at Union Square tasted absolutely awful.

Despite that, the Union Square location is my fave. But this review is about the one in Koreatown, which was - I think - the third one I visited overall, so let's focus on that.

This particular Rafiqi's is pretty standard. Service is fast and not particularly friendly, nor is it unfriendly. The guy that served me was just quiet. It seems like an average Rafiqi's Cart. It's not as popular as the Midtown one I reviewed. Halal Guys and Biryani Cart get more business (and rightly so, in the case of Biryani), but if you want to sample all the best of NYC street meat, you have to give one of the Rafiqi's a try. Perhaps skip this one based on me getting sick, but I'm fairly confident that won't happen to you.

From this particular location I ordered the combo (which is gyro meat and chicken, with rice, covered in sauces). I had yet to learn my lesson, and I got it just the way it comes, which is with Salad. If you get it, I recommend skipping the Salad, which is often a little old and nondescript anyway. The salad tends to go bad if you save some of the food for later, and besides, it's next to all the piping hot stuff so it kind of gets weird quickly, and doesn't microwave well at all. Not that I like to microwave stuff, but how else are you going to re-heat a combo?

I think it's pretty awesome that the guy has a huge Rafiqi's empire and so many trucks all over Manhattan. I wonder when (if?) he's going to expand into the other boroughs. According to my notes I have tried 5 Rafiqi's total, but there are about 15 of them... it really is an empire. I like to try different locations so that I can decide which ones are better, if any. So you can look forward to reviews of the others at some point.

By the way if you're willing to venture out of Manhattan, then you must go to Sammy's Halal in Queens. But if not, then try Halal Guys (the famous one), Chicken Tikka at Biryani Cart (my fave by far in Womanhattan), and any of the Rafiqi's too.

And if the only people that ate here were nerdy types, then it'd be Rafiqi's & Geeks.",1.0
"This place is disgusting dirty...dirty towels on the floor and dirty laundry sitting on the bench behind my table.  The bowls were dirty, so I sent it back. Everything was dirty from top to bottom. I did not eat my food once it came out because it smelled sour and tasted foul.  I did not want them to bring me anything else because I did not want to get food poisoning. No one else at my table liked their food but they were so hungry they ate it anyway. I wish I took pictures of everything, but I was so turned off I just wanted to get out of there. Once I finally did leave, I was chased down by the waiter lady asking for a bigger tip. I was so disgusted and offended that I lost my appetite for the entire day. I will never eat in New York Chinatown ever again after this experience.  State health inspection should take a second look at this place and not turn a blind eye!",1.0
"Unpleasant shopping experience. They sold me an expired wrap, refused to return my money (they have an exchange-only policy but should have made an exception for returning food a week past its sell-by date), and did not apologize. When I pointed out that they hadn't said sorry yet and that I could have gotten food poisoning, their response was, ""That's fine."" Also, once I agreed to use store credit, I asked for a reminder of the wrap's cost, and the store clerk said unhelpfully, ""Check your receipt.""

"Having gotten sick and puking on the train to NYC, I needed a resting spot and wasn't sure what was open in the city so early in the morning with no coffee shops in sight.

Thank heavens for this McDonald's which was my AM solace. The crew member who took my order was friendly and nice, when all I could stomach was orange juice. He gave me the OJ and a cup of tap fountain water in a biodegradable plastic bag -- strange, until you realize that they don't use cardboard cup holders in NYC but bags with dividers inside instead.

I proceeded upstairs into the dining room where it was filled with people. Free wi-fi and a space to rest. They have a posted 20-minute no-loitering limit but no workers hassled me despite my having my laptop out, thank goodness. I could tell that lots of other people there had the same idea and were just using the space to rest.

Just another example of how McDonald's always makes me feel at home.",1.0
"I want to begin my review by saying how happy I am that this is coming to the West Coast and that I really hope it doesn't suck compared to the original. The Halal Guys sells amazingly delicious food for only $7 in the absurdly expensive land of New York City, and even though the spicy sauce gave me fiery diarrhea hours later, I regret nothing.

I had my first Halal Guys chicken and rice bowl on a freezing night near Times Square. The steam and smells coming from the cart were basically beckoning me to come over and give them my money. I ordered a chicken and rice bowl, shamelessly took a picture of the guy dishing my food (and got laughed at for it), took my food into a nearby cafe, and ate my food in blissful peace.

The chicken itself is flavorful, and the rice is fluffy and delicious. White sauce and a very, VERY small amount of spicy red sauce are a must. I'm warning you that the spicy sauce is super spicy, and this is coming from a guy who loves spicy food.

Man, I miss NYC...",1.0
"Please be careful with their food.

We have ordered from Cafe Daniellos many times, and the food was fine.
Today the food that we ordered from Cafe Daniellos was spoiled / sour.

I ordered pasta in meatsauce, the second i opened it up i noticed a strange sour smell. It smelt like vomit, so i didnt eat the food i just threw it away.

Then other people in our office complained about the food they ate, mostly shrimp dishes, saying that they tasted sour. And they threw out their food as well.

I called the place to notify them that they are selling bad food and to be careful because people can get food poisoning, but all they did was deny it and say that they used fresh food, asking us if we wanted a new delivery but we respectively declined.",1.0
"I ordered from P.S. Burger tonight and I haven't been so disappointed in a take out order in a long time. I am extremely wary of food poisoning so whenever I order burgers from somewhere for the first time, I get them cooked medium. My food arrived in the time frame allotted which was the only positive thing I can say. The fries were pretty soggy for some reason, but it was the burger that grossed me out. I took a bite only to discover the inside was bright red! I wouldn't have eaten it if I had cooked it myself, it looked completely raw. I called the restaurant and they said they'd send another and to expect it in 40 mins. I wasn't thrilled about the timing but I figured better late than never. An HOUR later I called to find out if it was on its way (my original order was placed almost two hours ago at this point so I was starving) and the girl I talked to told me they hadn't made the replacement... I am now waiting to see if they come through this time although I am not feeling optimistic. 

I have to say, I've been to the Mineola location and its 100x better.

"Horrible. That's about as clever as I'm willing to be for this place. Called for a delivery and order arroz con pollo, and 5 empanadas. We were staying in a hotel 10 minutes from the restaurant, be we still understood it may take a bit. 

An hour and a half later I called the restaurant to see where my order was, only to be put on hold. But her version of hold was putting the phone down while she talked to her boyfriend on her cell phone, and I got to hear every word of her conversation. It was riveting stuff. 

10 minutes later, after she and her boyfriend decided who would hang up first, she hung up and finally got to us. She said the food was coming, which we knew would be the only response we would get at that point. 


The food showed up 20 minutes later and the delivery guy was incredibly rude. He took my card and wrote down the information then would not give it back to me. He said I had to sign the receipt which is fine, but would not give me back my card until I did so. As my personal property, he had no right to hang onto it and give me unwarranted attitude when I asked for it back. 

After signing and getting my card back, I took my receipt and walked away, only to be chased down by the delivery boy who was yelling at me, demanding I give him back his receipt. I had given him the signed copy and took the second copy but apparently both are his and I don't get a receipt. That totally makes sense to me.

Empanadas were tolerable and the arroz con pollo was a mess. The Maduros were shameful, and only 3 slices were given with the 13$ meal. I am not a small child. 

Within an hour of eating the food, I had horrible stomach pains and got sick. I felt that was the only appropriate way to end my experience with EM.

"If I could I'd give this place 6 stars for the service, I would. I have never met such honest and nice people in the restaurant industry until I stepped foot into Wafels & Dinges.

On a Sunday morning, I believe my group was one of the first patrons here at 9:30am. We shared a bbq pulled pork savory wafel along with the wake up, grumpy wafel, maple latte, affogato, speculoos and Choc-Claude Van Damme ice cream. 

Honestly the food gets 3 - 3.5 stars from me, it's not the best thing I've had but not awful. So why am I giving this place 5 stars? 

When I sat down with all my food, I was about to eat my wake up, grumpy wafel which is an egg with bacon sandwiched between 2 wafels. However a staff member came up to me and said "" Sorry, can we swap your plate? We noticed the wafel's a bit burnt and we don't want you to eat bitter food."" 

I honestly didn't even notice it was burnt, but I let her change it anyways. The moment she took it away, it was immediately replaced. This happened in a matter of seconds, how did they cook so darn fast?! 

I didn't put much thought to it and decided to continue eating. Minutes later, they came back again and said they ""I'm so sorry, I just noticed the wafel is still a bit burnt, is it okay if i replace it again? I'm so sorry for the inconvenience."" 

Baffled, I didn't see anything burnt, but I let them swap it anyways. Another staff member apologized and said "" Sorry we claim for perfection and we want the best for our consumers."" 

I continued to eat the rest of the food I ordered, but they came to our table again to give us an entire bbq pulled pork wafel for free along with free chocolate covered wafels. They said it was to apologize for all the inconvenience they put us through. 

Seriously I've never seen this level of impeccable customer service. Usually it's a consumer running to the server or cook that the food is not edible or passable yet it is the other way around here. This level of service I would expect from an upscale restaurant but here we are at a wafel shop and these people strive to better themselves. 

Now a more focused breakdown on the food:

The bbq pulled pork actually became a regret for me because the sauce was too heavy and too sweet for my taste. I got sick of it after a few bites. The wafel wasn't really crunchy and it became kind of soggy from the sauce. Plus waking up to pulled pork for breakfast isn't really the ideal. I should've gone with their salmon wafels.

The wake me up grumpy wafel was kind of like an egg's benedict dish for me just without the sauce. I prefer the wafels used in this dish compared to the bbq pulled pork. It was a nice light dish. 

The maple latte, I didn't taste any maple flavor?? Their latte art needs some work. 

The affogato was alright, not sure if I didn't eat it quick enough but there was too much coffee and not enough ice cream. 

The chocolate covered wafels were okay, I wish it was served hot. I couldn't tell the difference between the three even though one had walnuts or pecans, one was plain  chocolate and one had speculoos powder over it. 

The speculoos ice cream was my favorite over the Choc-Claude Van Damme. 

I would recommend getting anything speculoos flavored from here. 

P.S. If you're confused by the ordering system, you order first and then pay and tip before you sit. (I was a bit confused on why tip was charged when I didn't have any waiters or servers and I was pretty much picking up the food myself from the counter.)",1.0

"So I have had many other baked Momofuku products and have always been delighted, but today I decided to step into new territory and try something more in tune with this warm weather we have been having... so I purchased a cereal milk milkshake. 
I have to say, I was flabbergasted when I came on to Yelp to see so MANY pleasant reviews about this item. One reviewer mentioned this milkshake tasting like childhood and I would have to agree. This milkshake tastes like everything wrong with childhood from spoiled milk to vomitting all over yourself with cereal crunch that hasn't been bodily processed yet. I am so very much upset and feel that paying 7.08 for such a small size horrendous drink is ridiculous. Actually, maybe it was more compassionate on their end. I shouldn't want to spend that much on something I can virtually get for free at any Chuck E. Cheese after a child has been sick.

Only good for drinks.

DO NOT ORDER BEEF RIBS. Ive had these at Times Square, but here they were more like beef bones at the UES Location. No meat what so ever, mostly fat and tendons. IT WAS DISGUSTING. I told the manager about it and he apologized and got me new ones (took 30 mins) -  i was already done with my meal and lost my appetite, asked for the check by the time i got a new order.  He went on to explain they were all the same and got me new ones from 'downstairs' - they were worse off than my original order.  Just pure garbage.   I left immediately and felt sick to my stomach all night. VERY DISAPPOINTED.

Suffice to say, both manager and server were nice.  They are great at taking and bringing orders, friendly and polite, but they take forever to give the check.

"Be warned! Their burgers are dangerously undercooked. They don't care what they give you. All they need to do is pay their rent. Really, this is a NYC problem in general. Some restaurants can handle the desperation. This one survives by jacking its prices and quickly preparing undercooked food. A cheeseburger, fries and one beer = 23 dollars. You want two tiny appetizers as well? Add another $30. Never going back here. One and done. The food poisoning people complain about from this place is most likely from the undercooked burgers.

"My wife and I came here because it's convenient located to where we live.  There is street parking, which isn't too hard to find.  There are other businesses around, such as a supermarket, so you can perhaps go food shopping right afterwards.  

I like that the restaurant is small and it does appear to family owned, so you know that the day to day operations and food should be fairly consistent.  We have come here a few times now, and the food is authentic Cantonese style.  We do like the food.  My wife really likes the chicken here, until our most recent visit.  She usually orders a chicken dish and her preference is chicken back.  They are usually accommodating, which is great because I'm sure a bigger restaurant would care about your request.

After eating majority of her dish, she then realizes that the chicken meat on the bone is very red.  The chicken here is not fully cooked.  I understand that it's a consumers responsibility to know what they're eating, but you would think chicken is fully cooked!  Isn't it the job of the restaurant to double check that?  You usually see food warnings about raw food for beef, fish, etc.  But never do they mention chicken because its always fully cooked in all the restaurants you go to!  My wife was scared, because as we all know, eating raw chicken might give you food poisoning.  Boy, she was scared.  There was nothing the restaurant was willing to do and they simply said sorry.   

Well, they should be sorry, because I will not come back here anymore.  Although the service was on par, the food wasn't.  They should be consistent and double check that their foods are up to standard.  I suggest standing clear from this restaurant, unless you want to put yourself at risk in getting sick.",1.0

"First...this place isn't really ramen. This place is definitely a twist on the concept; it's an interesting twist (or fusion, call it whatever you want), but if you're looking for real ramen here you'll be disappointed.

Anyway, we came here with a group of 4 around 7:15 on a Saturday (yes, I came with another reviewer). We were seated after about 10 minutes of waiting. What was weird was that we weren't shown a table, they just told us to sit there (we had two choices and we elected to sit away from the door) if we wanted to. Then we were told for our group of 4 that there were only two menus available. Okay...it was definitely crowded but I imagine most restaurants would have a one-menu-per-customer setup. But sure, understandable in a way. It's not like this restaurant's been open for the past year or more.

We ordered the edamame which was standard (if they somehow messed that up I would've left) and some special Korean pancake with artichokes and bleu cheese which tasted pretty good. The sauce was a bit tart but I guess it complemented everything well. Again, I wouldn't call any of this food ""authentic"", but for what it was, it was pretty good.

What happened next probably docked two stars for me. Every ramen shop I've been to, good or bad, usually had our orders ready within 10-15 minutes. After all, the broth is always ready, the mix-ins are usually right there, and the noodles take minutes to boil. We waited an incredibly long time for the food to come. I don't want to exaggerate, but it must have been a solid 45 minutes. And let's be honest, even the tastiest ramen is essentially just comfort fast food, so I'm not giving them the whole ""they make their dishes from scratch"" excuse here. They were definitely undermanned with 2 wait staff and 2 cooks. The host had to come over and help every now and then. I'm not sure if this is the norm when it's packed but it was very frustrating. Even water had to be asked for by flagging them down. 

The waiters kept passing by, and they occasionally looked at us, then looked away. A simple, ""sorry we're a little backed up in the kitchen right now"", or simply refilling our water without us flagging them down would've made the waiting more bearable! I mean, it's obvious that your customers finished their appetizers half an hour ago and still haven't gotten their meals yet, right? They run a small shop, it's not like we're being lost in a sea of customers. It got to a point where we were just audibly joking about their lack of service. Finally, we flagged someone down and politely asked when we could expect our food. He indifferently replied, ""they're making it now"". Well, they came out a few minutes later. Success?

On to the food. I had the green curry ramen with extra chashu and boiled egg as I usually enjoy spicy foods. It...most definitely wasn't ramen; I'm pretty certain they were serving egg noodles. They were a bit stingy on the broth; every other place I've been to usually had far more broth than noodle and my friend had to ask for extra. There were salad greens in it...which was weird. I ate first separately first (no salad in my ramen, thanks). Finally, the extra chashu netted me...4 total pieces. But the boiled egg was done well. Oh, and there was a tiny shrimp! And the presentation was nice, I guess.

How did it taste? Not bad, all things considered! The lack of broth made mixing a bit tough, so I gave up and ate it by assembling individual pieces on my trusty soup spoon. The red chili pepper flakes were a nice touch and there was a very good kick that even those who don't eat spicy foods would enjoy. There was definitely a mix of miso/curry flavor in there that works better than it sounds. My girlfriend got some cold dipping ramen, which wasn't bad either. The broth for that is closer to the traditional miso-style I'm accustomed to.

Now the price of this place? Bah. Terrible. The green curry ramen was $15 + $2 for the extra chashu (the amount I ended up with is probably about what most shops give you normally) + $1.50 for a boiled egg. So that's $18.50. Probably the most expensive ""ramen"" I've ever had.

So, the food tasted good. The service was poor. And the price wasn't favorable, especially considering that I could've had two trays of xiaolongbao down the block for the same price! Throw all that together and you get 2 stars. Bottom line, if you're looking for real ramen, this place doesn't have it, and I'm not sure the service I experienced is worth trying their take on it. I'd recommend this place if you're sick of Chinese food in Chinatown, can't make a trip elsewhere via subway, and want to try something different that vaguely kind of is ramen. And can afford to potentially wait a while. If that's the case, go for it.",0.0
"Crush is up there with Flatiron Wine and Astor Wines as one of the best wine shops in the entire city. This is the place you go when you need to find a bottle for a BYOB birthday at Peking Duck House (a sick vintage of Spätlese from a strong producer, duh). This is the place you go to when you want minimalist, gorgeous glassware (Zalto) so you can pretend to be an adult when you have friends over and open a bottle (as an aside, damn you Aldo Sohm for tripling the popularity of these. Now we have to wait for Ryan Sutton to make some eager comment about them so they stop being cool with the tools again.). But this is also the place you go when you want some Savennières or Chablis but don't want to break the bank. For in spite of the fact that at the high end (grand cru Burgundy, cult Champagnes) Crush crushes it, they also thoughtful curate at the $20 - $25 level. From Beaujolais to the eccentric Jura, Crush is also a wine shop where you can feel comfortable asking the staff for help or recommendations without feeling like 1) they don't actually know very much themselves or 2) that they know too much to translate for some plebian - aka you. I've come and simply asked for a Vouvray, no other context given, and was guided to a wonderful wine through thoughtful, genuine questions. I've also had a ten minute discussion about whether a particular Crémant d'Alsace would be more citrus or orchard fruit forward (Pinot Blanc blends are straight tricky) and it didn't feel forced, or pretentious, or even as absurd as it probably was from any objective perspective.

So, expand your horizons here. Better yet, it's the holidays: expand the horizons of others. Have a friend who, mystifyingly, still finds it funny to scream ""I am NOT drinking any fucking Merlot!"" yet you feel obligated to remain friends with? Get them some Château Pétrus and let them put that in their pipe and smoke it.

Bonus points: Their website is fantastic. The search options are sufficiently nerdy, and the landing page is surprisingly helpful, highlighting recent acquisitions, special sales, and generally interesting news in the world of wine. You don't have to be a cork-dork to like Crush, but don't be too surprised if you start to become one.",0.0
"These crepe cakes always make an amazing gift. My favorite has to be the green tea (matcha) flavor. It's very well balanced, not overpowering and not too sweet. I do find some of the other flavors too ""buttery."" PRO TIP: Don't eat too much of it because you will get sick of it. And yes, it's expensive. It is a luxury cake. Again, makes a GREAT gift.",0.0
"When you're sick of Starbucks, which most people who live in Midtown already are, definitely make a trip here.  It's THE best coffee in this part of Manhattan - highly recommend an iced latte or a flat white to drink.  

To eat, if you're craving something savory, then get either The Smash or The Pick Me Up.  If you're craving something sweet, definitely try The Sweet Uncle Fred.  Nom nom!",0.0
"This place was a big let-down.  I studied abroad in Puebla, Mexico, and one of the things I miss most, and nearly impossible to find at Mexican restaurants here in Horchata, a traditional Mexican drink.  I saw that they had it, and so I made the mistake of eating at this place.  I asked the guy behind the counter if the Horchata was made fresh (i.e. from scratch) and he said it was, in the kitchen.  But after tasting it, I strongly believe it was made from a mix, and not a good one at that.  Very disappointing.  But I could almost let that one go because of a possible miss-communication or language barrier.
The food wasn't terrible, and I was starving, so it did the trick, but definitely didn't feel like the best quality.  It looked like slop, and tasted like what you'd expect in a Mexican middle school cafeteria. I wasn't impressed, and though it didn't make me sick or anything, I think there are other better cheap-eats in that area (though Wogies isn't one of them).",0.0
"I wasn't aware of how popular Doughnut Plant was even though there was a constant snake-for-a-line the entire time I was there. I'll be back.......!!!

The only tasty treat I tried was one of their cake donuts. The Carrot Cake. I know, that was extremely foolish of me. It only took one ""doughnut"" to get me hooked though. The Carrot Cake doughnut was more than just moist and scrumptious. I would also say that the cake doughnut was more dense and filling than a normal donut. The icing on the outside made the Carrot Cake doughnut sweet, but it was the perfect amount to where it didn't make your teeth ache from a sugar attack. The size of the doughnut itself was a little small. It's deliciousness made up for its size however. After all, too much of anything will make you sick of it. 

I can't wait to go back and splurge on all the other doughnuts and drinks they have to offer!",0.0
"There's a good number of bars to choose from in fidi, many of them aren't really worth the time. So it's always good to find a cool place, with a good alcohol selection (especially the rum) and decent food. 

Open Door is basic bar in a lot of ways, but has just enough class to make it a cool after work spot. They've got a pretty sick whiskey shelf and they carried my Ron Zacapa rum, which is always a plus given that most bars are STILL only carrying Captain Morgan and Bacardi like this is 1985... They also have pretty good happy hour prices, making it a great after work option.

My group grabbed a table in the back and drank for the duration of happy hour and into the evening. I eventually grabbed an order of the pulled pork sliders with sweet potato fries. The sliders were ok... They definitely hit the spot, but didn't do much in the way of flavor in my opinion. There was also way too much pork on the slider, creating more of a mess than anything. Sweet potato fries were crack, as always. 

This a pretty cool place for happy hour and small bites I'd say. Nice bar, good drink selection and good prices.",0.0
"Slightly disappointed. 

Yeah, that pretty much sums up my experience at 11 Madison Park. After planning this evening for sometime, I can't help but expect nothing but the best. Don't get me wrong, 11 Madison wins many, many points but on this particular night, something was off. 

Upon arrive, they greeted us and even said Happy Bday to the lady of the evening. After we were seated, I got up to switch sides with the Mrs.  The servers quickly came over to extend the table for me. Very on point. 

Our Maitre D' welcome us explained our courses for the evening, let us choose our preferred flavors of the evening and gave us a start off black and white cookie. Starting to look promising. 

We were served by over 10 different people during our evening. Our glass of water were not even permitted to go down by half throughout the night. Each dish was of course explained and the servers were very down to Earth. Service was world class in every which way. 

Now the food. This is where the review goes down hill just a tad. 

Bread was croissant like. Flaky and buttery... Butter with hints of duck. 

Warm salad - pickled vegetable noodles with a pistachio or two with butternut squash. Served with duck broth. Nice and hearty. Good way to begin. Wow me? No. 

Seared Foie gras with blood sausage. Tasty, creamy but I think the star of the dish may have been the blood sausage. Better than foie gras at Jean George's? No. 

Rye bread with little mini dots of mustard and mayo served with perfectly cooked Pastrami. Lasting impression? Not really. 

Long Island plates. Oyster wrapped in a vinegar gelatin. Chopped scallops. Crab with pickled Daikon. Sturgeon caviar with quail egg. This was prepared nicely and the caviar with quail egg was clearly the impressionist. 

Stripped sea bass with shellfish squid ink sauce. Tiny little fish and had very little appeal with me. 

Sea urchin with foam on a bed of mashed potatoes. This was actually very, very good. 

So 11 Madison loves to show you the plates and how they are cooked. They come by and show me the celery root that was trapped inside a pig bladder and tell me they'll go into the kitchen to serve it. They lie. It's just a show piece. The same show piece I saw at least 15 times that night at different tables. I actually felt bad for the servers that had to repeat the same thing over and over. You can see it in their face. ""Stupid pig ball sack again and again"". 

As for the celery root with truffle gravy. Eh. It was ok. 

Blend of liver patte and cured duck meat. Nice touch. 

Next is the duck. Another show piece they walk around tables throughout the night. It was a bit tough and hard to cut but the taste was there. 

Cheese. We had 8 types of cheese to choose from. The variety was nice but there was one potent one that smelled and tasted like concentrated fart. Once I cut into it, the aroma seared our nostril hairs. It was pretty raunchy. Other than that, pretty clean and nutty flavors. 

Baked Alaska. Only real strong complaint of the night. Yet another showpiece I was sick of seeing. Fire was cool. The taste of this thing was... Out right awful. Patrons want dessert. Real dessert. Creme brûlée with a spin. Chocolate something to blow me away. A mousse perhaps, some kind of crazy lava cake. The taste of this was gross. The rum soaked bottom was too strong it become bitter. The Apple flavors just didn't work for me. However, they did say they'll be happy to give us something to substitute. 

I will say they do whatever it takes to make you happy. If you didn't like something, they would find ways to make it up to you. Service is perfect. Gift bag was nice. Granola was really good. Fancy good. 

As for the food, it missed on a lot of marks so the experience was not as remarkable as I thought it'd be. Not for the price that was paid.",0.0
"Good place to grab quick lunch. There's seating upstairs after you look around at the variety of options they have, but most people take it to go. There's something for everyone. If you're into healthy smoothies or juices, they have a lot of options to make your own too. I grabbed a package of sushi to go, and it tasted fine, and I didn't get sick. I believe there is free wifi as well.",0.0
"I myself was pretty surprised that I wanted to get some Asian food while I was in New York. Maybe it's because I was getting sick of eating non-Asian food, maybe it's because I wanted to actually give New York's Asian options a chance. Either way, no matter what part of this world you are in, there are very few things better on a cold night than good ol hot pot! Wish it didn't take 90 minutes to sit down, but I guess it speaks to the popularity of this place.

For $18.99 AYCE, it's more than worth the money. I only have one AYCE hot pot place to compare this place to (located in Fremont, CA). Gotta say that this place is just as good, if not better! Although the menu is a bit limited in terms of overall options, the quality of the meat. fish, and vegetables are great. I definitely do not go soft when it comes to hot pot soup base...the super spicy soup is absolutely delicious. And I love how they have an entire section solely for sauces, because I don't even get that at the place I usually go to.

Best part about this place is that the customer service is absolutely excellent. I'm used to Asian restaurants having crappy to average-at-best service. I was honestly super amazed at how nice and courteous everyone here was. Hell, I don't even get service this good at American restaurants! They even have plastic bags for jackets and bags so that you don't leave the place smelling like hot pot and/or BBQ after you're done.

Since this was a last-minute call, it was too late to make a reservation. Definitely make a reservation if you can, because the wait is really that long and this place really is THAT popular. Dunno if I want to come back because I do want to try other options in New York. But if I ever have that craving again, I know where I'm coming!",0.0
"This place is TINY! There is a small counter and I think there are only two small tables and that's it. The shop is cute, it kinda has a cute, country inn feel but no make no mistake, you get your goods to go. Once you get into the shop, the first thing you see is the counter with baked goods displayed behind a glass partition. The way the line is setup is kinda weird, the closest counter to you on the left is actually where you pay, the further counter on the right is where you order. And yes, I didn't get a cupcake because I am sick of them lol

The food:

Brooklyn Blackout Cake- Chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, fudge frosting. I thought the cake was nice, it was obviously very chocolatey but as much as I liked the cake, it really had a Betty Crocker feel to it. It was kinda like an upscale Betty Crocker, if you will. The cake was moist, the inside had a nice consistency and the frosting was a tad sweet but not too bad. I still enjoyed the good and would get it again.

Pecan Pie- They really should have called it, ""Pecan on Pecan on Pecan Pie."" This sucker was oozing pecans! I have never seen so many pecans on a pecan pie before, it was a good pie but oddly, I think it might have had too many pecans. * Gasp* I know... 

Strawberry Rhubarb- I thought this was just OK, I did like the nice flaky, buttery crust, but the filling was just so so for me, I thought the filling was rather too sweet and too intense.",0.0
"What does one do after a too many sickly sweet cakes and desserts? Why, have more sickly sweet drinks to back it up! It's tea-time! It's Chatime! And I think my diabetic specialist will cry after reading this but.. ONWARDS!

At Chatime, I ordered the milk tea with pearls (or boba), 100% sweet(ened with honey) and I got a regular cup!

Tea: 3/5 - Good flavour, nice strong tea taste and the honey was good! I can't remember seeing on their menu if they did a roasted milk tea like in Sydney but that my friends, we can figure out on the next visit.

Bubbles / boba: 3/5 - Yeah no. These guys were ok but they were inconsistent. Some were soft and chewy, others hard and not so pleasant.

Sweetness (100%): 5/5 - Sealed cup means I can shake it up and get the flavours all right. And right it was. Perfect sugar rush for sitting in Central Park, buzzing slightly and watching the world go by.

Ice: 3/5 - I would probably ask for less next time because towards the end, all I was left with was hard balls from too much ice.

Value: 3/5 - it was fine, not outrageous and not terrible.

This review is short, sweet and average. Much like their tea. Hrm.",0.0
"A lot of these places feel like they need to renovate or ""modernize."" Nunzio's, for instance. Slathered in stucco now, and painted a sickly tinned salmon color.

Not Lee's. And thank God for it. Draft Bud for $2.75 and large bar pizzas for $11. Tile floors, wood paneled walls and ceilings. Etched mirrors. A trophy shelf and an oil portrait of Lee. Or maybe Dickie, the second owner. Jets fans. But miraculous for a quasi sports bar in its unobtrusiveness. Everyone's got a rooting interest, but no one has to yell about it.

Fine calamari with good homemade sauce. Runs spicier than you'd expect. Might need salt. Lots of tentacles. Another small miracle.

The pizza is great. We're also rating for the unimpeachable atmosphere. But the pizza is at least four stars. Cracker crust, but just a bit pliant, and with some actual taste, too. Good, sweet sauce. And the pepperoni are those thick-cut coins that roll up into little bowls when they're cooked. Also flavorful. You always want that kind, but you usually get the sad Papa John's kind. This is it.

(Don't get the fresh mozzarella. Because a, you're cheap and it costs more, and b, this really isn't the kind of pizza for fresh mozz. This is cooked longer and slower, and in that time, the fresh stuff dries out.)

Thank God for Lee's in Dongan Hills.",0.0
"I've been here too many times to list. i love this place, no complaints. Service is excellent, I've had the grilled lemon pound cake every time and love it. The pound cake is not sicky sweet and not necessary with the figs that accompany it. The pork chop i had twice and first time was good, juicy but lacking a bit of flavor. I had it last night and it was kind of dry so maybe hit or miss with the pork chop but everything else I've had is great. I love that this place is in BK so that i can stop by for good food whenever i want. i've brought so many friends here & they've turned into repeat customers lol",0.0
"There doesn't seem to be too many amazing bakeries on this side of town and I was tasked with getting a cake from here for one of our employees who was leaving.  This is definitely a small bakeshop, a small seating area inside and a limited number of items available for sale,  We picked a simple chocolate cake and it was pretty good.  Nice and moist, made with quality chocolate and the best part was the fact that it wasn't sickly sweet.

"I realize it is an cultural and age thing, but I just don't get Bubble Tea and the other Tapioca Bead drinks that seem to be every 20 feet along Main Street in Flushing.  The line is long with what seem to be primarily high school age kids, but there are certainly some older folks waiting their turn or sucking hard on the large bore straws that allow the ""bubbles"" to be drawn into the mouth (Isn't that a choking hazard?).  

My friends wanted to try them, so who was I to demur?  I found myself drinking an overly sweet ""Green Tea"" concoction, with Purple Tapiocas and Red Beans occupying the bottom third of the thin plastic container. I wondered what was in the bubbles, as they had a rather sickly spongy/gooey consistency followed by a weird chew and swallow.  Some lab work should be done, as I doubt its ingredients have ever been evaluated. 

So, we took our drinks around the corner to a good Taiwanese bakery, ordered a few small cakes, and sat at their window bar to enjoy the street life.

"When Eataly first opened several years ago, everyone in NYC wanted to go.  Around that time, I did some Italian grocery shopping there while waiting for dinner, as well as enjoyed a good enough meal at the Manzo restaurant with visiting friends.  Eataly was very busy at the time, but it was still civilized, and one could still move around.

Fast forward to today, where during my past two visits, Eataly has been so packed that it is impossible to walk.  Yes, they do have a good selection of Italian food items, both prepared and available on grocery shelves.  However, you won't be able to see what is there because there are too many clueless people wandering aimlessly and standing in front of things.  Perhaps I just have bad timing.  In any case, you can find most, if not all, of these products elsewhere in the city.

Despite that, Eataly remained a good spot to stop in for gelato in summer, as it happens to be right next to Madison Square Park.  One can access the gelato stand without getting trapped in the tourist-engorged bowels of the place, although the wait for gelato is often an annoying 10-20 minutes.

On my last visit, the once delicious sweet-tart citrus gelato had been enhanced with a lot of sugar, I can only assume to please the American palate.  It was so disappointing and sickeningly sweet, that I couldn't finish it.  Now I will find another spot even for gelato. That was the death knell for my relationship with Eataly.  Don't say you were not warned...",0.0
"Pretty great sushi!  We ordered the gyoza first to start off  and they were great. For sushi we ordered the Philadelphia roll, sweet heart roll, spider roll and our personal favourite the Mayflower roll. We also ordered a strawberry and pineapple bubble tea. The Philadelphia roll was pretty standard and nothing special but still tasty, the sweetheart was pretty good as well. Our two favourites were the spider roll and the Mayflower.  They were delicious!! And if we weren't stuffed we'd have ordered more.  

There was a slight mix up with my drink order though when i ordered a pineapple bubble tea ans got some weird brown drink that tasted sickly sweet and bitter at the same time.

"I am a coffee drinker, but am still partial to Teavana. It's a great neighborhood place to relax and do work. It's much less crowded than a Starbuck's would be. If you're coming to do work, they have lots of outlets, and fast internet. 

I come for the environment, but also have enjoyed their tea and food options. For tea, I keep it simple with unsweetened iced green tea. It's quite good. And all of their drinks are only 99 cents for a refill until you leave. Amazing!

I've also tried their frittata with ham, cheese, and veggies. It was flaky, warm, and held me over until dinner. The only minor negative is that it smells sickeningly sweet upon arrival. It's likely their drink sweetener. Beyond that though, this is a great place to go.",0.0

And the drinks average about $4, unspeakable for a Chinatown bakery: I SERIOUSLY doubt your bubble tea tops Cocos.  I tried the green tea / red bean custard bun and the hot dog scallion bread.

"I like the name because it matches the farmhouse decor, though my friends found it misleading and confusing, they think it insinuates merely breakfast food. The restaurant was about half full. It's on an awesome block in williamsburg with shopping, a barbershop and an art gallery! The vibe was relaxed and peaceful. Decor was farmhouse chic and clean. 5 friends and I went here on MLK day and the wait time for a table was 15 min. We ended up getting a table under a skylight, yaaaasss! Huge skylight in the back room, love it. Automatically see the molasses milkshake and decide I would order that and the duck sandwich. Both I recommend! Though, I wish the bread was fresher. My one friend said that the fried chicken sandwich had a bun too small for the size of the chicken and it was extremely greasy! To the point where he felt sick. Hopefully it's not always like that. Fun times drawing and playing hangman on the placemats, they have crayons at every table! The kitchen seriously needs to step up its game though, it took 15 min before we saw our first server, 30 min after that for the milkshake by someone different, 30 min after that to receive the sandwich, and 45 min after that to see our first server again to ask for the check. The servers definitely needs to keep a better eye on their table, if they want to be busier. They were all very sweet though. Maybe they should try a seating chart with sections, I didn't see one. It would probably make the hostess positions easier too.

"After 2 failed trips to Donut Plant cause both stores ran out of donuts... we ended up at Holey Cream. Always wanted to try cause the pictures I've seen look sooo interesting but the concept of Holey Cream is a lot better than actually eating the donut sandwich that it produces.

Concept of the donut sandwich is simple. Pick your icing (chocolate or vanilla), the ice cream flavor you want in the middle and the toppings you want on top of the donut. Ends up being around $8 for the donut i think! 

They have a wide range of ice cream flavors from sea salt caramel to Dulce de Leche. I got the Dulce de Leche and it was reallyyyyy goood! The donut itself is why this place gets 3 stars. The donut isnt that special. It is honestly a plane donut that gets glorified by the ice cream. I honestly rather just go to an ice cream shop and get the Dulce de Leche on a cone. 

Overall, the experience was interesting and exciting for about 2 minutes when youre deciding what to put on the donut but dies down after you take a few bites. The donut ends up being HUGEE so make sure to sure because you'll get sick of it after a while cause its so sweet.",0.0

"I have been to MARU at least twice a year for the past three years I have been in New York City and a lot has changed about it.

First things first, the elevator to get to MARU will forever be the slowest elevator you have ever waited for. It's small too so not that many people can fit in so you really have to wait, especially on a busy weekend night. You can't take the stairs up because the doors are locked but you can take the stairs down if someone isn't vomiting in the stairwell.

MARU used to be a place for college students to come and party but the crowd has definitely changed to older party goers (late 20s+) and with that, the dress code is more casual. The drinks are expensive aka NYC standard and the music is okay. Like most places in K-Town, it can get pretty ratchet here (shocker) and it was really hard to converse with other people since the music was really loud. The decor is pretty cool compared to most of the lounges in K-Town. The service is good too as it didn't take too long to order a drink or to get my drink. 

I haven't gone here to karaoke, only here for drinking, so I can't really say much about the karaoke part. I've also never ordered food here since Food Court and BCD are next door and Woorijip is across the street .

It's not my favorite place to party but if someone is having a party, I'll come. If you're a girl, get a guy to buy you drinks because you definitely won't want to pay for the bill.",0.0

I cannot wait until they go out of business--hopefully sooner, than later.",0.0
"Went here to have ice cream. The woman who was attending was very moody and not patient with our order. Later some tourist came in and ordered vanilla ice cream, the ice cream was not frozen, it was liquid! She did not explain to them or give then another option, they stood there waiting! To make matters worst, as I sat there eating I saw something green on one of the profiteroles on display. When I got closer I realized it was mold! I told the clerk and they just said ""oh ok I'll take it out thank you"". Very disappointed! I came here expecting quality service and dessert, didn't get either! Will definitely not come again, afraid of getting sick from mold on food.",0.0
"This is a part one of my soon to be two parted review.

I came here for dessert only after having a sick dinner at another close-by location. I heard great things about the vanilla merengue cake, saw countless pictures putting this cake on some sort of weird pedestal like it was orgasmic if you were blessed enough to have it pass through your lips. So, being in the area and wanting some gucci dessert, I hit up this joint. My date and I walked inside, had the door opened for us by some doorman, and then we waited not yet inside the restaurant but in the doorway near the computer and what seemed to be some sort of hostess stand. Noone came to open the door or speak to us, and the doorman was chillin and didn't know what was good either. So, we entered and stood at the front of the restaurant by the four-seated bar for about six whole minutes. Finally, some suited italian man hastily walked over and leaned into me and raised his eyebrows. He didn't say anything and then I didn't say anything so then as I was about to speak up, he huffed ""What can I do for you tonight?"" while he looked around the restaurant in some sort of nervous hurry. I proceeded with ""We would like to sit down for some dessert."" He then made some sort of face and said ""only at the bar,"" then walked away. We were left with one empty chair at the bar, an awkward first date couple with some man trying to impress a younger attractive woman, and a couple of other dwellers. We sat at the bar for ten whole minutes with four bartenders and none approached us or even made eye contact. Finally, as one of them was washing his hands at the sink, I raised my voice and asked for the dessert menu. He then said that there was no menu and that he would have someone show us the desserts in the center of the restaurant. I was in no mood to wait 25 minutes to walk in the middle of some fancy restaurant and gaze at the desserts like some weird 5 year old in a candy store, so five minutes later when I got his attention again, I asked for two of the merengue cakes to go. Two minutes later, the suited up italian ""host"" approached me and said ""we have a table for you two if you want to sit down now."" I agreed, and we walked over to our table. The entrees and food and everything around us looked so good that I wished I hadn't eaten before we came. Anyway, our waiter was very nice and we got our cakes and ate. The cake was so lame. The merengue was pretty gucci but really the inside was tasteless and it was so filling. I really do not know why everyone made such a big deal about the cake. The host then checked on us with a friendly attitude now, and a completely different vibe like we actually mattered now. We were done and we asked for the check twice before we got it. The service was very slow and they definitely need to get on that for an establishment of such a caliber that it's supposed to be. Next time, I will make a reservation for dinner and give this j one more chance. But, for now, it's sus and the cake is whack. The dinner crowd was also an older crowd, so we seemed out of place.",0.0
"I ordered my usual Trenta toffee nut iced coffee w/ Washington Apple pound cake. There was about 6 people waiting for they drinks and only 1 barista, she was clearly overwhelmed. The venti iced coffee she was making overfilled and spilled all over so she then reached over and gave the lady my trenta cup I saw Judy make. ""excuse I think that's mine, it has my name on it"" (by this time the lady is at the bar adding sweetener to the drink she was given), she then asked the lady if she order a trenta size and she said no brought it back over to the barista who then slides it in front of me and says here........
""Is it possible to get a new drink please she opened it and was speaking over the drink"" she gave me this nasty look and started slamming and banging thing around while she made the lady and my drink over.

"Came here for Brunch with a few friends last Saturday and our overall experience was ""ok"" to ""not great"". We arrived at 2 and were not even acknowledged until 2:25p when we had to aggressively flag down the waiter(who was also the host up front). Sure we were waiting for our 5th guest but they could have come said hello and gotten initial drink orders(we were also the first table near the door and the host/waiter so we weren't that far away) I'm not sure if they had a sick call out but it didn't work well. Everything was a wait, drink orders, food, refills, getting the check, etc....Food was very good, and that's the only reason I would have given this place another shot....what will not make me come back is the very snarky, sarcastic, and rude response that Eddy Fontana gave a Yelp reviewer(Alexandra F) 3 months ago. Yes we live in a world where ppl subjectively form their opinions about others on these sites, but as a manager I presume, Eddy should have taken the high road in his response. Clearly he admitted to ""being a new place and having hiccups"" this type of leadership is completely unacceptable and it showed in our service on Saturday...., and Yes I am in the service industry as a Director leading employees to do what's best for customers. What kind of example is this?? And what kind of tone does it set for your clients? I don't expect to have me or any of my friends step foot in the door....you have way too much competition in the neighborhood for that foolishness!",0.0
"I came here with my sister because we wanted to try authentic Kobe beef. We also had a groupon for 2 ($30 for $60). We made a reservation and were seated immediately, but there was a lot of open seating so we probably didn't need to make a reservation.

What we ordered: 
Arugula salad: tasted fine, seemed a bit empty, just had a few cherry tomatoes and candied walnut CRUMBS, I wouldn't have known they were walnuts if it didn't say do on the menu...all this for $12 :/
Kobe ribeye 3 oz: medium rare, delicious but mostly just fat... I don't know if they just cut 3 oz of a corner or something but there was very little meat
Kobe strip loin 6 oz: medium rare, absolutely delicious, had more meat and I liked this better than the ribeye simply because it felt like I had a steak not a plate of fat 

Of note: the service was terrible, when we ate our salad, the waiter kept asking if we were done even though there was still salad in the plate, I really felt rushed to eat; also my sister was sick and asked for hot water, the first cup of hot water had brown specks inside it, and after she drank a cup (a clean cup) she asked for a refill and they just never gave her one. We also asked for more bread and they never came with bread either. I don't know if they were being cheap or what, but honestly hot water and bread is not that expensive. When I asked for the check, the waitress came back with the bill really quickly...

All in all, I'm glad I tried Kobe beef and I would love to eat Kobe beef again, but just not at this restaurant.",0.0

"Today I stopped by to grab a beer and finish up some work. I had the ""pleasure"" of being served by Jordan. The most flippant bartender I have ever come across. I was about to order food and another beverage when I mentioned that I did not receive my cookie from my order on the previous night. ( mind you I go here all of the time as I live less than a block away). He paused.  Rolled his eyes. The said ""fine. Whatever "" I asked if there was a problem and he said ""I wasn't here last night so I don't know"". Basically questioning if I was lying about a $3 cookie. It was embarrassing and offensive. In addition, I ordered one of the new cocktails ""the Frida"". He said we have margaritas for $5. I asked if I could get a different type of tequila. Then he smugly replied"" then it wouldn't be a happy hour margarita then would it?""  Mind you, this is all because they weren't able to serve draft beer. I don't drink well tequila as it makes me very sick. So.,, yeah... There was that too. He is the king of condescending. And I left with such a bad taste in my mouth, I'm not sure when I'll be back. And it will certainly NEVER be when Jordan is bartending. Thanks for ruining my Friday happy hour! Now I have to go home to screaming little kids and deal with that.

"Worst experience ever...ordered food for delivery for over 2 hours as I was sick.. Called them about an hour and fifteen minutes past my order and was told that my order is on its way.  Waited another half hour and continued calling them with no answer.  I finally decided to go to the restaurant and was greeted by a very rude waiter.  The hostess was too busy answering calls and after continuing to ask them what happened to my order and was it out for delivery, I was told that that order didn't make it to them as they had internet problems.  I asked for the manager but was rudely told by the waiter that they were not around and if I have any problem to cancel my order.  I have never had such a bad experience at any restaurant ever... I would never recommend this place to anyone simply due to the pathetic service and rude employees",0.0

Very neat and very orderly. Great selection of flowers. Really good fresh vegetables. Frozen food & Ice Cream. Good deli - great tuna fish salad, (been told). Massive candy selection. 

The owners are really very nice to everyone. Maybe too nice, dog owners bring their giant beasts in too often. A few weeks ago an over-confident narcissistic twenty something (that we have too many of in this neighborhood and on earth) and it's girlfriend brought in a massive animal, like it must have weighted 100 pounds.

"Just an absolutely superb dining experience. I felt giggly and giddy. A lot of fun. I ate so much that I had to walk 30 blocks after dinner. I was full, way too full, uncomfortably full. Yes it is super expensive and there is a dress code but it isn't snotty or intimidating. I felt very free to be myself and I even asked one of our many servers if I could steal a pen. I like to steal pens.....it is a thing....she said no, but she thought it was funny. I have about 60 pens from everywhere! Ok I am sick. 

THE FOOD! Oh come on....it was superb! Every morsel! I hate to sound cliche but the oysters and pearls were just out of this world. And they served them with a mother of pearl spoon. I am opposed to foie gras for obvious reasons and vowed to never eat it, but.....I did. And it blew my mind. I loved it. But I wont eat it again. Guilt and shame. Delicious shame. The lobster dish was served with sauce bordelaise SO PERFECT! Honestly, why on earth is Lobster usually served with butter instead? It really shouldnt be. Bordelaise is much much better.  The dark chocolate with mint, REAL MINT....not that fluffy white crap, and the rose macaron will make you cry. I also was served a glass of Gewürztraminer grape juice because I dont drink alcohol and it was a spiritual experience. I had no idea anyone made grape juice with Gewurz. I came home and ordered half of a case online. WOW!

"Was craving hotpot on a cold Wednesday night, so we decided to head to 18Hipot.  I rarely ever do hotpot outside of my own home because I love the variety I can buy at supermarkets to customize what I like most.  This restaurant sticks out because of how chic it looks with its obsidian-like décor and dimly lit atmosphere.  It almost reminds me of a fusion place, but this is very much what traditional hot pot is all about.  

Upon entering, we were seating immediately.  The way that this works is that you order a broth from the menu and you pick platters that you would like to go with it.  They have a wide range from beef intestines (highly recommend, Chinese favorite) to pork blood.  The seafood platter I feel is a must because they have a wide variety of shrimp, clam, even lobster.  Then, they put the large pot in front of you and turn on the stove and you can cook your food.  Also - it might seem like boiled food has no flavor, but go towards the bathrooms and be sure to make use of their sauce station!  This part is what made me love it the most - the variety of Asian sauces (BBQ, Soy, Siracha...oh my!) and garlic, parsley, scallions, etc. 

Now note - the service is very friendly and the wait for food is not long, after all you do boil it yourself, they just prepare it and make it look outstanding with their little flower decorations and neat arrangements.  Now, is the food fresh?  I would say that it is pretty fresh, we had seafood, a basket of greens, and a platter of beef.  All of it was fresh, no wilted leaves or bad seafood (or else I would have been sick already!  Haha).   Also, the broth is delicious in that it's not just a pot of water with a package of MSG mixed into it.  They put pork skin, tomatoes, mushrooms and even give you a complimentary basket with greens, mushrooms, a raw egg, etc. to go with it.  

Also note - free icecream at the end!  The green tea and red bean are good :)  Plus, totally forgot to mention, 10% off on weekends and holidays and 20% off on weekdays!

I absolutely love this place, I would just say it is a bit pricey and not suitable for people who do not eat meat as it is a Chinese-themed restaurant without many vegetarian options.  However, it is awesome for large groups as each pot only costs about ~$10 and sharing food is no problem, plus you can experience different broths and the restaurant has enough space to seat many.",0.0
"I had horrible experience in trying to attend my good friend's birthday party here.  They claimed at the door that dress code is at the ""doorman's discretion"" which really translates to dress code is at the doorman's prejudice.  The lady, Masha, at the door claimed that we could not come in because we were wearing flat sandals and that it was a safety liability to wear such footwear so we couldn't come in.  She claimed that if we had arrived by 10 p.m. we could have entered with flat sandals but for some reason platforms, stilettos, and heels with the toes out were perfectly permissible after that time.  So in other words we could have rocked our flat sandals alongside the girls with the heals if we had showed up before 10 p.m.?  I still don't get how that makes sense...

When we began to question Masha at the door, she obnoxiously turned away from us and sicked the security guards on us.  We were not being overly demanding, loud, or ""ratchet"", we were simply asking her questions..  When the security guard came he cleared not only the group of four that I was with, but the whole line because he assumed we were all together because we were black.  

When we demanded to speak to the manager he did come down to speak to us.  He claimed that his staff said that we charged/bum-rushed the security line.  Excuse me?!  His security guards were like 7 feet tall and 400 pounds each and there were like four of them; we would be insane to do such a thing.  

What upset us most is that we thoroughly investigated the venue before we arrived and made reservations.  It does not state anywhere on their website that there is a dress code other than that it is ""casual.""  We were on the guest list for about two weeks prior to us showing up.  We were expecting a group of at least 20 people, so obviously it's the business' loss.  Once a majority of our party arrived we gathered in front and departed together.  However, even while waiting for our party the security guards still harassed us about standing on the sidewalk.  Again, excuse me?!  We have the right to be there any time of day or night.  Period.  It is, afterall, a public sidewalk.

I would not recommend this venue to anyone.  Their door service sucks, which could only be a precursor to what it's really like inside.",0.0
"Honestly, the best chicken sandwich I've ever had.  You get a big slab of chicken that's perfectly cooked and has the right amount of seasoning (compared to Chick-fil-A, which borders on being over-spiced).  It's the kind of sandwich you could eat every day without getting sick of it.  

They make an awesome whiskey ginger, too--whiskey forward, light sweetness, very refreshing. 

You can tell that the fries have some effort put into them, but they're not quite as crispy as I would have wanted.  But the inside is nice and fluffy.

"Great food, great service! We are from out of town but will definitely go here again the next time we come to NYC. The food wasn't as heavy/greasy as most Italian food that I've had. I didn't walk away feeling guilty for what I just ate, if that makes sense. And I had the minestrone soup (lots of yummy vegetables in a broth type soup), farfalle Alfredo (normally that would be enough make you carb drunk right?? But this wasn't so heavy for some reason), and banana foster for dessert. It was perfect portions, and just the right amount of decadence without being so much that would make me feel sick after. My significant other had a mozzarella appetizer (so yummy!), venison pasta, and tiramisu. Normally I wouldn't have ever tried venison in any form, but I had a taste and it was actually delicious! The place was a little more upscale than I expected, with plates in the $20-25 range. We stopped in for lunch partly just to get out of the rain, but everyone there was so nice and accommodating that I completely forgot that I was in workout sweats instead of something nicer.

But the ribs were cooked to perfection the meat fell right off the bone and was complemented perfectly with the sauce. The pulled pork was great and the mac and cheese had a great kind of savory sour note to it.

"So my fiance and I go to Delmonico's Kitchen for his birthday dinner with a reservation. There's a raucous holiday party going on in their main dining room, so we're seated by the front door in the bar area. They were showing sports on the TV, and people were cheering and groaning. Plus, we kept getting blasted with cold air when the front door opened. We asked to be moved and were told there wasn't a single table left in the house.  Ok, fine, not the romantic dinner we were hoping for, but we were hungry. 

A woman comes out of the holiday party and vomits spectacularly right by the host stand and our table. She walks through her own sick out the front door. She shouldn't have been overserved, but it's not the restaurant's fault she puked. I don't blame them for that. But the staff stood around looking at the vomit for 10 minutes. They stationed a waiter there, presumably to help people avoid walking through it since it was near the front door, but he really just ended up pointing out to people when they'd already stepped in it. I truly don't understand how hard it is to grab a mop out of the kitchen and take care of it. The staff was just looking at it with horrified expressions on their faces. 

I was becoming nauseous myself with the smell and was about to retreat to the restroom when the vomiter returned. She was absolutely wasted, with puke all over her legs and feet, holding a tissue to her mouth, looking like she wasn't done getting it all out. On her way to the restroom, she continued vomiting. I didn't end up following her to the restroom. 

At this exact moment, our food arrived. The runner seemed surprised that we didn't want to eat next to a pile of vomit showing no signs of being cleaned up anytime soon. My fiance had to demand that we be moved, which they accommodated. We were re-seated in the dining room upstairs, which smelled fine. I get that it's confusing to transfer tables between sections and servers; I used to be a server myself. But this restaurant could not get it together the rest of the meal. There was massive confusion, with our new server trying to take our order again, us sitting there for ten minutes waiting for our food, several different servers taking over our table, bringing us the wrong check, etc. 

The food was decent, but not fantastic. It's hard to say if I would have enjoyed it more without the smell of vomit lingering in my nose. They had put our food under heat lamps or something, and by the time they brought our food to the new table, my fiance's medium-rare steak was well done. Portion sizes were pretty good. We ordered 3 sides but really only ate the equivalent of one side between the two of us. The restaurant brought us a complimentary baked Alaska dessert as an apology, which we appreciated. It wasn't very good, but I also don't like dessert. 

I don't think I'll be back, even though it's in my neighborhood. For a couple hundred bucks after tip, we could have had a much better meal at many other restaurants in the city, even if you factor out the puke and the amount of time it took to clean it up.

"Dear god. A sugar addict's paradise.

I've been here several times for the famous Salty Pimp (which is delicious), but this past weekend I tried a seasonal special, the Pumpkin Gobbler ($6.50 with tax). This mammoth sundae includes vanilla soft serve with pumpkin butter, maple syrup, pie pieces, and a mountain of whipped cream.

It's sickly sweet and kind of like eating your grandma's pumpkin pie on crack. I took two bites and decided there was no way I was ever going to finish it. And then I took another. And another.

And five minutes later I was scraping the sides with my spoon. Whoops. Time to break out the stretch pants.

"A friend and I stumbled upon this place while strolling around LES on a Thursday evening.  Most of the restaurants in the area fell into one of two categories: completely crowded with a line outside and an hour wait for a table, or next to completely empty.  Mancora was, thankfully, an exception.  Lively but not too crowded, we decided to get our Peruvian grub on.

Drinks here are very good.  I knew I had to try a Pisco drink... or two!  The Pisco Sour was delicious, light and refreshing.  The Pisco Pasion, however, was sickeningly sweet.  So in sum, one hit and one miss.  If you're not in the mood for Pisco, they also have other Latin-themed drinks like mojitos and caipirinhas, too.  But I say, when in Rome (or Peru, in this case)....

The food was solid all around.  Even the free bowl of plantain chips and green dip for the table was delicious!  Everything we ordered was very good; the octopus appetizer was cooked perfectly, the ceviche was decent, and the mixed grilled seafood with panca sauce was fantastic.  I wish I had a second stomach to try some Peruvian dessert, but alas, the delicious seafood took up all available real estate in my bellay.  Next time!

"Order a duck from these  rip off artist or con artist to say the least.  I decided to eat good tonight and ordered a whole duck.  I asked that I wanted all the pieces everything.

I was looking at the guy cutting the duck who was wearing a white hate apron and white pants [was not an angel in no regards] and he put some of my duck pieces  into his little tray on the side while he is cutting it.  After, I received my duck.

I noticed that the dishonest fool with the white hat,  cuts pieces or part of your duck and basically gives it too the next customer who orders half a chicken [which he left over in that tray].   What I also noticed is that if a person who can speak their language comes in and orders.  They will get the entire duck and the fool with the white hat will not try to rip them off and put their duck parts in that stupid tray of his.

I just find this place very dishonest and untrustworthy.  WAKE UP IT 2014 this non sense NO longer flies with people.

#4.  One spoon though I ordered 2 dishes.

Not sure what the little ol' lady's problem was but it left a sour taste in my mouth.  Outside of that the place is a solid 4.  Good for when you're sick or have digestive problems, but for the amount of money I'd eat somewhere else.",0.0
Love this place! Even the bread and black beans are amazing. The restaurant is nice and big and u don't feel cramped. The service is good and the atmosphere is great too. The portions are big and the groupon is a great deal. I would go again if I was on the Upper West Side. I had the surf and turf after being sick and the meal hit the spot!,0.0
"I just had one of the most upsetting lunches of my life at Greensquare Tavern, a place where I've gone for several business and personal lunches and dinners and drinks with friends and coworkers. Here's what happened. 

Came with a new coworker to talk business and get to know each other at about 11:45. The place was mostly empty and we were promptly greeted and seated. 

She ordered an Arnold Palmer that ended up being a lemonade seltzer only the first time, then was a splash of iced tea over it the second time. The third time, the waiter poured a lemonade mix or something at the table along with iced tea, which looked much more Arnold Palmer-like but still wasn't quite right, maybe because of the organic/fair trade-type drinks they have or maybe because of a language barrier. But I digress.

My colleague ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered a turkey burger with cheese. Normally the fact that the waiter mixed these two up between two customers wouldn't be a big deal aside from embarrassment that we bit into each others burger and had to awkwardly request and either wait for or take out a redo. HOWEVER, I haven't eaten beef in 16 years and took a bite of her cheeseburger, which could make me sick since ones body isn't used to eating beef after a period of time like this and can have a weird reaction to it.

We asked to speak with a manager who came over to the table basically yelling at us, already on the defensive. He said he had already ""yelled at the moron in the kitchen"" (which for the record I would never want as it was a human mistake -- not a good thing but just an error nonetheless). He didn't let me get a word in and said a haste ""Sorry"" not caring that I was emotionally very upset about what just happened and that was it. 

We eventually got replacement meals and had to pay the $53 with tip for the beef and turkey burger and two nonalcoholic drinks -- he didn't even comp the meal! (Oh, right, he offered lunch on him when I said I was surprised he didn't comp the meal when I walked out shaking because I was so upset.) Unbelievable. I won't be back again and I will definitely tell my other colleagues about this experience.",0.0
"Beautiful bar w/ beautiful mahogany accents. Service was attentive. I'll always know how good service is based upon how they manage my indecisions/sass. I had asked to try 2 different types of sparkling wine and 2 reds, ended up settling on a glass of Jouet. Practical stuff (Y).

Pot Pie had a fancy set up, but no depth despite the ingredients advertised on the menu. Dessert was much better. Cute appearance & easy to pick up--no-fuss dessert ideal to share on dates and such. That sickly sweet element in Oreo omitted, just the unique not-actually-chocolate flavor in Oreos made dominant along side the ice cream. I have heard great things about their burger though, so looking to come back for that.",0.0
"Live close by so was hoping for my new local. Menu sounded good. Ordered. Waitress brought my started and my main course at the same time (no big deal). But then I had the horrific sickening experience of biting into a RAW UNCOOKED burger! I asked for medium rare and bite into a blue burger (aka the meat was cold, raw, slimy and the cheese in the middle was not melted). The waitress took it back and it was returned to me oily, plasticy and unappetizing. I am a fat person and generally not picky but the meat was unseasoned, greasy -- tasted like it had been soaked in cold oil. Shudder!  I went in hoping for the best and the menu sounded so promising but it was a giant flop. Even if the burger had been cooked -- the bun was too big/thick for the burger and drowned it. The side salad was the best part of my meal -- I got the mixed green salad. It was the only reason I paid for my meal. p.s my starters were the wings and they were not spicy -- but not bad. Soaked in a slightly sweet red capsicum bell pepper puree. I had asked for no tomatoes & mayonnaise on my burger -- but waitress forgot...Never again!!!!!!!! Service was prompt & friendly. Pity she got my order requests wrong. Also-FYI its cash only (machine nearby)",0.0
"You know, for a borough whose official motto should be: ""This is why we can't have nice things!"", it's a surprise a place like this place even exists. Its reputation proceeds even its existence because arbitrary people in my life on many separate occasions have expressed their love for the place. How could a joint, so unassuming, in a desolate area of an even more desolate borough become such a sleeper hit? Well, it's simple.

The food's good
and the food's cheap.

It's a lot easier to think of this place more as a fish market as opposed to a restaurant. Because essentially that's what it is-- a fish market that decided to install 3 fryers. Cutting the middleman out, you can have your fish straight from the market, and it's a business model that's doing wonders. Being the mom & pop shop (I just realized that rhymed) that it is, its prices remain cheap; which is great because half of their menu actually consists of a type of steamed fish, complex carbs, & vegetables; a dinner setup you might recognize as a pretty damn good diet for bikini season. And if any of you are wondering, good fats contribute to the development of testosterone because that's basically what testosterone is made up of. A salmon a day, keeps the wife happy... and some tongue.

What really tops it off for me, are the condiments. They make their own tartar sauce, juice their own lemons, and all the old bay sauce you could ever want. I think America needs to take a heavy consideration into officially switching regular fries with... Old Bay Waffle Fries. Like, regular straight salty fries should be something you have to ask for when you're sick of Old Bay Waffle Fries (which you never will get sick of). They don't do waffle fries here... that's just wishful thinking. Something to think about Manuel! Something to think about.",0.0

"Just moved to the neighborhood from the Upper West Side, where I was an avid Cafe Frieda goer.  In need of my weekly Mexican fix, I hit up Maya.  

Was on the verge of ordering the Sur guacamole but luckily (thankyouverymuch), my server saved me from the awful yet hilarious scene that would have ensued once I had realized the key ingredient was none other than--grasshoppers.  I settled for the guac with bacon, cotija, and chicarron instead.  Yummy, but bit into a few rock-like chunks of chicarron that hurt my teeth.  

I ordered the slow roasted pork carnitas for my main course while my fiance got the beef short ribs.  Drooled at and devoured everything and proceeded to feel sickeningly full afterwards.  Would recommend but taking a star off for price/value.  

Don't get the michelada here - it's basically a beer with a shot of spice and spicy salt around the rim.  Perhaps I have a different perception of what a michelada is supposed to taste like... Salty, umami, spicy, lime-y goodness and this fell far short.  DO get the Maya with mezcal though.  Absolute favorite part of my meal and a hefty thanks to my server for introducing me to this sweet, smoky goodness drank mm mmm mmmmm.",0.0
"Adorable place to satisfy my salty or sweet, or breakfast or dinner cravings.

They have daily baked items, fabulous cakes, and a to-go section of salads or onigri.

I bought a small selection of cakes for a birthday and it went over great.  They were the chestnut cake, strawberry shortcake, and raspberry something cake.  I got them for my boyfriend's father's birthday and he loved them.  Pretty much gobbled one slice before the rest of us were able to start digging in.  I had some of the strawberry and raspberry cakes and both were tasty yet light and only slightly sweet (I'm not a big fan of sickenly sweet desserts).

Will be a must do for my next cake need",0.0

"Meh. The atmosphere is nice as others have said and there's usually some available seating, a huge plus for anywhere in NYC. The coffees I've ordered from them have been fine and prepared with reasonable promptness. I once ordered some kind of chickeny deli sandwich from them and it was kind of gross. They did heat it up on a grill, but it took over ten minutes which annoyed me, and then it had some kind of gross sickeningly sweet condiment on it. The sweet foods I've had from here are passable. My main gripe is that the staff is kind of cold, don't expect any smiles or enthusiasm.",0.0
"I dug it. Came here for a late Sunday dinner; seated quickly, polite greeting. I had the shrimp and pork vermicelli bowl . The pork was perfect, so well seasoned.  Tons of fresh vegetables. The man had the mixed seafood pho. He liked it but went a little overboard on the sirrachia and chili oil and had to fight through the pain (his own fault). 

Minor (very minor) gripe: I don't like being served beverages in plastic to-go cups at a seated restaurant. My Thai iced tea and his mango bubble tea both came with plastic cups with lids. His bubble tea was sickeningly sweet, like waaaay too sweet. We ended up throwing it away. I would go back, especially to try the Shabu. Just skip the bubble smoothies next time.",0.0
"This bakery is without doubt pretty amazing. The reason I give it three stars isn't really it's fault, it's just that no bakery in the world could live up to the hype it gets.

Don't waste your time waiting for it's star items like the Cronut and milk and cookie shot, just go for a normal pastry and enjoy it.",0.0
"I love the sophisticated-barn decor, the fact that it wasn't too loud, and the ample spacing between tables.  Our waiter was very nice and provided great service.  My fiance and I shared the burrata appetizer, pork sausage, burrata pizza, and lardo tortellini in broth.  All were delicious.

While the broth for the tortellini was a little too salty, I have no other complaints about our savory dishes.  The flavors were wonderful and everything was perfectly cooked.  If I had to choose a favorite, I would probably say it was the two appetizers (the sausage and the burrata).

For dessert, we ordered the parsnip honey cake and the fried ricotta dumplings with honey dipping sauce.  Portions were extremely generous however I found everything to be sickeningly sweet and could barely eat it.

On a separate note, I loved their wine list, that offered a variety of choices from different geographies.  I especially loved the Corsican white I ordered on the wine by the glass list, which was delicious and unique.

I'll be back, but I'll skip dessert next time.",0.0
"So light and fluffy!

When I think cheesecake, I think dense, sweet, creamy, and something I can only take a few bites of. Eileen's has completely dispelled my preconceptions of cheesecake. Not only was I able to take multiple bites, but I thought the flavors were spot on.

While I only tried the blueberry, for the price I would definitely come back and order a bunch for a birthday party. Who needs $3.50, $4 cupcakes that are so sickeningly sweet when you can order a dozen cheesecakes for the same price and choose from a much larger range of flavors?

"Georgetown cupcakes are quickly becoming my favorite cupcakes ever. I love cupcakes, and have tried them at Baked by Melissa, Sprinkles, Crumbs, Magnolia, and Amy's Bread. Outside of Amy's Bread Red Velvet (which is the best red velvet ever in my opinion), Georgetown cupcakes are the absolute best. Why? Because they aren't super sickly sweet. They are delicious without being overly dry or dense. They are tasty, and I love that they use the real food/ingredient when making a cupcake to give it that natural taste. For example, their strawberry cupcake has fresh chunks of strawberries in it to give it that great flavor and same with the cookies and cream.

Hands down the best cupcakes I've had in NYC!",0.0
"Waited for 20 mins when the entire lower level was empty. The waiter rushed us to order because there were so many people waiting. The food was the worst I've had at an Applebee's (normally 2-2.5 stars depending on location). I ordered the Thai shrimp salad, which came with some flavorless shrimp, and salad dumped from a bag (limp & brown lettuce, shredded carrots, cabbage) and fried wonton noodle strips. In addition to being not fresh, my salad was tiny & expensive. It should have been advertised as a $15 appetizer. My companion ordered buffalo wings, chicken quesadilla, and spinach artichoke dip with tortilla for $17. The 4 buffalo wings were in this sickeningly sweet barbecue sauce that made our teeth hurt & dry like a bone. The chicken quesadilla was so dry that the tortilla broke into sharp shards when we bit into it. It was filled with a few pathetic pieces of chicken and a bit of chewy cheese. The spinach artichoke dip was accompanied by tortilla chips that were soaked in grease and bent when we tried to bite a piece. The dip was probably the best dish, but I would give it 2 stars. The waiter checked up on us once, but seemed overwhelmed with the number of customers he has to attend to. We joked that we would have been better off eating a Jamaican patty on the street. Never again.",0.0
"Nice looking shop and really great staff. 

I found several of the teas to be sickly sweet. 
I thought the 'berry poppins' would be a nice herbal tea but it had a sweet bubblegum taste. It turns out the ingredients included ""artificial blackberry and cream flavouring"". I don't know or care what cream flavoring is but I threw the tea out. The 'sunny citrus' sounded great but I hated the taste, not sure why it needed ""artificial vanilla "" and I have no clue why it tasted so sweet. If I wanted candy I would've bought candy. I don't sweeten my tea.

I wanted to love their teas but was really disappointed. 

Quite expensive for all their artificial flavorings.",0.0
"Was attracted here by the wafting smells of the baked goods and the S'mores Cookie staring at me through the window. It was love at first sight. As I walked in, a stack of Fudge Brownie Bars vied for my affections. Despite the predicament I faced, in my heart, I knew that S'mores Cookie was the one. Despite being outrageously full, I still forked out $3 for this monstrous delight and devoured it within the next 15 minutes as I strolled down the Highline. The not too soft, crispy texture, generous amount of chocolate chips and the hints of marshmallows, was just heavenly. It wasn't sickeningly sweet(thank god) at all! My intuition was right. S'mores Cookie is the one.

Perhaps it would be more enticing to order from here if the pizza dough wasn't devoid of flavor, or the tomato sauce wasn't sickenly sweet, but so far this place hasn't found their balance yet.

The pastries appear to be fresh, and the ones I had (pork bun and a fried pastry with a meat filling the name of which I do not know in English) were tasty.

"Alright, this place is absolutely trendy looking. The fans are cool. The music is civil, and it all screams hipster in the best way ( I swear it's a complement). However, I'm a bit saddened by the food and drinks at this place. 

I had an old fashioned whiskey and had to struggle to drink it (because I damn well can't waste a $12 drink). It was too sweet, sickeningly so. 

The classic biscuit was good-which I would expect since it's the namesake of this establishment, but the maple butter again was just too sweet. Maple syrup is NOT the answer to everything. 

The mac n cheese was also very upsetting. It was undercooked, flavorless, and filled with too many peppers. I don't even know what to say. You can't be a southern comfort food and have bad Mac n cheese. Cool your noodles!

We started off with the Artichoke Dip, which arrived bubbling and piping hot.  It was our favorite plate and the highlight of our meal.  We also had the Buttermilk Pancakes (best pancakes I've ever had - whipped cream and syrup were NOT sickening sweet), the 5 Cheese Macaroni (very filling and yes cheesy), and the Baked Skillet Eggs (beware: lots of egg yolks).

The guacamole is expensive, but I do like that it was chunky instead of pureed like many other places. The prickly pear (frozen so kind of too sweet for me) and Calle Fresca are amazing (has cucumber so it's very refreshing).

"Okay so.
I've been hearing a LOTTA hype about David Chang and his Momofuku this and that and omg cereal milk.
This place did not live up to that hype, I'm afraid, but it was still good. But maybe this hype is dying down, there was no one in the shop when we stopped by Thursday evening.

Cereal milk soft serve is definitely a really cool idea, but I personally didn't love it. It's corn flake cereal milk, which is basically the most boring cereal to flavor milk with, and I found myself feeling a bit sick of it after just a few tastes of my friend's ice cream. I do like that they include crunchies at the bottom of the cup and coat part of your ice cream with some crunchies as well.
I was confused by the ""cereal milk kits"" they were selling. Isn't the key to cereal milk just... cereal and milk? What do I know about it, it's more likely that it was some kind of cool powder, I am guessing.

I got the SUPER hyped up crack pie slice.
I would describe it as basically a baklava-y custard-consistency pie. Like... it was good. I like baklava. I like custard-filling-type pies (holla pumpkin pie!). I liked the crack pie.
It was VERY VERY sweet, though. I couldn't even finish my entire slice. I think if I had a lighter dinner I would've been able to finish it more easily.
But I didn't understand the hype. It was good, but it wasn't ahmaaaaahzing.

At first my friends wanted Debasaki or Mad for Chicken, but their kitchen closed much earlier (at 12am) than Pelicana's (which closes at 1:30am) so it was a good time to finally try this place out! 

The 4 of us thought we were real champs and ordered what seemed like very little food at first to an overwhelming amount when it was served. No kidding, their portion is actually pretty big, so they definitely don't skim you on the chicken like most friend chicken joints. 

We ordered one whole chicken, half garlic and half BBQ. Not the fan of the garlic but the BBQ was good. And yes, a WHOLE chicken.. so expect this to be enough for two people. 

We also ordered a bunch of other wings, out of all flavors spicy soy garlic was my favorite. The spiciness didn't linger and burn, so it was quite awesome. 

My friend ordered the fish cake soup which was DELICIOUS. It was quite spicy because it had jalapenos but it seems like the perfect go-to soup when you're sick. The soup itself was light and had a lot of yummy veggies.

I'm a fairly regular customer here, but this is only for convenience reasons, but now that Kaiser has opened up a few blocks away on 3rd Avenue, I will be visiting this establishment less.

The food is pretty good, although the pastries are too sweet.

What is prompting this mediocre rating is the hygiene of the waitstaff.  Firstly this morning, I was seated by the hostess who reeked of perfume, I almost choked and the perfume permeated the food.  The server was dirty; her white shirt looked as if it had not been washed in a long time, complete with yellow underarm stains; her black pants were shiny on the butt, and had long blonde hairs over them.  Her makeup (dark black eyeliner) looked uncouth, as well as her chipped purple nail polish.  I could not finish my meal, however, the plus side is that it is a good way to stick to a diet.  I looked at other servers; the males looked clean enough.  It is sickening when servers do not look wholesome, and it makes me wonder if they are noticeably dirty on the outside, what about their underneath hygiene.

"This is an odd development. Soldier McGee's is GONE. POOF. History.  I walk past the joint and there was a doorman, in the tradition of the new ADT ads. He was not saying a word, and was getting weather beaten. I ventured over for a question: 'Hey what's happening over here?'  He replied, ""whatever it was before, it is totally different now.""  I went to check out the Food Menu, and there was none. GONE are the three dollar sliders...GONE are my Caprese and Mozzluna sandwiches when I was 'trying' to let ""her"" know I am a 'vegetarian'. *wink wink*

Cue the Pinocchio nose.

I opened the doors, heard some insanely sick underground-ish hip-hop music (Company Flow, Aesop Rock, tha Liks), and noticed GONE are the televisions...No NYC Homegames for you.  

The place is near empty. There are two parties, one couple, and a dude at the bar. Behind the bar there was a bartender. She was still in her Hogwartz studies, steadily gazing her textbooks with bottles in hand. Her Bar Manager, not trying to jump in, was giving her audibles the whole time. Oh, I will be right with you. No eye contact. Not even an arching of her back to show off her Emma Stone frontal look. 

She came over to me like twenty minutes later. I cleared a level of Pokemon on my Nintendo 3D XL.  Still she came over with no smile, and was like 'what can I get you?' 

I reply, "" Just a Founders and Burger-Medium Rare."" And she exhaled soooorrry. It hit me like Nickelodeon Slime. We have no Burgers, just  a family meal. The Bar Manager quickly piped in 'Chicken and Rice.' I am already defalted, so 'sure' just broke the inertia.

The Beer board is the who's who of hipster brewskis...GONE are the three buck Coors and wings deal! 

The couple to my right, resembled the two from the television show, Portlandia. She asks about which beers are Gluten Free, but rocks a Dog Fish Ale. Her fella kept asking about bourbon, while the fella serving them kept drawing him back to the Basil Bourbon. And the hipster complied. 

The chicken and rice came in, maybe, a 16 oz Ramekin bowl. Stewed chicken on top of white rice. GONE are my Mac-n-Cheese wedges. But i liked the 'family meal.'
Mainly because it was bland. No extra salt to make me 'hey I need another beer.' Not spicy, or exotic enough to be like mami, ok let's do a shot. No it was as advertised. A family meal. With a beer. I would do another bowl some time. 

The two set me back 15 bucks. Not bad. With E's Bar down the street. Especially with their $5-ish menu. That is not par by several dozen strokes.

GONE are the Dart boards, but not at E's Bar.

This new bar needs a personality, and a hearbeat. It has potential though.

Oh and the young batender this smile and perk up when asking me if I wanted another beer...

"Momofuku Duck 6 course Prix Fixe? Uhmmm yes, please!! So happy this exists! One of the best momofuku meals I've had, I even enjoyed it more than Ko's tasting! You need a reservation of at least 11 people and you have to pay 1/2 the cost upfront for this dinner. Worth it! 

First course was fluke w/ sunflower, chayote, and chicharron. This was a subtle dish, a very light start to the meal. Followed by second course of country ham w/ redeye gravy and liver mousse, pickles, and bread. Omg the country ham was amazing...thinly sliced and salty and delicious with the gravy. The liver mousse was incredibly rich and smooth. Eating things that rich make you feel sick but it's such a good pain. The pickled peppers, tomatoes, etc. helped balance out the flavors really well. 

Third course was octopus escabeche with crostinis and honeycrisp apply kimchi My friends really enjoyed this but I'm not used to the cold octopus texture so it threw me off a bit. Flavors still great tho. However, the apple kimchi was incredible. Best kimchi I've ever had!! The kimchi flavor was strong but the apple still shone through and it was incredibly crisp and tasty. Ahhh I miss this one...

Fourth course was dual steamed buns. One classic one w/ pork belly, hoisin, etc. and a buffalo'd pork belly with bleu cheese and hot sauce. Getting full by now but can't stop eating... Classic pork belly bao was solid as expected from the Momofuku chain. The buffalo pork belly bun was super unique! The pork belly was coated in a crispy, buffalo skin-type exterior and was really good. 

Now for the star of the course!!!! A whole rotisserie duck with chive pancakes, lettuce, rice, and chilled Chinese broccoli. It was HUGE and amazing! Made my life. The rotisserie duck had a layer of pork sausage stuffed under the skin at a 1:1 ratio, because you know, that's not excessive or anything. Delicious duck juices soaked into the rice underneath and the scallion pancakes were chewy and yummy. Made little wraps out of them. As a group of 12 we maybe finished 1/3 of the dish. It was intense. Meat sweats and all. We were pretty much ashamed of ourselves at this point but gotta round everything out with dessert, right? 

Popcorn Cake!! Tosi is a genius. It seems a little unappealing but her thing for sweet and salty is my jam. It was a small, round layer cake with caramel corn, strawberry jam, and a decently strong popcorn flavor. Mixed feelings from the group but I really liked it. Overall, this dinner was an experience. Go with good company and you'll definitely have a great time with the amazing food. At 100pp after tax and tip I wouldn't do it aaaaall the time, but I'd definitely be down to go again after I take a couple months to digest everything and lose the 10 lb I gained that night.",0.0
"Got a menu of this place in our mailbox here at the office and sick of Ginza and the hour plus wait for deliver decided to give these guys a shot.  They had a deal where if u order online the first time you get either free Shumai or Edamame.  
   Got the 3 roll lunch special. I like that they give you soup AND salad because like the commercial says and is better than or. The Miso soup was good, not too watery and the salad was very good as well with cucumber and cherry tomatoes instead of just iceberg.  The rolls were decent size and very fresh. Got the Snow Crab Avocado (never saw that roll on a lunch special menu before), Yellowtail Scallion and Spicy Tuna. I would recommend all of them. The free Shumai I chose were also very good with the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely order from them again ven if they are a bit more expensive than Ginza.",0.0
"My sister and I came here for lunch because we had heard so many things about the xiao long bao! As someone who lives in LA and California in general, I feel like I, as well as my sister, have high expectations for Asian food since it's so prevalent where we live. Especially with places like Din Tai Fung and Mama Lu's in the greater LA area, it's hard to find a place to surpass them. Joe's Shanghai did a mighty fine job I must say. It is an authentic Chinese restaurant with awesome and decent prices. I was not expecting this for New York City even despite the fact that it's in Chinatown. My sister and I shared one order of the crab xiao long bao and seafood pan fried noodles. The xiao long bao was yummy. Perfect amount of crab and pork mixed with the soup. I'm usually one to get sick of them pretty quickly, so it was good we shared. The noodles were also enjoyable. I liked that they were crunchy, and you can drown them the yummy thick sauce. 

We got seated right away despite the fact that we came in during lunch time! It was a little odd to share a round table with other people not part of our party, but it's a pretty small restaurant, so it makes sense they were just trying to be efficient and maximizing their space. Good service, they are attentive and quick.",0.0
"I met my sister here with my husband for lunch around 12.30/1pm. It was incredibly dead, which was great being it offered a more intimate setting. This not the case for brunch on the weekends though, it is incredibly crowded. I wouldn't dream of coming on a Saturday. The atmosphere is incredibly cozy- almost like a cabin feel, with a lit fireplace, garlands of lights and moose/plaid decor (granted, it is December). Its located in Soho, which has amazing shopping just steps away. Its a great place to bring out of town parents or a casual date, with the neighborhood being so appealing and having much to do afterwards. 

The service and waiter we had was amazing. I'm gluten free and also semi- paranoid about eating out due to cross contamination. I get immensely sick if a knife even so touches a slice of bread. He was very accommodating and ensured me that the kitchen staff would take extra precaution in making my food. I ordered from the seconds,""the omelette, oyster mushroom, comte cheese, frisée"" as well as off the fresh pressed juice menu, ""the green clean"" (kale, spinach, cucumber, lime, apple, pineapple, and mint). The juice, hands down, was my favorite thing I ordered. It was incredibly fresh, wonderful combination of fruits/ vegetables and of course the perfect hint of mint. I wouldn't call the food incredibly memorable, but the presentation was great and tasted well enough. 

I would definitely come back, just for the service alone. 1 star off, just because my omelette lacked some oomph.",0.0
"I came by because I was looking for a quicker, healthier option and just a little sick of Chipotle at the time. Open Kitchen seems to be the trend of bigger, brighter lunch hot bar upgrade. The usual weird mix of strange foods replaced with grilled chicken and salmon and ringed by different food stations and juice bar.

I went to the salad station and built my own, for 10 dollars was a pretty good deal considering I loaded it up with veggies and got an extra meat for no additional charge. A solid place I would go to again if I was in the area and looking for that quick, healthy choice again.",0.0
"I love Mooncake Foods. My office is a block away and this is a go-to spot for lunch and (if working late) dinner. I have only eaten at the restaurant once because I prefer to do take out and delivery to my office. The food is always fresh and homemade tasting. I love all of their sauces like the spicy lemongrass dressing that comes with the broiled salmon salad - delicious! The wonton soup is also very satisfying when I am feeling run down - you can get it with or without egg noodles depending on how hungry you are. I love the peashoot and garlic wonton soup without noodles. This dish leaves me feeling healthy, light, and if I'm sick, cured! They also have a great selection of teas and drinks. I will continue to be a regular here.",0.0
"Ok, so this is your standard Midtown Deli owned by Koreans, but serving American Salads & Buffet options and Japanese Udon & Sushi.  Needless to say, you don't come here for exceptional and tasty food, but rather edible lunch food at a decent price.  Food is nothing to write home about, but not terrible either, just ok in my opinion.  

So here's my review for:

Salads: meh, go to Free Foods a few doors down instead.  It's more expensive, but the quality is 10x, yes 10x, better.  If you get a salad here at Cafe 45, it's cause you can't afford to spend an extra $4 for better quality vegetables, or you're just down right cheap.

Buffet: my Life Motto which has served me well has been to ""Never Eat from a Buffet and Never Go on a Cruise"".  They basically go hand-in-hand...lots of ill-mannered people touching & sneezing on everything, increasing the chance I contract the Norovirus...pass.

Sushi: actually not bad, even though it's essentially fake sushi, being prepared by a Korean guy who I see constantly chain smoking outside the storefront - otherwise known as ""cigarette sushi"" at my work. Not the best name for a sushi spot, but look, I've been to plenty of 5-star sushi spots in the city, as well as in the Tokyo fish market, but given the horrendous sushi options in the neighborhood (Azusa, Cafe Zaiya, etc.), I've resorted to eating at the ""White Castle of Sushi"" - at least it's edible and I haven't gotten sick (yet), and cheap - $12 for 4 large salmon sushi pieces and a sushi avocado roll.

Udon and Stir Fry: actually very good noodles, especially in the winter time, and the broth has a good flavor and good additions (beef, chicken, shrimp, etc).  This is what you come for, don't bother with anything else, unless you need a sushi fix, which like I said, is not bad.

So, come here for the Udon, Stir Fry or Sushi (if you have to), as well as any other convenience store items you might need, but don't come here expecting to be blown away or saying, ""that was amazing, I'm coming back again""...more like, ""that wasn't bad, I guess I could do it again sometime if I have to"".",0.0
"I love this place. It is my go-to lunch delivery when I don't bring my own lunch to work. Their prices are so cheap considering that I always feel full, satisfied and GOOD instead of sick and bloated (how I usually feel after typical delivery in midtown). Every once in awhile delivery seems to take over 30 min (rare) but even then my food is always hot & tastes freshly made. I suggest the chicken pita sandwiches, either with guacamole or spinach and tomato sauce. Also the egg sandwiches! Only thing I would not suggest is the sweet potato pie, which tasted like it was made with sweet&low. Food tastes like real food and makes you feel good - without spending a lot.",0.0
"Finding decent food around midtown for lunch can be difficult, especially when you're sick of Korean food from 32nd street. 

Knowing that Trattoria Bianca offered decent lunch specials, I was down. 

There is plenty of food to be shared, it's Italian after all. 

The squid ink pasta did not live up to my expectations. I did not taste any sea urchin butter, just regular butter. They had a decent amount of scallops, shrimp and clams though. They were in pretty big chunks too.

Lobster rolls were pretty meh. Sure the portions of lobster is fair but it lacked flavor. The dish was bland. The wrap they used was pita bread? Dry and powdery which enforces the bland taste. I'd skip it if I were you. 

The minestrone soup was decent, a mix of kale and other greens. The soup was light. 

All in all 3 stars, food is passable but not fantastic just like its overall rating of 3.5.",0.0
"Made the mistake of getting my black label burger cooked medium well the first time around.  I like my burger pink and juicy, but lately when I order medium at other places, i get a half mushy burger, and i'm sick of it.

I had to go back a 2nd time to order medium given the great overall reviews.  $26 for a burger and fries is still overpriced, but it's definitely one of the best burgers i've ever had.  The grilled onions have an excellent, somewhat sweet flavor.  Only complaint is that it was a bit salty overall.  Always a good sign when you don't need cheese to make a burger, though.

The fries are standard crispy thin fries.  They give you a ton, so at the least, it's a filling meal.  I much prefer these to soggy steak fries.  Nothing special, though.

If you don't want to wait, go late on a Sunday night (say 9 PM).  Had no trouble getting a table.  On any week night, you'll either wait around 45 min for a table, or have to settle for the cramped bar.  As others have said, they do take reservations.

The service is decent, and they have a nice drink menu.  Atmosphere definitely takes you back in time to a jazz club-like setting in the late 50s / early 60s.  Worth trying at least once, and going back if you get a craving.",0.0
"My sister decided to try this place rather than go to her usual spot, down the block, across the street.  She bought rotisserie chicken and some pernil.  It was pretty good..

One day I decide to get some soup from this place.  I was feeling sick and did not feel well enough to make my own chicken soup.  I ordered two quart containers of soup, one for me and one for my sis.  I saw that she had to lift the hotel pan in order to scoop out the soup from the bottom.  To me it meant that it was a big seller.  It also came with a small container of rice.  When I got home, I saw it was mostly liquids and not much chicken, noodles or veggies.  I paid $14 for two quarts of liquids, albeit tasty, it was not worth it.   

I'll stick with their chicken, which they roast by the window...you can see the chicken rotate and roast from the outside...a good marketing strategy....",0.0

"I would like you to know that I went with my husband and 3 children ages 7,5, and 2,  to the times Square location about a month ago. We were seated right next to the elevator since we requested a high chair.  We asked for a booth and we're told we could not have one since we were not 5, when in fact we were 5 people. With that said we sat and looked at the menu at which time every other table in our section started complaining.  The waitress had charged everyone wrong,  and gave everyone inacurrate checks.  One lady's card was charged twice for her table and for another table.  A second woman asked for the manager since her check was completely wrong.  As the manager came by we called him over as well asking again if we could switch our seats,  it had now been 20 mins and we hadn't even been approached by this waitress once.  He moved us a few tables away to another section when the waitress proceeded to yell at us that we can't switch our section she was our waitress and we were to be served by her.  My husband and then asked her why she hadn't even approached us and she said she was handling problems.  She then went to the the other waitors and waitresses who were congregated against the wall and told them not to serve us.  My husband then walked over the the manager who said he would help.  After another 15 minutes of not being helped we walked out.  What kind of service does your establishment strive for?  My three children were hungry and we waisted a total of 45 minutes not being helped.  I will never go back there and I will tell everyone I know not to go back either.  What kind of place denies children food.  I'm sickened to even think of the type of employees you have working there.",0.0

"For all you health junkies out there, its just best to avoid this place altogether. 
As a former employee, I know what I'm talking about.

I don't feel honest working there, its why I left. The juices are way healthier than the smoothies.They are the only one with no added sugar!

As for the smoothies, they are made with fruit that are packaged and sent to us in SUGAR.
The raspberries and blueberries are a puree. The ingredients on the container says BLUEBERRIES,SUGAR or RASBERRIES,SUGAR. 

So when you ask if we add sugar the answer is no BECAUSE IT COMES TO US IN SUGAR, WE DONT ADD ANY MORE!!!

Also, the papaya, mango,apple, orange, kiwi, grape,lemon all come from a pump in a bottle. No actual fruit goes into your smoothie if you order one with one of these items in it!

I've had customers ask for just a mango smoothie and it sickens me that I know what they will be drinking! Not actual mango and ice blended but some kind of artificial syrup and some water and ice is what they truely will be getting.

Also I've had reason to believe that the immune, fiber, and immunity blasts are fake. Its just water and food coloring. The only blast that's real is the protein blast. Its really protein. Whey to be exact. The fake blasts are just a ruse to squeeze more money out of you($1 addt.!!!!!) for thinking it might actually be beneficial for your health. 

So here's my advice:
ALWAYS ASK FOR FRESH FRUIT!
Order the ones from the front of the counter in the display section. 

And forget about those damned blasts. 
As a matter of fact, just don't come here at all. 
Spend your money elsewhere.

"I'm here to declare, to confirm, co-sign, to validate that The Queens Kickshaw has the BEST DAMN grilled cheese in possibly the WORLD. I had the guoda grilled cheese that came in thick, toasted, buttery slice bread, gouda cheese (of course) with pickled jalapenos, GUAVA paste, black bean hummus and a side order of a small salad but a FRESH salad. It was DELICIOUS. No, wait, it was HEAVEN!! I was with my date and was a little jealous that the mozzarella and cheddar grilled cheese she had took away the orgasm I was supposed to give her that night. DAMN. I ain't mad though, because the yumminess of my grilled cheese sandwich hit me in the balls.

We followed it with ginger cream brule, bread pudding, affogato and peach cobbler. I honestly wish I was better at describing the texture, taste and feel of food but I'm not so good at explaining it. If I had to explain the dessert in Laymans terms, it'll be: D-D-D-D-DAMN!!!! I also had an espresso, which is no joke. Not your Star Bucks espresso kids, its as authentic as it gets here.

This place has a very unique look to it. I'll describe it as hipster-chicish. It's cozy, dimly lit with candles at each table, a small bar in the front and all sorts of eclectic music plays throughout the day/night. 90's hip-hop, death metal, 90's pop, music of this era. Interesting. The people who work here are always friendly, with a smile and attentive. Always really nice and don't skip a beat.

Either way, this place is good for all sorts of occasions: Dates, regular hangouts or meetups, quick bite to eat, etc. If you live in Astoria or even if you don't, come check this place out and try the grilled cheese!

"I've come to Fish before at happy hour to take advantage of the ""Red, White, & Blue"" happy hour special which is a dozen raw oysters or clams and a beer or glass of wine for $8. It's a good deal. 

We've also explored other parts of the menu. Specifically, we had the ""angels on horseback"" (raw oyster wrapped in bacon and topped with horseradish) and the lobster mac and cheese. Now, I'm a mac and cheese snob but I actually liked this mac. It's pretty tasty and there was a lot of lobster. Most recently, I came to Fish on the coldest day of the year for dinner with two colleagues. They had a limited oyster selection because all the water in the surrounding areas were frozen solid, so... Lol. Instead, we decided to try soups and sandwiches. I got the chicken and seafood gumbo, which is really more like a chicken soup with shrimp and some diced onions and celery. It was good, though. The cup is served in a mug and it's a pretty big mug so you get a fair portion of soup. Unfortunately the night I went, I must've gotten the dregs of the pot because there was no chicken in my soup. It was mostly broth, veggies, and like two shrimp, but the broth was absolutely delicious and since I'd been sick it was pretty much what the doctor ordered. My companions ordered lobster rolls and I got an oyster roll. Let me tell you -- this may have been one of the best seafood sandwiches I've ever had. There bread was tasty and was loaded with perfectly seasoned fried oysters. The French fries served with the sandwiches are fried to perfection. I hate a soggy fry, but these were well-salted, crunchy and golden brown. A real treat. The sandwiches also come with a salad that is more interesting than your regular side salad. Lettuce, tomato, cabbages, cucumber, carrot, etc., and was dressed with the yummiest creamy salad dressing and just the right amount of it. All that for $13?! Yes, please!

"This is my go to sushi place in flushing because it's very convienent to get to. It's right on Main Street and also they offer the all you can eat sushi buffet which includes kitchen food as well as sushi and sashimi. Most places do not include sashimi in their sushi buffet and as a lover of salmon sashimi, I always go there to order that! A special roll that is probably really bad for you but amazingly delicious is the Godzilla! And I also love the rock shrimp appetizer and the chicken yaki udon! And the best part is definitely the finishing touch: GREEN TEA ICE CREAM. If you don't want the all you can eat, there are also lunch specials! The salmon teriyaki is pretty good and it comes with quite a lot! The only thing I would say is not to order too many rolls because it'll make you sick if you eat too much. River is the kind of restaurant that when you finish you probably feel like you're going to explode or you have a bad stomach ache from being too full but you keep going back there because they have all you can eat salmon sashimi and green tea ice cream.",0.0
"This should be no stars.

Hi fellow yelpers, please avoid this place! My friend and i was really craving congee so we searched up a place that would serve congee at night. This place came up so we decided to go even after reading bad reviews. Okay there's a reason why the restaurant only has a B rating outside their door from the Health Department. Don't get fooled by their bright sign. 

The wait was fairly short, about 10 minutes. It seemed really crowded and very touristy. When our seats were ready... Guess where they seated us, literally in a box. This room is smaller than your bathroom probably. It was with two other tables of two... Seriously?! It was practically their storage room. 

Their menu was pretty decent I would say. Seafood was very tempting but I was sick so I couldn't have any. I just wanted congee. We ordered a medium congee with filet and preserved egg and also a tofu seafood casserole. 

The casserole came first surprisingly. Well actually unsurprisingly it was warm, not hot at all. It was drenched in salt as well. The congee came and I was so excited because I was looking forward to this! The waiter served us the congee in two smaller bowls. Wait it gets better... As I'm about to eat my first spoonful of congee, I see a strand of hair. WTF. Seriously?! The waiter was ""shocked"" and said he'll bring a new one out. 10 mins later, he comes back with a ""new"" bowl. You can tell it's not new since scallions were mixed already. Okay so I'm about to finally enjoy my congee and.... I SEE A NEW PIECE OF HAIR. 

Okay this was ridiculous. We told him and not only did the waiter no apologize, he said oh we'll just cancel it then and walked off. 

We asked for the check and tried to pay exact change so we can just leave but we didn't have smaller bills. We gave the guy 20.37 for a bill of 17.37. So a normal person would bring back $3 change right? Yeah uh he came back with $2 and $1 of coins. Oh yes, we made a scene because he was obviously playing games.

"Well the girls of Sex and the City definitely never came here for brunch. Are you sick of just eating the same old silly pancake and drinking Bloody Marys while you talk about last night's shenanigans?

It's time to mix it up! Walking in, you'll feel like you entered a magic portal to Sri Lanka. The interior is INCREDIBLE. Literally everything is imported from Sri Lanka. The walls are made of stone, there are Buddha statues everywhere, and even the menus are pasted on wooden faces. 

My friend and I came here for the buffet. Which for $13.95 is a steal considering it's all you can eat and all that will get you in most places is an omelette and a drink. There were about 10-15 dishes including kale and coconut, deviled chicken, spicy green beans, egg curry, dal, spicy coconut, eggplant, spicy yucca, plus an array of mousses for dessert. 

Every single I ate was delicious. I was raised with Indian food and for a long time I figured Sri Lankan food is similar. NOT the case. While somewhat similar, Sri Lankan food definitely stands on its own. Honestly, we just kept eating and eating and eating. 4 hours later we realized we were the last ones standing.

It's definitely worth the trek from the other boroughs. 

BUT I'm subtracting one star because THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY HOPPERS!! What the heck guys??? That's what Sri Lankan breakfast is known for. We couldn't even order one. That made me pretty effing sad. However as my pants were about to burst open, maybe it was a sign from the Universe.",0.0
"I went on a Saturday with a group of ten other people. I walked in and was greeted by a bouncer, who checked ID and asked me to not be so soft spoken, since ""it's not a secret that you're here."" 

 We had a reservation for 11:30 AM, but our party wasn't complete until around 11:50, so we started drink service about twenty minutes into the reservation. This was pretty well played on our part, since your two hours begin as soon as your first drink hits the table, so we bought ourselves a little extra time. I had the French Toast BEC, which came with home fries and a salad. This dish seemed to be the greatest bang for your buck, since it came with all of these extras, and you just had to pay the standard prix fixe ($40 + tax + 20% gratuity). At the end of our meal, we paid over $550 for our meals, and left a pretty decent tip for our waitress, since she was so accommodating to our party. We had ten minutes left on the clock when she brought out some more Bellinis and champagne bottles, so that we would be able to take them to the back, which was great! 

Once we got to the back, someone in our group got a little sick and threw up in the bathroom. Once this happened, the bouncer told us that she had to go, because she was ""f***ed up"" and ""didn't have her s**t together"". One of my friends told the bouncer that as an institution that promotes unlimited drinking, the establishment should ensure that every patron is SAFE before being thrown out onto the street. She also let him know that as a graduate of a women's college and a feminist, she was disappointed in PS450's policy. How do you throw a vulnerable young woman out onto the street without checking to see if she is okay? I hope that this is not what usually happens here, but based on my experiences with people standing outside the establishment, it seems to be. 3 stars for the great waitress and good food, and -2 stars for a misogynistic (and unjust) policy. 

We stayed about 40 extra minutes after our friend was kicked out (AFTER making sure she was safely in an Uber back to Brooklyn), at which point PS450 was basically just turning into a dance club. Quite the experience.",0.0

Only draw back was when we asked to pay they wouldn't take our card since our meal was less than $25, so I had to go to the ATM next door ($2.50 fee) to pay. Definitely recommend.",0.0
"I thought it was about time I reviewed this place, seeing as I have been here about 7 times since April when I moved into the neighborhood. I live right across the street from Dulce Vida, and it was the first place I went to for brunch the weekend we moved in. Service is spot on and consistent every time, and the food is extremely simple and basic. It's very cheap (less that $15 for a meal and coffee) and the espresso is very good by my standards ($3 for a double shot). I get sick of bread with everything (especially as NYC bread seems very sweet to me), so I enjoy getting the arepa with my eggs. I usually have a 3 egg omelette and the fillings are plentiful; there's at least half an avocado in there, 3 rashes of crispy bacon and many mushrooms. You also get fresh fruit for no extra cost and it's never old and gross- always fresh. Avocado is never old and brown. It's these little things I look for when the food is basic- simple things done right.",0.0
"This is probably one of my favorite ramen options in the city, but I'm pretty sick of it because I'm forced to come here every single time someone swings by to visit NYC. And then I have to wait in line. And wait. And wait. And wait longer. And wait some more. At 5pm. At 10pm. There's always a wait. I've probably tried every single bowl of ramen on the menu in an effort to not bore myself to death. Surprisingly, the vegetarian ramen is actually my favorite. It looks like a salad in the bowl, true, but the soup is delightfully light and flavorful. I usually always suffer post-ramen stomachaches from the fattiness of the soup (which is my favorite part of ramen, so I can't help but slurp it all down before even touching any other component), but I'm safe after the mushroom-y broth of the vegetable ramen. And adding avocado to ramen is so brilliant that I want it in there every time. But come to think of it, when is adding avocado NOT a brilliant idea?",0.0
"I love ramen to death so I naturally thought I would fully embrace a ramen burrito. The place was packed on a Sunday afternoon and the glass windows were all fogged up with the wonderful aromas that filled the restaurant. As I was picking up my order, the gal at the register warned me that it was sitting there for a while. They had prepared it right away when they received my order, which was 1.5 hours before the actual pick up time I set. So you mean, my order is going to be a soggy, lukewarm burrito accompanied with a lukewarm tea? Props for being eager but there is a reason why we set pick up times.

Anywho, within a few bites into my pulled pork ramenritto, I was sadly sick of it, especially of the noodles. It seemed like it weighed 5 pounds but none of the ingredients stood out. It might have been a better experience if it was shared. My tea machiatto with passion fruit syrup was good though. Eat24 had an option to choose your type of milk and I was initially confused at first. Later, I realized the drink doesn't contain milk. (I had selected soy milk that was an extra quarter. Whoops.) My bf got the same lunch special but got the white chocolate apricot scone while I got a cranberry one. His was good! It was sweet and had a nice bite to it. I found mine to be bland and a little under baked in the middle.

I came to the conclusion that I was glad I tried it. Nothing more.",0.0
"One of my favorite Japanese sushi places for takeout. I was really impressed by the qulity of their sushi when I firts got it from there. It is a small spot so I was not expecting to eat something really great, I was just starving and neede to eat something really quick. 

They went beyond my expectations, sushi were fresh and yummy. I have also tried their ramen and soups. They were also very tasty, but their sushi are just sick.",0.0
"I have been a consistent customer since they opened. Love their soup and smoothies/juices and even the vegan ice cream, which was a first for me... Their burgers are also great. If you're sick, get the flu knockout; it's intense, but it'll fix you right up. Most importantly, the staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. Will keep coming back for sure. Wish they had outlets so I could work there for more than an hour as it's a pleasant place to get a little work done.",0.0
"It's so hard for me to write this review (so I put it off for so long) because I don't know what to say besides that it is amazing. I have always had a huge soft spot for Chang and I love whatever is happening in his brain and his heart for food. So pretty much Ko has been at the top of the list for restaurants I need to try. 

It was pretty straightforward getting a reservation, just needed good timing. Came here with my amazing sister for my birthday dinner. It was everything I could have imagined. 

The attention to detail per course was incredible. I loved being able to watch the chefs prepare and plate each dish. Each course got progressively richer and richer until we hit the shaved foie gras--I think that was my tipping point. Anything else that savory would have made me feel sick so it was the perfect transition point to desserts/sweets. My favorites at the time were probably the mackeral sabazushi (best piece of sushi I've ever had), soft scrambled egg, and the lamb. I also got a birthday cupcake that had some notes of ginger and it was delicious. Best birthday cupcake :) 

Do this at least once ever. Unless you have dat cash money then do it all the time!! Carlos was da bomb, it was fun chatting with him as he prepped the food.",0.0
"This place is so great and I have so much free time right now that I'm writing ANOTHER REVIEW to holler to the damn sky that The Cottage dishes up some of the finest fast Chinese food to hit that naughty, hungover, sloppy craving you and your friends and family get sometimes when you're sick of ""being good"" with your mug shoved into a juice from Organic Avenue up the block or a little cheap-ass piece of frozen salmon you cooked up with some organic broccoli from Whole Foods when you tricked yourself into thinking cooking was a realistic part of your life in NYC. Damn you good, The Cottage. I want to get in there in the kitchen and learn from you, but I'm watching Seinfeld on Hulu and I know you'll get to my door in 15 minutes no matter what I order so I'm not going to come in and cook sesame chicken with you. No! No, Ima stay here and wait for my main man to ring the doorbell and drop off my food. I love you.

Thanks, The Cottage, for knocking it so far out of the ballpark I came back and wrote this follow up review.",0.0
"I've been here multiple times for fresh salmon, and each and every time, they do not disappoint. They definitely get the full 5 stars for consistency. I've been going here since 2013 so I keep track of their service. If it starts to go downhill, I'm out of there! 

The nicest, older couple are so sweet and are always amazed at how much salmon we buy in bulk -- usually 3 or 4 slabs, occasionally some white fishes. 

Not only are they polite and friendly, but they are also very accommodating, in the sense that if you ask for little things like extra bagging and extra ice packs, they do it no problem. No attitude or anything. And considering how much we are spending, it's refreshing when people actually remember customer service. 

Super clean place too, never have to worry about the fish not being fresh enough, cold enough, or bugs flying around because their fish is enclosed in cases instead of in the open, laid out on ice. As soon as you walk in, the small place looks organized (which is a good sight to see!), with all the fish on the right, and other assortments of lobster tails, shrimps, frozen foods, in coolers on the left. The floor isn't wet or slimy. It doesn't stink of fish, like the Chinatown fish market area. I never get sick from it, and I've eaten it raw when I made salmon sushi rolls. So it's good whether cooked or not! 

Definitely worth a visit!",0.0
"Taverna Kyclades is a welcome addition to the East Village.  Besides Pylos, there really aren't many good Greek restaurants in the neighborhood.  Kyclades menu is simple but will satisfy you if you are looking for some good seafood that won't cost you and arm and a leg.  

Choose from a wide array of fishes and have it prepared to your liking.  I enjoy getting the Kyclades special because it gives you a bit of everything.  There aren't an overwhelming amount of appetizer options but the spanakopita here is the best I've ever had.  It's like a stuffed spinach slice of pizza but better.  I have to get this every time I come.  The mussels are really enjoyable too.  Typically cheese and seafood don't mix well but hey, they're Greek.  Feta Cheese goes on everything.  Ask for some extra bread to sop up the rich cheesy tomato sauce left over.  

The only downfall of this place is that it always smells like Chinatown out front the next morning.  I guess they put all their garbage out on the street which includes all the seafood that didn't get eaten, creating an unpleasant fishy smell for a few hours.  They should probably try and do something about that because it might make people question the quality of their seafood, even though it appears to be top notch.

All the portions here are really big so be mindful of that when ordering.  You can share an entree and an appetizer for two people.  Plus, they give you a free dessert which is a nice little bonus at the end of the meal to leave you with a sweet flavor in your mouth.  

Overall, I don't think anyone will be wowed by the food here but you will leave satisfied and feeling semi-healthy for a meal out.  If I'm in the mood for fresh grilled seafood, I'll come here. If I want some heavier Greek fare, I'll go to Pylos.  If I want a Gyro, I'll go to the nasty food truck across from the mosque on 11th and First that always gets me sick.  Gotta have options!!!",0.0

Lunch today was a lamb wrap from Anka grill. First the good. Pretty tasty quick service and a hair under $10. So now the bad. The lamb was tough which another reviewer also mentioned so may be the quality is not great.

Gross I should have said something but it happened too fast. I hope I Dont get sick. Yuchh.,0.0

"Asian Street Style meets Asian Street Food at this hip and happening bun eatery. This is a standing room only hole in the wall, perfect for late night post drinking snacks. These are rich and fatty morsels that can be eaten with the hands, the sauces are excellent and the meat fatty and crisp, the buns are soft and sweet just like you want them.

Given all the vegetables on their menu, I'm always deceived into thinking I've had such a healthy meal! :)",0.0
"Awesome place! For someone who is sick of the food around my campus (blocks away from here), discovering this place was heaven sent. Very affordable considering the fact that they are serving seafood. They give you heaping portions too. Not just a small little fish with a few chips. I've also tried their shrimp. It was well cleaned, perfectly deveined and tasted quite fresh. They are cooked in different batters which is very much appreciated. The shrimp batter is a little sweet and much thicker than the fish batter. As for the fish batter, it's a fairly thinner coat on the fish which keeps it nice and moist. Nothing is rubbery at all and they passed the ""fresh fish"" test! (Which is that the place doesn't smell like stinky fish). This place is also quite tiny. No seating. And I know when people say that, they mean maybe a table with no seat, but for this place I really mean NO seating. No tables. Nothing. It's a ""just take it to go or eat it while you're walking"" place. I like that though. They have a small menu. Just a few select things that they know how to cook well. Another thing I love is that they dont push people to come in, it's all on word of mouth and loyal customers. They are very honest and they only want to serve people with good food for a good price.",0.0
"Uniquely separated into two sections. Friendly owner and great food and service. 

When your sick of Chinese food you come here. 
One of my favorite dishes is the ""Nest batter "" fried shrimp with their special sauce that has the consistency of ranch dressing with the taste of garlic.

Lychee Martini different and not too sweet. You also get a whole lychee to top it off. 
Jerk chicken is similar to the one I've tasted in Jamaica. Jamaica in  the Caribbean of course. 

On Sundays they BBQ outside in front of the building and it's made fresh with potatoe salad as well as green salad. Nice sized dish for 12 dollars.

"I've been to this place a few times before and shame on me for not reviewing earlier. 



Tong Tong Tonkatsu is great for, well, their tonkatsu, and they have various kinds to boast. I have had the Sweet potato, King Tonkatsu, fish tonkatsu, and the cordon bleu tonkatsu. 



The Cordon Bleu is good, but you get sick of it after a while because it is very cheesy. I would recommend splitting this with someone if you choose to get it and get a regular tonkatsu or fish tonkatsu to balance it out. 



Their portions are big and filling. We decided to get the 'mo mil' noodles today and you can add various ""sides"" to your main for an additional modest price.

"Probably one of the best buffets, though I'm getting sick of it. Think I might have went around 10 times since it opened already. I recommend going on weekends at night (more expensive) because they have lamb chops!! They're the best. They don't have a huge variety of foods in my opinion, but I love the crabs, and sashimis. They have a variety of food including soups, sushis, cotton candy machine, crepes, frozen yogurt, and other desserts. It looks really nice inside as well. Downside is that it is pretty pricey.",0.0
"We advertise this buffet at my workplace and when I see the ad from time to time, I always develop a craving to go back. I've only had one negative experience with one of the workers, where she re-filled all of the soup bowls for the people at my table except me. She re-filled them twice or more for everyone else but not once for me, even when I was pretty low on my soup. Not sure why that happened, but that's just one subpar experience. I've had great ones with everyone else I've encountered though.

I don't think I'll get sick of shabu shabu no matter how many times I have it, which is why this buffet is truly my type of place. I love the variety of leafy greens that they offer and the plethora of sauces, YUM! They also have a number of different types of fish cakes, which are all great. I love the selection of noodles. You can tell, I don't really have much negative comments about the food itself. Once everything hits the boiling hot soup base, it's just a matter of time until you get to fish those veggies out of the hot bath and realize that life is good. Also, meat is an option. There are different kinds of meat that are suitable for anyone.

It is pretty big inside and they have a generous amount of space for seats. I've never had a problem with any of the tables being too close to each other. Also, I'm grateful that they don't have a time limit. I'm able to enjoy my meal without being rushed to leave in an hour and a half. Overall, I'm a fan and I'll be back.",0.0
"POSITIVES:
Ample parking.

NEGATIVES:

Microwaved food. My friend was feeling sick and wanted pickles, when i asked the waiter for pickles he asked if its ok if he brought an order of ten (as if it was totally not possible to bring one or two) and my friend was feeling sick so I just quickly agreed. 

The pickles were frozen and not fully thawed; DISGUSTING! When we asked the waiter if we could take it back, he replied ""But I already charged you for it."", and just stood there awkwardly for what felt like an eternity. After standing there as if I just insulted his mother, he finally spoke to his manager and took the pickles back. Furthermore, the omelet was not very good, same story with the eggplant surprise or whatever it was called that we ordered as an appetizer. It tasted like eggplant flavored gum. 

I ordered a dirty martini and there was stuff floating on the bottom. Disgusting.

After a sub-par dining experience, I was at least expecting the cashier to be sort of friendly or something? Didn't happen. She was on the phone when she was ringing me up and rudely asked me if I want to leave a tip. I never stiff, so I left a tip. I said thank you, she gave me a cold shoulder. Just incredible. 

I called and let management know about my bad experience. I will call them back and let them know that I left this review.

One last thing: it was a rip off. I am no cheapo, if the food is good I am more than happy to pay. This was not this case at Georgia Diner. 

Furthermore, the crowd there is awful. There was a heavily tattoed man sitting at the bar that kept glaring at me as if he wanted to extort me for money I did not owe him (this guy was obviously making other customers feel uncomfortable as well).

This place will never change just because its been there so long and people will go there even if they serve cardboard, which is what those pickles tasted like. Go figure.",0.0

"I always get the #4 Spicy Beef Noodles here, but this time when I ordered it, the lady said, do I want it Stir Fried. I said, what? Stir Fried, she said, yes, they have a stir fried version.

She said, yes, it depends on what you like, so I ended up getting the stir fried version.

OMG - this is totally not the #4 version, it got crazy things in there, stuff that is not found in #4 and it's not even spicy. It was bland and really disappointing.

When people gives me options...seriously, that really Fs me up. BLEH.

"Had it not been for seamless webs promotion of 15% I would have never found this place. Meaning I ordered by accident thinking it was another sushi place. 

This place is hidden and it's in the basement. I'm giving it 4 stars based on my quick glance of the restaurant and the sushi rolls I received. I had spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and Cali rolls. I'd say it's safe because I didn't feel sick after (unlike another unnamed  flushing sushi place) and my rolls were pretty good. They came with salad!!

If ever the chance to order again, I would certainly try to dine in. Parking is hard in this area... I was at a hydrant and ran down and back out.",0.0
"By far the worse NYC eats. To be so close to the theater district and be so awful is a shame. 
First the service. At its lowest low when the waiters respond with ""huh""  when they are called. Disrespectful and unprofessional. 
The atmosphere... Disgusting if not horrid. You better be ready to hold your coat on your lap because no one will offer a coat check and when you ask for one they look at you like your the crazy one. The tables are squeezed up next to each other and you may find yourself sitting next to the refill station for dinner. 
Now the food.  We ordered the skirt stake which was to be served with mashed potatoes and a brown mushroom sauce. The stake was dry and Chewey I would have been better off eating my boot. The mashed potatoes,  made from a premix box you can find at path mark and not to leave out the mushroom sauce. With stake you would expect fresh mushrooms but ohhhh no canned mushrooms are good enough for the Brazilian Grill and they are happy to stick a $30.00 price on it.  
We had the garden salad as a start and it was just talked out of a spring mix box and into the plate. Nothing more to that.  So if you are happy paying $12 for just mixed greens with nothing else then please try this place but if you want a descent meal ask for everything else but the kitchen sick to prepare your own meal at the tables. 
Being so disappointed with our dinner we asked to speak to a manager to adress some of the issues we experienced at his restaurant.  When he came to our table not only was he rude but he didn't give a S#! T about what I was saying so instead he cut us off and said Okay i will take out the tip ( which was already included in our bill for a party of 2) yeap.... Be sure to read your bill carefully!!!!  
He then dismissed us and let another waiter handel it.  
If this is what the Brazilian culture and food is like I must say I am so disappointed and this place should be ashamed to call themselves a BRAZILIAN grill. 
Chipotle is a far better choice if you find yourself on 46fh and 8th",0.0
"Let me start by saying the food was delicious. Minus some very rare skirt steak, we loved everything we ordered. The reason I'm giving it two stars is because of kitchen cleanliness. When there was no table available we sat at the bar which faces the open kitchen. This was fine with us but after watching the prep we were very grossed out. The prep chef that cooks the meat, touches the meat with his bare hands which is fine, except that he just wipes his hands on a rag and never washes his hands. He then preps all the dishes and grabs salad and garnishes with those same raw meat hands and preps each dish. He then uses that same gross rag to clean the edge of each plate. My husband and I were so grossed out. Luckily we payed attention to this mostly after we were finished eating so it didn't completely ruin our meal. We were definitely nervous of being sick when we got home which luckily we weren't. Even though the food looks and tastes delicious, we won't be back due to how gross the prep in the kitchen was. We just couldn't believe when touching raw meat and fish, you would never wash your hands and use a dirty rag to clean your hands, clean your plates and touch your food. Yuck!",0.0
"Meh.  Went there New Years Eve.  We were the only diners in the restaurant.  Still, somehow the service managed to be slow and inattentive.  The entrees were entirely unremarkable.  The soups bland.  I saw the 4 1/2 star rating and was geared up for an excellent dining experience, but all I can think is that either they were having a way-off night, or other people rating this restaurant have different expectations.

"Let's start here: my absolute favorite food in the entire world, the food I want for my next meal, my last meal and every meal in between, the one thing I will never ever get sick of, is lox and bagel.  There is no food that I would choose over lox, or smoked fish anyway, if I can get it.  So was I happy to go to Russ and Daughers Café?  Seriously, you have to ask?  Alright, let's get to particulars.  The place is adorable and we didn't have to wait for a table.   It was decorated in the style of the store, all art deco and those cute signs. I liked seeing into the kitchen and seeing the bags of bagels, bialys, rolls, etc.  Everything was just so cute.  The service was attentive.  The food...well, I had sable and shared the herring sampler.  Did I love it?  Yes I did.  I thought the portion of sable was rather small for the price.  Also, shouldn't smoked fish come with cucumber? I think so, particularly in the winter when tomatoes are out of season (although their tomatoes were pretty good, considering).  I prefer Philly cream cheese to their own, but to each their own, right?  Everyone in my group seemed to love what they got.  So my only quibble with the food was: too expensive or too small portions, take your pick.  One person in my group felt the table was too tight, and it kind of was.  Still, since my DH is not a fan of Jewish ambrosia, I'll have to find someone else to accompany me, but I will be back.  The lines were a lot shorter than at the store.  Oh, and one other thing: please put belly lox on the menu.  I can't be the only person who likes it better than nova...",0.0
We came here on a Friday dinner as a group of 8. We enjoyed our time here! I was sick so I didn't try seafood but my friends did. It smells good.

Taste mild in sweet while rich in yum:) Would come back for seafood and dessert!,0.0
"Wednesday. Steak night. BOOM.

The steak deal is pretty on point. When you spend $10 on anything (drinks, snacks), their steak is only an additional $10.

I was told their seating could be limited but we got pretty lucky. The man who I assume was the owner (his son worked there too) was real cool and attentive. The type of bar/bar owner you wish you were a regular at (but I live too far).

Anyways, we ordered beer and fried pickles to fill up the initial $20 between the both of us. Didn't think I'd like the pickles but they were decent. Then the steak. Their steak is a sweet, tangy, delicious marinaded skirt (my favorite) with your choice of sides (fries, veggies, salad or mash). I ordered the mash and it was very flavorful. The steak seemed a bit too sweet and I thought I'd get sick of it but that never happened. It was good. It also comes with onions. Boy did I not regret. I think I cleaned my plate at half the time it took my roommate.

Overall, I cannot wait to go back.",0.0
"I use Duane Reade a lot. One of my neighbors actually works here and she is super sweet. The review is for the pharmacist manager, and she is horrible. I mean if one bad experiences is not enough how about twice? The pharmacy manager, TS, should not be working with people. The first time my doctor called in for medication and they messed up my name, she yelled at me because she insisted that she didn't have anything for me. I called my doctor and the doctor called her right back. They sorted things out. I got yelled by TS again because of her miscommunication with the doctor, and she took it out on me. Just now again, doctor called the pharmacy early afternoon, but the pharmacy said they had no record of that. TS said she has to check her voice mail. It will be 15 minutes... Fine, I will wait. I was sitting and waiting with my husband half an hour, we asked again. The cashier at the pharmacy told us, it was not on the voice mail as well. Really? You couldn't tell us earlier???? Something else came to my mind --so TS the pharmacy manager doesn't check her voice mail, so I guess if your  doctors have called in, your meds would never be filled and you would be left sick and dying perhaps. She really sucks because she has no sense of urgency and zero professionalism. On top of that she has no people skill and she should not be working with people.

Never use this pharmacy!!!!",0.0
"My boyfriend had surprised me with this tour for my birthday and to be honest I didn't think it was going to be so great. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was completely wrong. Not only did we stop by some of the BEST spots, Mallory, our guide was absolutely incredible. We was funny, sweet, warm, everything you really want in a tour guide of any kind. I live in NY but I would never think to go on one of these. I even thought I'd get sick of the sweets. She went in and always got us the samples and asked if anyone wanted extra and was sure to involve everyone in conversations. It was a nice surprise that we stopped by what is now my FAVORITE Gelato spot in all of the northeastern part of the U.S. Amorino's! They have seasonal gelatos and I go there a lot more often than I'd like to admit. All the spots were great, the samples were amazing, the customer service was incredible. The only place I've never been a fan of is Melissa's cupcakes. Sure, it's cute and tiny, but with all the other stops within a 5 minute walk from there, you can get so much more. Again, if you guys are planning on going on a tour, I highly recommend asking for Mallory! Holy Sweet Tooth, I think I'll walk over to Amorino's and then Molly's!",0.0
"While we had initially enjoyed our meal tonite, we were left with a sick feeling in our stomachs because of the poor treatment we received from the staff and management. The waiter completely forgot an appetizer we ordered. He didn't bring it with the main dishes either and then said he forgot. He had to rush to order it from the kitchen after our main courses were served. He didn't apologize for this mistake. We were ignored during most of the evening. When we received our bill, the management had not ""comp'd"" us or offered any adjustment for the forgotten appetizer. When I brought this up with the waiter and asked them to adjust the bill for their mistake, it became a long back and forth with the waiter and management. No one apologized for the error. They offered to give us a glass of wine for the mistake, but the meal had long ended and by then we just wanted to leave. Then the waiter came over and asked me if I had told the manager that he never brought the missing appetizer. After about 15 minutes, they took the appetizer off the check. Most restaurants want their customers to leave happy and would have quickly removed the item and not given the customer the third degree about their mistake. I won't be returning here. This place needs a course in customer service.",0.0
"I heard of this place by purchasing a Groupon deal for $17 for $30 worth of food and drink. It's very close to Macys. The restaurant just opened this summer, so I'm sure they're working out some kinks. The overall experience was satisfying, as I have been in the mood for ramen for a few weeks. I don't think this is the most authentic Japanese ramen experience but the meal was filling. I ordered the Tonkotsu ($12) with two pieces of pork, half an egg, mushrooms, corn, cabbage and ramen noodles. There was something about the noodles that I didn't like - they were too thin or something (reminded me of Chinese noodle soup). The presentation was pretty good - it looks simple and fresh and I didn't feel sick or filled with salt/msg afterward. The seafood ramen ($16) was ok but the shrimp wasn't peeled and there was sand in the clams. My hand hurt a little after using the chopsticks, probably because they were slippery; they were nice looking though. We also ordered the octopus balls ($6) and they were HOT inside. They had small pieces of octopus inside with the filling and were fried outside. Pretty good. The service was adequate. The restaurant was very loud, even though it wasn't filled to the brim...something about the acoustics in the room. Finishing the wood in the restaurant would have made the restaurant look nicer. I would also ditch the TV. I might return, but it's not a necessity anytime soon, especially with all the good ramen places in the city. The price was also fine by NYC standards.",0.0
"This is an updated review. We've been visiting here for years and sadly it has gotten worse and worse. I once had this place close to 4.5 stars for the food and previous service experience, but this may be our last visit after probably dozens of trips each year. Average spend is nearly $200 when we visit. Our latest escapade: Sushi has gotten worse, very fishy compared to the previously fresh offerings. Some of the Teriyaki Steak and some chicken dishes taste like unseasoned raw meat. I even came back for one more visit after becoming sick after my last visit...i didn't want to give up just yet.....Short ribs and crab were still good, probably because they rotate through the menu a bit faster. Service has also gotten worse. My wife, who broke her leg, came in with her coworkers for a celebration. The restaurant was not as busy as we had previously seen on a Saturday lunch visit. Immediately after we signed the check the waiter asked us to leave since he wanted to sit another table....even though there were several empty tables and only 2 people waiting at the door. We thought he was joking but he rushed my wife out of her seat, crutches and all. From the food to the service, I cannot support this place any longer with spending easily a few thousand dollars a year on visits and events. Very sad as this used to be my wife's favorite restaurant to bring friends and family when they are in town. We'll be taking our business elsewhere.",0.0
"Terrible breakfast. I ordered two eggs over medium, with home fries, wheat toast, and turkey sausage. This combination also came with coffee and orange juice.

-Eggs: came back over easy, unseasoned, but I wasn't upset about that. I usually bat .100 when I order eggs over medium anyway. 
-Home fries: dreadful. Over cooked, bland, mush. Table salt couldn't even improve it. Had about two bites and couldn't eat any more. I looked back in the kitchen before I left and saw about 8-10 lbs of the home fries just sitting just off the brittle waiting to be reheated. Terrible. 
-Toast: wasn't even toasted. holy crap, how do you not toast toast? also store bought, probably made by wonderbread, not freshly made from a bakery.
-Turkey sausage: pretty sure it was pork. Cold in the center. Disgusting. I hope I don't get sick. 
-OJ: from concentrate. They give you a 4oz cup of it. Terrible. 
-Coffee: bitter, very bland. Rather have maxwell house.

I left with more than half of my plate untouched. Waiter didn't think to ask if everything was okay with my meal. 

There are better places for breakfast in the nearby vicinity.",0.0
"By far the worse NYC eats. To be so close to the theater district and be so awful is a shame. 
First the service. At its lowest low when the waiters respond with ""huh""  when they are called. Disrespectful and unprofessional. 
The atmosphere... Disgusting if not horrid. You better be ready to hold your coat on your lap because no one will offer a coat check and when you ask for one they look at you like your the crazy one. The tables are squeezed up next to each other and you may find yourself sitting next to the refill station for dinner. 
Now the food.  We ordered the skirt stake which was to be served with mashed potatoes and a brown mushroom sauce. The stake was dry and Chewey I would have been better off eating my boot. The mashed potatoes,  made from a premix box you can find at path mark and not to leave out the mushroom sauce. With stake you would expect fresh mushrooms but ohhhh no canned mushrooms are good enough for the Brazilian Grill and they are happy to stick a $30.00 price on it.  
We had the garden salad as a start and it was just talked out of a spring mix box and into the plate. Nothing more to that.  So if you are happy paying $12 for just mixed greens with nothing else then please try this place but if you want a descent meal ask for everything else but the kitchen sick to prepare your own meal at the tables. 
Being so disappointed with our dinner we asked to speak to a manager to adress some of the issues we experienced at his restaurant.  When he came to our table not only was he rude but he didn't give a S#! T about what I was saying so instead he cut us off and said Okay i will take out the tip ( which was already included in our bill for a party of 2) yeap.... Be sure to read your bill carefully!!!!  
He then dismissed us and let another waiter handel it.  
If this is what the Brazilian culture and food is like I must say I am so disappointed and this place should be ashamed to call themselves a BRAZILIAN grill. 
Chipotle is a far better choice if you find yourself on 46fh and 8th",0.0
"Mediocre food & far less than poor service.  Ive had the steak salad (bit too much salt but otherwise decent), and various selections of the pizza.  While the pizza was tasty and a solid 8 or 9, we asked for light cheese (my friend cant handle too much lactose-curse of intolerance) but they poured cheese all over it.  It was odd because weve been here a few times before and the pizza was always just right when we asked before hand.  Nbd but when we had to send it back because she would have been sick, the waiter was RUDE AS HELL.  We explained the reason & said sorry about 5 times yet he grabbed the dish off the table and walked away.  Didnt see him for at least half an hour and we were contemplating walking out.  He shows up with a new dish and plopped it (not placed or handed with any sort of ease) on the table - just dropped it like couldnt be bothered - no words or interaction.  Awkward and not acceptable.  I've worked in restaurants, diners and delis-this kind of attitude would never fly in any of them yet this is dining location is in Battery Park where major financial institutions are located and residential real estate is high end.  You would think that they would exhibit exceptional service for the type of clientele that is expected to frequent. 

We sat for another hour like idiots waiting for water or for another round of beer which we had to raise our hands for like we were in second grade.  

However, when the check was dropped,  the waiter came by our table every 10 minutes like clockwork.  Just extremely rude and unprofessional, a horrible experience all around.  Any time we wanted anything we had to awkwardly stare down the staff because they all avoided us and whenever we received anything, it felt like it was being thrown at us.  No matter how beautiful the view or how good the food, i would never come back just so that i'd never have the face the risk of having this waiter again.  Truly don't think ive ever been so disappointed with any restaurant as i have upon my last visit here.",0.0
"A friend was in town for a concert at Bowery Ballroom, and she parked near Little Italy. We cruised from restaurant to restaurant based on Yelp reviews, but all of the three and four star spots posted pasta prices that were a little more than I was looking to spend that night. Finally, I was sick of looking at my phone. We spotted this place and the prices for pasta were under $20 a plate. The man outside pimping the menu offered us a free glass of wine. We were sold. We were seated, we ordered, I checked in on the Yelp app, then I saw the Yelp reviews for this place.

Now, I hang my head in shame. NEVER. AGAIN.

Like I said, we were drawn in by decent prices, an expansive menu, a rustic and cute decor, and said free wine. Our waiter was nice and charming, speaking predominately in Italian. Admittedly, it was a bit swoon-worthy. We ordered an appetizer and two pasta dishes. The mozzarella with bread was almost like a deep-fried grilled cheese sandwich with a piping hot marinara sauce that caused us both to burn our tongues. The focaccia bread was a bit dry; the olive oil glasses were like the glasses Chinese restaurants serve soy sauce in, so the oil dripped onto our bread and plates in a very slow and small stream. The Parmesan cheese shakers weren't much better. 

We got our meals; my friend ordered pasta in a ragu sauce, and I opted for the gnocchi with Gorgonzola. Mine tasted great...until I looked down and saw a piece of gnocchi with hair sticking out of it. I mean, it just wasn't in the sauce or on the gnocchi. The hair was inside of the gnocchi, sticking out in two different places.

I actually gagged as I wrote that preceding sentence. I also gagged at the table and spit the food into a napkin, much to my friend's amusement, and later to mine once I got over the trauma of that incident. 

Service was bad. Straight up. I hate saying that, but I'm merely speaking a truth here. Our waiter kept walking outside to talk to the guy pimping the menu. He'd go behind a partition. He'd pop over to another table. Between the time we finished our meals and finally paid the bill, it was 30 minutes. We had a show to get to at 9 p.m. and were cutting it rather close. We tried getting his attention on many occasions, but, conveniently, his eye line never met ours. Mind you, there are roughly two dozen tables in that establishment, and only five had customers by the time we left. This place was empty. At one point, we were given two more free glasses of wine instead of a check. 

We could not get out of there fast enough as soon as we signed the credit card receipt.

Also, AUTOMATIC ADDED GRATUITY! UGH. After a dining experience like ours, that was kind of the last straw.

I feel I failed both my friend and myself by ending up here. I should have kept checking Yelp reviews on my app instead of putting my phone away. CURSES! Who says you can't be on social media too much? It would have led us to much better options. I apologized to my friend profusely and promised her a better meal at a well-rated restaurant the next time she's in town. Ha!",0.0

If I could give zero instead of one I would. RUDE !!! Horrible people-nasty food and they lie!!!!  I had take out last night spent $60.00 and sclepped the whole thing home myself on a blustery night ... I had specifically asked for the broth of my chicken soup be on the side ... And of course once home everything had been thrown in this dark broth ( tasted like beef and duck broth) I'm sick and just needed chicken broth.  I called them immediately thinking they would swap it out for what I very specifically order ... To my surprise they said it was NOT possible to give me just broth!!! And they hung up on me!!!'  The rest of the food was pretty terrible.,0.0
"I totally agree with the other poster's comments, ""The tension between the people who work there is so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Maybe business is not going well.   Everyone who worked there seemed compressed and guarded - like they had just been screaming at each other until the door opened.""

I have been here a few times and it is awkward, awkward, and more awkward. I wonder if the staff isn't treated well...maybe the manager is a screamer. Not sure. 

Anyway, the goods...for food they claim is fresh everyday, I have definitely had a few not-so-fresh items (cupcake, slice of cake, cookie). The cupcake was not tender (almost stale) and icing was sickeningly sweet. I've also had a few gritty cookies. I really think they could have tested their recipes better and improved them. The muffins don't look appetizing sitting on the white plates they use....too dark and dry looking. 

I wonder if the ovens and such are just props, because never do I see or smell baking items and I've overheard someone say everything is baked uptown. There is a stack of cake boxes on a shelf that looks ready to go and yet never seems to be touched. The one or two baked items on a large white plate look lonely and forgotten. The heart is missing from Pip's Place. I would not recommend it to a friend or serve their food to company. 

I think I've spent enough here and, as much as I'd like to support a local GF bakery, the food & experience just isn't worth it.",0.0
"Okay, this place is mostly getting stars only because: 
Most of the bartenders and the waitresses are friendly. 
The view is spectacular. 

These were the saving graces seriously.

Cons:
It is costly, more so than most other places.  I spent about $150 on alcohol alone for 3 people. 
We arrived on a Saturday and you cannot get food/waitress service in the bar/outside area, you have to sit in the restaurant if you want to eat. 
When we did get food, my boyfriend paid a lot for a burger that was practically McDonald's level.
There is little to no parking in the neighborhood so you have to valet at $20 (cash only and you pay when you come in, you cannot wait until afterwards so have that on hand). 
They begin allowing hookahs at a certain point and let me say, there was a blueberry smelling one that smelled way too sweet. Sickeningly sweet. I almost threw up right then and there. 
As nice as the waiters and bartenders are, they were all not communicating. I had opened a tab at the bar. Then when waitress service began, I wanted to close my tab (because the only way to get a cake for my friend on my credit card was to close the tab). The bartender kept telling me to tell the waitress to just come over and give them my name and they'll split the tip. This was weird and the waitress got upset. I eventually just paid her cash. It was easier than dealing with the drama. 
The clientele's attire is a bit of an eyesore. I'll just leave it at that. 

It was definitely nice for the view but I don't know if I'll rush to return.",0.0
"On any given evening or brunch time, you'll see a large crowd hovering outside of Ruby's waiting for a table. For that reason it's not a go-to of mine even though it's right in my 'hood... because when I'm hungry I wait for no man. 

But if anyone has senior citizen tendencies like me, I highly recommend dropping in for an early brunch (really a breakfast) or an early bird dinner, because this place is tops. I loved the breakfast bowl, which came with poached eggs, greens, avocado, and tomato... and if you're feeling frisky go ahead and order the salmon to put on top! It's a wonderful pile of healthy, delicious food, and a nice departure from the over the top fatty or sickly sweet brunch dishes that I've gotten used to by now. 

As for the space, it's newly remodeled and very cute, but as you could probably tell by the crowds outside, pretty small. I love when it's a warm day and they open their huge windows so it feels like you're dining al fresco. A wonderful spot to visit if you (1) enjoy hanging around on the street or (2) are smart enough to come at off-peak hours.",0.0
"If you're looking to carb-load with literally the change in your pocket, then Golden Steamer is definitely for you. It's a small little hole-in-the-wall kind of place, with containers of steam buns to-go lining the walls.

Take a few steps to the counter in the back, and get a few piping hot steamed buns to nom on the spot. The pork bun has great flavor, but is very fatty- literally chunks of pork fat mixed in with the meat.

Like everyone else says, the real star of the show is the pumpkin bun. It's not sickeningly sweet like most pumpkin treats these days; and it actually tastes like pumpkin, rather than a Yankee candle.

And dude, it costs under a dollar- get 2!

Super soft bread, quick service, and delicious treats. No place to sit, but I don't think your bun will make it past the door uneaten anyways.",0.0
"My DH and I used to try new restaurants all the time, but with two kids who go to bed early and really should not have others subjected to them after 6:00, we were sick of the meals that we had been eating. 

 A friend told me that she and her husband had been using Blue Apron and really enjoyed it.  I gave it a shot.  It is like a cooking class in a box.  It also introduces ingredients that my picky spouse would never eat if I suggested them.  I like the quantity of vegetables that come with the recipes.  I do not love to cook, but I love learning and trying new things, and this was great for that. The food is restaurant yummy.  I also find that the 2 servings is really 3.  It is not quick, but it is worth the time.  

We go to the mountains for the weekends frequently, sometimes with friends, sometimes not, and this is perfect for that.  No major grocery shopping, just take your box, go for the weekend, throw in some easy breakfast food, and your done.  I can't wait to have a girls weekend and bring a box.  It would be perfect for that and fun to make with friends.

It is cheaper than take out and a lot healthier (that is more important).  You also learn new techniques and ingredients you can use to come up with your own meals.  I find I spend a significant amount less on groceries the weeks I use them, since the other days we have simple meals, but still feel satisfied because these are very good.",0.0
"The people that have commented about it tasting like cardboard probably do not eat a healthy lifestyle or have ever been on diet. You come into the place knowing it's a healthy donut option yet you compare it to fat delicious filled donuts like dough or doughnut plant. This is not something you compare since it is a class of it's own. We live in an obese world, so having healthier options for people that can't go cold turkey is a good thing. Done with my rant about the haters.

This place is great. I like to to treat myself every once and a while to something sweet. This hits the spot without making me feel disgustingly sick. Plus some of the donut options are 179-189 calories, which is the range of calories a snack should be in. Am I saying replace all your snacks with these? No, but for a great treat every once and a while - heck yes!

I've had the coconut cream pie, which is amazing. The filled donuts are on point. The dough is def reminiscent of a pillsbury product, which isn't a bad thing since it's what they use. The cinnamon roll middles are also maybe the star of the show. At only 155 calories, these are melt in your mouth good. Finally I have had the cinnamon strudel which tastes like French toast in a donut. I'm happy to recommend this place for clients taking small steps to living a healthier life.

Baked not fried! I like how each donut is made in front of you. It means that is is fresh and made especially for you. Keep up the good work.

"The spaghetti vongole is quite good here, although the portion is small (even for NY) for $15. Nonetheless, my noodles were perfectly al dente, and the wine garlic sauce was very flavorful. I had a decent number of clams, all nicely opened, and the seasoning was on point. Staff was very friendly and kind, and the location is really great for anyone who's sick of the Javits Center region's extremely lackluster food options. The only caveat is that their kitchen doesn't handle rush time well; my dish took close to 20 minutes to arrive, and the woman next to me had to wait 30 minutes for her pizza over a short lunch break - she had to leave half of it because she couldn't finish in the 5 minutes she had left to get back to the office.

"I'm really sad to write this review, because I love the cocktails and the bartenders are really sweet. I've been a regular here for a while and I noticed something one night I was hoping just was a fluke, but I went back again and saw the same thing again. 

While I was sitting at the bar( you see everything if you're paying attention) I noticed the bar back picking up dirty glasses from the tops with his fingers inside all of the glasses, He then moves on to stocking the CLEAN glasses with his hands that he did NOT wash immediately after putting his fingers inside all the DIRTY ones. 

I was so grossed out, I honestly am not sure I would go back here unless they fix this. It's too much of a risk getting sick or catching god knows what. It's a simple fix. This bar back person need to be spoken to. I hope they get this sorted.

"I came here with a bunch of my girls on a Wednesday night. Unfortunately, I was just recovering from being sick and was advised against eating raw fish, that said,  I can't give a more accurate opinion on this establishment. But I did order many cooked food dishes and I was completely dissatisfied.  Shrimp Shumai Is one of my favorite appetizers, It came out fried which was disappointing, steamed is always best and the sauce to accompany it was not right. General Tao ' s chicken, had some red sweet sauce on it, inedible.   The edemame was good and spring roll was decent. Short ribs we actually returned. I never have done that before. 
  The girls ordered lots of sushi said it was ok but nothing that great. The presentation however, looked nice and the service was good.

I went with the hearty turkey sandwich, which features guacamole and swiss cheese on ciabatta. I thought all of the ingredients were nice and fresh, though I wasn't a huge fan of the guac... a little too thin for my taste, I think. I also realized after I had purchased my food that they were supposed to give me a free dessert with my sandwich (there was a tiny sign on the bakery case), but at that point it was too late and I missed out, which I now regret because I love Balthazar baked goods and it would have been a wonderful finish to this pleasant meal.

"I stopped in to get a salad to go during my lunch break. First of all, I have to say it's one of the cuter vegetarian/vegan restaurants I've been to in the city (and I've been to most of them). It's very West Village, if that makes sense. I'm sure this place will be Instagram heaven for foodies (actually, I'm sure it already is!). 

I was in the mood for tempeh, so I went with the Spicy Thai salad. So delicious! Very generous portion of apricot-sriracha tempeh, quinoa, edamame, and wonton strips over romaine and kale. The peanut dressing was thankfully not too heavy and well balanced with lime juice. Very filling salad but it won't leave you feeling sick like a regular Thai meal. Price came out to roughly $12 with tax, but I'd say that's the average price for a salad in the city (and the quality here is great). 

Overall, I was very impressed. Definitely exceeded my expectations for a ""to go"" lunch salad. I'd much rather eat this salad than something from Sweetgreen (which is also very good!). Definitely want to come back to explore the menu.  The taco salad looked great and I'm also curious about the vegan macaroni and cheese, which is made with a sweet potato base.",0.0
"What can I say about city sandwich.

Lets see, well when I lived in Hell's Kitchen a couple of years ago I remember saying to myself, there's really not a great, affordable little place where you can get a great tasting lunch around here. 

There are a ton of restaurants in Hell's Kitchen but when you have tried everything in your neighborhood and was never blown away, and you're sick of spending too much money on eating out, you resort to having to cook. 

I remember when they first opened I was thinking hmm sounds interesting let me try it. That was it, I fell in love!! 

My sister and I were greeted by the owner chef Michael Gruerrieri , who was so nice and warm and right away gave us free samples of his delicious sandwiches. 

I literary ate lunch there every day until I moved. I wouldn't even know what sandwich to suggest, they pretty much have a sandwich for everybody. Whether you're a meat lover (the Todd was my favorite meat sandwich) a breakfast lover or a vegan/vegetarian (the Dianne is my favorite vegetarian sandwich) you will be satisfied. 

They use the freshest vegetables and most amazing bread ever. 

Also their panna cotta, is THE BEST PANNA COTTA IN NYC HANDS DOWN!!

"Mee Noodle is not fancy. They are a corner restaurant contained in all of about 150 square feet if I'm being generous, but if you want good quality, no frills Chinese food, this is your joint. It's an old-style traditional Chinese restaurant where you can see the cooks hustling while you check out what everyone else is eating. 

You can stop by any time of day and they will always be busy. Not too busy for you, but busy enough that you know people keep coming back. I've been coming here for years. (Actually, I do mostly delivery but when I've eaten in-house they have been quick and delicious.)

When I've ordered for delivery? They are almost at my door by the time I hang up the phone. For real. They're ridiculously fast.

My go-to is the Tofu with Broccoli in garlic sauce. Their brown sauce is probably the best in the city. The Dried Sauteed String beans are also a not-to-be-missed dish and when in mixed company we usually get the Sweet & Sour chicken,  General Tso's or Chicken with Broccoli. All are crowd-pleasers. 

Hot Tip: If you are ever feeling sick, the hot and sour soup is the way to go. Throw in some of their spicy mustard and it's a cure-all. You're welcome. 

The prices are totally reasonable, in fact, they charge less for main dishes than many in the neighborhood and they have great lunch specials to boot.

   Also the address claims they r on e 87 so I constantly see people trying to go in on 87 and employees constantly yelling at them to go to the entrance on 88 . Well if u don't   want ppl to go in on 87 don't advertise that you're located on 87 to try to make it seem like you're closer to the subway when you're not. or make your store more convenient and let people go in and out of either entrance.",0.0

The place gets 2 stars mainly for the feel and decent waiters.

Where to start about how unimpressed I was? First, the menu needs some tweaking to get it into the ""tavern feel"". They need to really zone in the kind of cuisine they want to serve not all of the above like I saw: Tex-Mexican, Traditional-American, Southern Comfort Food, etc.  

I had a chicken sandwich and it lacked seasoning. The way the sandwich was organized, it wasn't layered properly. Usually when you bite into a good sandwich, each time you get a bite of the meat, lettuce, tomato and sauce. This was completely just off. 

My mother had the fried chicken with mash potatoes...this was an epic fail. The chicken came out RAW. The meat was clearly pink and needed a few more to cook. Raw chicken carries Salmonella which can get a person very sick for days. I informed the waiter about this and they took the plate away to do something. The next round that came out, was extremely over cooked and the batter was under seasoned. Someone needs to go into that kitchen and give the chef a bottle of Lawry salt and a thermometer to get that chicken right!  The Chinese take out place across the street from there makes better chicken and it's half the price for x2 the quantity. 

I was a little irked that they didn't even offer a complimentary drink for serving my mother RAW chicken but hey, there needs to be improvement to the staff in customer service.

Hopefully, they have some major improvements in the quality of food because this place will not be in business for long.",0.0
"We just left, and quite honestly don't know what to say about the service.  Let's premise this with the fact we were not in NYC this previous weekend. We were treated with such rudeness from the waitress and quite didn't understand what we did wrong but chalked it up to her not having a good night.  We ordered a bite & drinks and that was the last of the waitress we saw. The food tasted really bad and quite honesty not how we remembered it when we were there last year.  On our way out the manager states ""where you hear before?"" And naturally we say yes. ""Our staff said you were really rude and arrogant last week you were here.""  Whereby we each stated ""I wasn't hear last week, I was in Vegas, and I was in Chicago, and I was on call at the hospital"".....whereby he responded with ""our waitress is 100% its you that treated her bad and your no longer welcome here.""  What do you say to that? Other than ""it wasn't us!""  I promptly told him ""there is a chance and although very small in your head that it's not us, but the fact you think it's okay to speak to someone like that is mind boggling"". 

Honestly never left a place of business with that kind of mistreatment. Maybe look on your transactions and see if we came before. Worst is we don't know if they spit or tossed in something to make us sick. Honestly what does anyone say or do after we left?",0.0
"A great cozy warm place, especially when it is raining or snowing outside.  Very convenient to the theaters and very reasonably priced. The atmosphere brings out the customers friendly side.  

The best French Onion soup I have ever tasted.  The menu is a great selection of Irish food, however; the food must not always be prepared by the same chef.  Sometimes the food is cooked to perfection and other times it's uneven and just not quite right.  Ex:  the tuna sandwich is usually one if my favorites that I like medium rare.  However last week it was rare in the middle and burnt on the outside.  Probably cooked under too high of heat. 

The hostess is cute ass hell, but isn't very friendly.  Everyone else is great and they are a true Irish crew.  

Unfortunately there are a lot of bad Irish Pubs in NYC (JP Moran's, I still get sick even thinking about that place), however; O'brien's will not disappoint.",0.0
"I love this bar - great ambience, awesome staff and great drinks but when I ate there for the first time a couple of days ago I was thoroughly disappointed. We asked the waitress for recommendations and she said their signature dishes were the polenta and broccoli rabe so we ordered both, we also got a half portion of cabanara and the meat balls. Well the polenta was ok on the first bite but it soon became sicklily with all the cheese and oil and we couldn't finish it. The broccoli rabe arrived and seemed to taste just like the polenta - covered in a sickly cheesy sauce that was heavy, fatty and had huge clumps of salty cheese in it. The meatballs were meh and the cabanara was the worst i've ever tasted. It came with a poached/raw egg on top which was neat but when we mixed that into the pasta, all we could taste was egg yolk and the whole dish was luke warm. No subtlety of flavors to be found in any of their dishes, no complimentary flavors like sweet, salty, spicy...everything was bland and masked by a cheesy sauce. I haven't given up on this place as there are still lots of other many items and i love the staff, but wasn't impressed with our dinner that set us back $90.",0.0

Anyway by accident I found this place and wow a smile and hello when I walked through the door...wow. The cakes are just as good as cakeman if not better. The caramel is yummy!

"So I work in the neighborhood. There's only so many places you can go on your lunch break before you get sick of them. I decided to finally come here and try something (plus I was craving a smoothie horribly). I ordered the juice Cobb salad and created my own smoothie. Was it pricey? Oh gosh, yes.

"walked in, asked if artichoke and spinach empanada had cheese. Gotta give it to her, she was very nice, but she had no idea. Instead of finding out the answer, she said ""I don't think so."" Then looked at me, waiting for my order. Now, I get severely sick if I ingest cheese. So, I needed her to know. I asked if she could find out, she went in the back and came back with news that, in fact, there IS cheese. Ordered $4 oatmeal instead. As if a handful of grains should cost $4.
Went to bathroom. Was around sick children and holding subway poles so in addition to needing to tinkle, really needed clean hands. Opened door and was greeted with my predecessor's...um, leftover smell. Tinkled, went to finally wash hands, and no soap. Like, none. Dammit!!!! Went to dry unclean hands and dryer was broken. WTF? No paper towels? No. Left bathroom wet and covered in germs to drink my subpar tea.
Told young man at counter about bathroom. His response: yeah, well there's stuff to wipe your hands at the bar.

That would be napkins he was referring to.

(Tried that, btw, and there were NO NAPKINS.)

I was working so I was gonna go show them after work, but they were closed. So I was eh whatever.  Today, I ordered tossed salad from them with some grapes and blueberries.  I never tasted spoiled grapes and it made me almost throw up.  I'm again working now and got no time to bring it to them and waste my energy to tell them it is the right thing to keep fruits fresh for salad.

And the food?  The food is amazing!  The stuffed cabbage is some of the best I've ever eaten.  The Israeli Cous Cous is well seasoned and plentiful, and the sauces of every dish were rich and delicious.

Edited for the tea.  I was getting sick when I arrived so I ordered the tea and I noticed you could get tea ""with preserves.""  I had never heard of this and wasn't sure what it was, so I ordered it.   With my tea came a fruit cocktail glass bowl of cherry jam to add to your tea.

"Remember when you were a kid and sometimes you tasted something you'd never tasted before? Like the first time you ate a pickle? It was like a whole brand new thing and you had nothing to compare it to and you just had to decide on the spot, Do You Like This Thing?

You don't get that feeling anymore. Now it's all stuff you've already eaten. Oh yeah, you say: beets, I don't like those. Dragon fruit, well, this is just a weird kiwi.

But the minted peas at Willow were a brand new thing for me. All fermented and umami with aerated yogurt and cured egg yolk and my mouth was like what the fuck is this, man, I'm not even sure this is food yet, but then it decided that it was and that these are the best peas I've ever had in my life. Which, I mean, I know, you're not in the habit of thinking very much about peas - but someone at Willow put some thought into them, and here they are. I appreciate these peas.

This place is by the Pines team - that's a restaurant in Gowanus on 3rd, you should check it out, it's awesome - and it shares their inventive feel. (They're also related in some way I don't totally understand to the Littleneck people - that's on the same block as The Pines - they all feel related, anyway. And they're all amazing.) 

So their pierogis were great, mostly for the morels, which were sick; the hake was just an excuse for an insane lobster sauce, but it was a good excuse; soft shell crab was terrific. There were no misses here. 

Hey, while we're chatting, how are you on this whole ""trees in your food"" thing? I don't think it's specific to the Pines family, though I've seen it at all three places - here there was pine extract or something in my brilliant cocktail, and they gave us a spruce meringue with the check. I've seen spruce in a pie at Four & Twenty Blackbirds too, and Oiji is doing pine-smoked mackerel, so I think trees are officially A Thing at this point. I'm cool with it? I mean, it's different.

You can only get mimosas, bellinis and bloody maries and I felt kind of sick by the time our food came. The food was bland and I only finished about half of it. I do like the setup and I think it's cool sitting outside on the street so I can give it 3 stars because of that.",0.0
"Probably the worse pizza experience I've had in my life. 

I am very liberal with my low star reviews, and I feel the only star this review deserves is for our waitress.

I came with the BF while near the Chelsea area craving pizza. Originally, I had wanted to get Lombardi's, but BF insisted Artichokes was really good and wanted to try this location. We went in and saw that there was table service, which was great. We honestly should have gotten a self service seat in the back. 

Our waitress got us water and forgot about our ginger ale until reminding her later. We ordered the sampler which looked like a pretty good deal to try different slices, but it is basically 3 slices of reheated $5 pizza for $17. We also ordered the stuffed artichoke appetizer.

It was not a full house and not very busy, but we did not expect all to wait nearly 30 minutes for the artichoke. When it came, we were starving and it was burned beyond recognition. I wish I had a gotten a picture but it was charred like there was no tomorrow. We attempted to eat it and it was extremely salty and unchewable. There was no way we could even eat it. We told our waitress and she attempted to explain that you were supposed to chew the tips and not really eat it, but how can you even chew burned rubber? We returned it to the kitchen, which the waitress hesitated trying to explain that this is how it is usually. She offered to replace it with another appetizer and we picked garlic sticks, which we never even saw the light of at our table. 

I highly believe that if you serve a dish your restaurant is named after, it better at least be edible.

We waited another 10 minutes for pizza. Waiting 30 minutes for slices of pizza? This better be fresher than Will Smith in Bel Air. We ordered Sicilian, artichoke and white. The first one we tried was the Sicilian which was disgusting. Again the crust and bottom was charred and burned black! There was way too much tomato sauce that was extreme sweet and soggy that it was all you tasted. The basil was burned so badly that we didn't realize it. Is this even pizza?

The artichoke was the house specialty. I had high expectations for this since it was the famous slice the place is named after. It was the only slice that didn't have a burned crust. The artichoke dip as a topping concept was nasty. It was not cheesy and feels like someone had taken a half warm artichoke soup and put it on pizza. Yes it was like having one of those soupy bread bowls from Pizza Hut. Talk about major fail. Imagine eating this with your hands, it would probably spill all over the place. The consistency? Undercooked egg white swimming around spinach with non existent artichoke and cheese or flavor. It just tasted heavy and nasty. I felt sick to my stomach and couldn't even eat this so called ""pizza."" I would highly rename this watery artichoke soup on bread. 

The white was the only edible one. It was very dry, a sign that it's been sitting for a long time and put in the for oven too long. There was not enough ricotta and it was in desperate need of some oil and herbs and flavor. The bottom of the crust was also burned and I could not eat it and only scrapped off the top. This really made me think about the terrible consistency this place has. How were two pizzas burned and one still watery? I was extremely disappointed, especially with the hype surrounding the place. My expectations for Italian food are very high because the flavors are so simple yet the key is to use fresh ingredients and use the right techniques to make it the right way. Artichoke was a huge let down. 

The waitress was so embarrassed of the kitchen she did not even dare check on on us because she knew the pizza was disgusting. She did however take off the nasty burned stuffed artichoke from our check and I pray no one will ever order it. 

Whoever calls this good pizza probably has never had a slice of 99 cent Two Bros, which is astronomically better than Artichokes. I will never come back to this location. So over priced to pay 17 dollars for 2 slices and a square of ""pizza."" Save yourself $16 dollars and I will be glad you did when you like your $1 pizza more.",0.0

"This place is a dump.  While they are renovating they are trying to conduct business as usual.  Later at night they have workman sheet rocking and plastering right over your food, with minimal protection to the food stuff.  Last night a man was plastering a wall directly over the bakery items with barely a sheet of plastic covering the food items.  In another aisle, the entire floor was being drilled at in an effort to lift off the old tiles.  Dust and other debris was all over the place.  But forget the renovation... This store is always a dirty place.  And while I've been shopping here for years, I'm staring to get real concerned abou the safety of the food in this place.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Marie Calendar's pie for 10.00 and found when I took it home it was a mess - it obviously sat on a hand truck waiting to be unpacked and put in the freezer for quite some time.  I'm concerned about all the pre sliced (in store sliced) meats and cheeses in one of the coolers where the stuff looks like its been sitting a bit to long.  Everything in this store is a dirty mess.

"I am literally typing out this review in the midst of my meal. If you live in Bed Stuy (of course depending upon where.), you'll know that if you're looking for a great place to deliver you some decent grub, you're most likely SOL. Unless you want mediocre Chinese food, Indian food or soul food. One of which I'm very sick of and two of which aren't my style. Anywho, upon finding this place on delivery.com, I was skeptical from some mixed reviews. Months later (today), I decided to use an $8 discount on delivery.com and try this place out while it seemed most convenient. After choosing from the various options on the menu, I went with these items:

Spicy girl roll (Shrimp, spicy crabmeat, avocado, tempura flakes and a cream cheese dip deep fried and topped with 2 chef's special sauces.): Pleasantly surprised. This tastes like so many different things all at once, but the ONE thing that it definitely does taste like, is greatness. It is a little spicy, but definitely nothing a lightweight can't handle. Unless you're a wuss.

Rock shrimp (crispy shrimp in house spicy mayonnaise): I expected this to be good. I thought it would be your typical breaded shrimp with spicy mayo sauce. Sounds good to me. After seeing it for the first time, I questioned that notion. Upon tasting it, I knew I was right. The mixture of the crispy orange coating (don't let that turn you off!), mayo and shrimpy taste couldn't be more awesome. 

I also got vanilla mochi ice cream but I haven't tried that yet. Will update the review once I've had that. But how can you mess up something so simple? We'll see. But for now, the verdict: definitely worth trying.

^^^ And that is why this review sat in my drafts for months by accident. The vanilla mochi was delicious, if you are hesitating whether to get it or not, hesitate no longer! Since this first order, I've also tried the Special Philadelphia Roll. Soooo super delicious. Highly recommended.",0.0

I would've been ok about the error if I liked strawberry cakes but I actually am sick of them and this cake was not delicious enough to change my mind about them... I don't recommend them...

"The menu says Modern Szechuan but apparently there's another name for this address. Oh well but I decided to try this spot as I am sick of deli food and want something that has a bit more flavor to the food. Plenty of seats at the front of the restaurant as well as the back. 

You can do buffet which I believe is $6.99lb or order hot food from the other counter. They only have one size containers for the hot buffet but I tend to consume less and get a little of everything. I don't like to waste food and money so no overflowing in my container. The food was tasty way better than the deli spots by me or around me. 

Definitely will be back!",0.0
"I'm tired of this place already.  The prices have gone up.. twice.  If you go at any given off peak hour they will be out of the most basic ingredient (ie chicken) and I'm sick of that bratty kid climbing the walls when I'm trying to relax after work.  It's true that the tortas and cemitas here are great, but they are great elsewhere in the neighborhood too.

A lot of the flavor is masked by the huge amount of crumbly Mexican cheese they put on everything..  = too salty.

I don't think the four and a half stars they have on Yelp will last much longer.",0.0

"I live directly across the street from this domino's location - literally a 45 second walk.  I asked for delivery because I was with a toddler and didn't want to leave the apartment with her since she was sick.  

Although the tracker said that my order left the store at 1:05pm, my delivery didn't arrive until 2pm.

When I called the location to inquire about my order, they immediately hung up the phone.  Upon calling back, I waited for 30 seconds for someone to answer and then they hung up yet again.  Calling back a third time, had a 30 sec wait and finally someone answered.

Never again will I order from this location.",0.0

"This place has turned over quite a bit in the past 10 years, I suppose that's normal for NY....and in all of it's forms I have still gone to this location.  LOL 

Went for a date night with my gal ... we bought a Groupon.  It was worth it.  The food was good, on a scale of 1-10 it was a 5.  Nothing to write home about but it was NOT bad, I didn't end up sick on the floor, and there was SO MUCH food that we ended up having doggy bags.  So, it's not bad at all.  

The service was good.  The decor is what it is, it's kind of tacky...lol BUT what's terrible is that this place is always a lounge and as a result it always is kind of gross.  It smells gross, the furniture is gross.  The bathroom stalls don't lock. 

So, if I were to go back it would be for a drink ... not food, the idea of eating in a place like this skeeves me lol BUT that was the only downside.  For me, personally, it was a big downside.  I'm sorry. :(",0.0

The atmosphere was fun, I went on a Friday night. They play loud Hip-Hop music, making it a little bit difficult to talk to your friends/date/whatever, but it also makes the place cool. The Chicken Parm and Spaghetti Bolognese were fantastic and though the portions weren't massive, I left feeling content and didn't have that ""I'm sick I ate too much"" feeling. 

Our food came out within five minutes of ordering it, which was kind of surprising, and if my date didn't order wine I would have felt as though they were trying to rush us out -which would have been annoying - but that said, the food and atmosphere were great and worth experiencing...

"We actually came here twice (dinner, then lunch) because we want to try the paella. 
Pretty good paella with good amount of fresh seafood on top; unfortunately, I had better ones before :/ (But I've been to Spain and had paella until I felt sick, so probably wasn't the fair judge)
Ordered the squid ink paella, but I guess because it was black so it was hard to tell, a portion of it were burnt and we couldn't even scrape it off the pan because it was in a coal texture already lol.
The tapas are actually not my cup of tea...not not-good, but didn't stand out at all. 

The restaurant is small with cool decor (drawer doors as ceiling!) and good atmosphere, but I think they are a little bit lack of staffing, so the service wasn't that attentive for the kind of price level this restaurant is--definitely $$$, it is a default at least $25 per person if you order paella.",0.0
"Don't get me wrong, the dumplings are very good. But the wait in such a cramped space is ridiculous. Also, I really didn't appreciate how the worker was clearly sick.

His skin never actually touched my food, and I didn't want to raise a stink with such a long time, but I was definitely grossed out.",0.0
"Anything called a 'large format feast' has my attention, so I was excited to try the pork version with a big group of friends. For $75/person, 8-20 people get to chow down on an ENTIRE PIG over three courses. I'm not sure where the ears and feet ended up in the meal, but I do know that it was some of the tastier pork I've ever had. 

Highlights included the first course, a pig liver mousse and the roasted pork leg with charred brussels sprouts. Unfortunately, by the time the last few dishes came out, we were so stuffed that it was hard to truly appreciate them. It may have been a good thing because the dessert was a pretty disappointing bread pudding. The menu we saw before said we were getting a cobbler, which I love, but it's hard to get a good bread pudding. Though again, I was so full I could barely sit up straight so it didn't really matter what it was. 

Now my complaints, which may have brought this review down to three stars if the food wasn't sooo good:

- They got our reservation number wrong and we didn't have enough space at the big table. They ended up making an awkward L-shape with another table, making it really hard to have conversation. 

- Oh, they never apologized for it. 

- On the menu it makes it sound like the beverage packages ($35 or $65) are optional add-ons, but when I got there I was told that we were all getting the all you can drink package, like it or not. I would have definitely passed on the package if I had the choice as I hate getting all you can drink deals (it's a surefire way to get sick), and besides I had started the night with strong martinis that I would have skipped had I known. 

- Overall, the cost per person ended up being $170.. I assume that's the food, drink package, and gratuity (though I thought that may have been included in the per head cost?) Very pricey, but you do get a LOT of food. We had about half the pig to take home for leftovers, which to me kind of defeated the purpose of having a whole pig feast since so much inevitably went into the trash. 

So if you keep those things in mind and don't mind splurging on a nice dinner with a big group, I think you'll enjoy.",0.0
I placed my order on grub hub at 330 and I received a confirmation with an expected time for 430. The reason I even ordered my food to be delivered was because I was sick and couldn't go out to buy food. I finally get a phone call at 450-thinking they're outside I answer and run to the door only to find out that they didn't have anything I ordered. I didn't even receive an apology or anything. Or even an alternative to what I had ordered. To top it off I was told I'd have to call grub hub to request a refund-which I later found out they could have done for me. I was on the phone for ten minutes until I was finally able to get in touch with someone. Horrible service. This use to be my favorite Peruvian restaurant. No more.,0.0

She wasn't particularly helpful in helping is select beers (oh we don't have blue moon and I can't really say what's close).

"TL;DR 10 ""ok"" dumplings for $2.

With the popularity of extremely delicious ""$1 dumplings"" from Prosperity Dumplings and Vanessa's Dumplings and spawning the high end dumpling market, you sometimes wonder how normal dumplings were supposed to taste like.  Well WONDER NO MORE!!

These dumplings are good...if Prosperity didn't exist 3 blocks away.  I guess this is how ""ok"" dumplings are supposed to taste like.  The dumpling meat was a little more wet and soppy than Prosperity and Vanessa's, which I personally don't like.  The meat becomes mushy before you even bit into it.  I like my dumpling meat (you're sick for thinking that) to have a bit of a resistance as I bite into it.  If i wanted weak meat I would've put it in a blender.

The good part about this place is they do 5 dumplings for a dollar, but only if you buy two dollars worth.  That's a full 25% more than Prosperity!  So if you're a fatty with little cash, China North Dumpling is the place to go.",0.0
This is the second Chinese place I have tried in the heights. The food was great and not too oily but I had the food delivered with a bottle of snapple and the plastic that is usually around the top of the snapple was missing and as I went to open the bottle the cap immediately came off I didn't even do a full turn it was as if the delivery guy had opened the bottle. I found this very unsettling and felt like the guy had spit in it. The bottle cap was already loose when i opened it. My throat itched and started to hurt that night. I'm not sure if it's some kind of sick thing that delivery guys in the heights do and open the bottles and spit in them but I would not order any bottle of snapple from any Chinese place in this area because the cap will always be loose and the plastic seal that usually appears around the cap will be removed. You are better off ordering a can of soda cause they can't open the can and tamper with it.,0.0

"I haven't had barbeque in months after visiting Fette Sau.  We ordered what we thought was only a little, which turned out to be a lot.  Yikes.

We arrived at 12 on a Saturday, which is apparently when they open.  Didn't take long to get our food and find seating inside.

Beef brisket: By far the best of the meats we got.  Juicy, fatty, and flavorful... yum
Pork belly: really dry and tasteless........ surprising
Spicy sausages: meh... that's all I have to say because it wasn't very memorable. 
Baked beans were good but in my opinion had a tad bit too much meat/meat flavor in it.

"I went to the one on 68st (I think) and I loved the experience and food there. I thought this would be the same, but it wasn't.

I ended up not even able to finish the other half it was so bad. And I could tell the girl that took my order was sick of working at this place so I just didn't bother her again.

I would totally go back to the other location but this one, sadly, no more.

Sad to hear that it's closed, but not too surprised as it wasn't too amazing.

I'll give them a very, very generous four stars because they're serving up something that is usually only found in Germany, and they're making a decent effort.

However, neither the Currywurst nor the sauce it was drenched in, really wowed me at all. They didn't remind me of what I had in Germany, nor did I particularly love them. They also weren't bad, and as a late night snack it might really rock your world. So I'll give it a 4.

Went there this past Monday and just had to write a review. I am totally in love with this place! From the second you walk in the space and decor are utterly breath taking. But the real reason i have taken the time to write this before i head out to work is the Grill chef! He is a god on the grill every bite of my burger was like a bite of heaven! I'm so sick of places that can not cook a simple burger! Well this has it down to a T. Me and my friend were sitting right in front of the grill so we got a peek into our food being made. You could visually see the excitement and pride as this cooked. It was cool really like the open kitchen thing. The drinks were great and our server polite and attentive. Over all amazing experience! On my way out I asked the chef for his name and he replied Ron. Hey Pier A. This guy can cook! Keep up the good work Pier A I will be back!,0.0
"This is probably the only place where I can revisit a million times and still not get sick of their food.  Hands down the best ramen I had so far in NY!

"There is something magical about The Australian Every time a friend suggests going there for happy hour I immediately feel excited and can't wait to go! It is one of those places that I could go to over and over again and never get sick of. It is very casual and perfect for happy hour! I miss working nearby because I can't go for lunch or happy hour as often. Also, anyone I have introduced this place to, has also become hooked! 

They have a great happy hour menu Monday through Friday from 4-7 on drinks and also on some appetizer selections. This place is like a diamond in the rough because it's prices are actually reasonable, compared to normal expensive NYC prices. 

I was lucky enough to be in the neighborhood a few months ago, and got to stop in for lunch! It kind of made my week, and now that I am writing my review a few months later, it is making me want to go there very soon again! 

The grilled Kangaroo salad is very unique because it doesn't even contain lettuce. It is very protein packed with the kangaroo and the chickpeas. Definitely not a salad that leaves you hungry 2 hours later. This is one of my go-to entrees at the Australian because it's healthy, hearty, and delicious. I also love that it ties into the Aussie flavors by having kangaroo instead of chicken.

The Aussie nachos are extremely addictive! When I went to the Australian for the first time, my friend introduced me to the Aussie Nachos that can be ordered in a happy hour portion, and I have been hooked since. There is something to be said for adding the ""sweet"" flavor to nachos instead of spicy. The sweet chili sauce really is a hit on this dish, and makes every bite sweet, savory and just that amazing. The mango salsa and guacamole is also very fresh and homemade. This is one of those appetizers that I would order as a meal and not want to share with anyone because I enjoy it that much! 

I highly suggest if you work in the fashion district, that you check this place out. They also have an upstairs area where you can have private parties or gatherings which is nice. On the weekends it is less busy and actually kind of relaxing which is nice, since the fashion district isn't busy on weekends.",0.0

"I've always been a fan of Melt Shop's cheese sandwiches and especially their Parmesan flavored Shop Tots.  Since I was in Downtown Manhattan for a day I made the trek to Fulton Street but was overbearing confronted by a staff who was directly in my face.  The dude is aggressive with his unprofessional sales tactics and no communication skills:  ""You must fill out the survey entirely!!""  The pen was in my hand as I was writing my responses. Ergo, I responded brutally blunt with a blank scowl look: ""can you see I am doing exactly that? I am completing this survey now but you rudely interpreted my thought as I am writing my responses!!"" How do you want your customers to complete the survey you handed out without giving sufficient time to read and respond?? 'Do this now!!'

ANOTHER NYC case of, you're paying for the venue. I'm sick of it. Why is this one of the only places in the world where the good food is often found in low key places, and the nice venues often have horrible food and service. Guess you can't win.

The setting is beautiful, probably the nicest outdoor venue in all of Manhattan. Great views, nice breeze, and the building is awesome.

So where you'll run into major issues.

We went to wait for our table out back, they only serve sliders there, and you can go to the bar or flag down a server, but the servers came up to us after we had drinks to take our next order. We then didn't see our server for a really long time (20 minutes), and then our table was ready, so we had to take our drinks that arrive to our table, which peeved our waiter at the table who then couldn't take our order because we had drinks. Couldn't win here. 

The seafood was mediocre at best. The clams and oysters were the size of quarters, the lobster was near frozen and over cooked, and the shrimp was nothing different than you'd buy prepackaged at a grocery store. Their mussels were okay, the white wine sauce was alright, but most of the mussels had a weird crunchy interior and something ropey in them so I didn't finish the plate. I eat mussels often and haven't had that experience ever so it wasn't me just being grossed out by them

We then were sitting at a table but kept having to go to the bar to get drinks because our waiter went MIA a lot. 

By all means, the wait staff was extremely friendly, they just couldn't be attentive because there wasn't many of them. The food sucked out loud, the whole table of 10 agreed, and most of them were drinking and it was all bar food/small bites so we weren't looking for a Michelin star.

"It might be the least pretentious spot in Meatpacking. Basically anyone - or perhaps literally everyone - can get in. If you don't want to deal with Meatpacking BS, you have found your spot.

I've been here twice - the first time, I loved it; the second time, I wasn't impressed. Note: My level of enjoyment may have been directly correlated with my state of intoxication. My first visit, I was thoroughly convinced that the DJ and I had a soul connection - the music was sick, or maybe I was just hammered? At the very least, he played some decent tracks and nice throwbacks, and I had essentially the entire dance floor to myself. (Didn't mind one bit, and yes, I worked that floor). Second visit, the place was far more crowded, and the music was pretty lame - typical club fare [noise with a crap beat]. Perhaps I just wasn't drunk enough, but the crowd itself was so viscerally... lame.

Now that the hype has died down a bit (and with it the waits), we tried out the bakery on a Saturday afternoon. The space is small inside, with aesthetically pleasing but not really practical stadium seating- kids were using it as a jungle gym when we visited.

And no, there are no cronuts here (as the lady behind me in line couldn't quite understand...really?). We ended up trying:

Chocolate Sea Salt Madeleines (sample in line): these were great warm, but the chocolate inside seemed slightly burnt.

Blueberry Laminated Brioche ($3.75): very delicate and light, with fresh blueberry compote and cream. I found the blueberry mixture to be a bit too sweet for my liking, but my companion really enjoyed it.

Matcha Beignets ($5.50): these were ok, a little oily which the matcha helped cut through. I wish there was a touch of regular powdered sugar though!

Mother's Day Cherry Scone with Rose Jam & Clotted Cream ($4.50): I'm a huge sucker for scones, so as soon as I saw this special, I knew I needed it. The scone was super crumbly, and the jam/cream were perfect complements. This was definitely my favorite treat, and I wish they offered these on a daily basis!

What a slow neglectful service we got for my bf's dad's bday.

On to the food now right?
Their homemade guacamole with crabmeat was just weird and horrible alone with their tuna sashimi thing ugh that sundried tomato paste to it was really awful and reminded me  as if I was eating olives on top of the raw tuna... Just not a great combination, just no. Their calamari was either not fresh but frozen or just overly cooked being the fact it was wayyy too damn chewy and under seasoned !! However, their enchilada was ok but really salty... I actually only enjoyed their paella a lot, the plaintains wrapped on shrimp, and the lamb chops were delicious and not gamey at all! However that's makes it only three tapas out of the 12 we ordered...

So I'm convinced my second time that Staten Island yelpers don't know how to eat.",0.0

"My experiences are based on delivery only.  

Pho has definitely has become my top 5 favorite foods of all time.  It's my go to cure for when I'm sick, hungover, cold, sad, happy, alive - I just want it all the time.  And when I'm craving it, I need it ASAP.  Midtown does not serve your most authentic Pho but Cha Pa's does the job when you need it.  

I'm giving them 5 stars because they are very consistent, reliable and fast.  I have ordered from them more than dozens of times and I know they they will come to my door within 30 minutes with exactly what I'm expecting.

One time, they did forget to add in my bean sprouts, herbs and sauces.  When I called them, they weren't like other delivery places - ""oh we'll give you credit"" ""or ""next time we'll give you extra appetizer"" or huff and puff first, get me what I need.  They were very apologetic and delivered the missing ingredients within 10 minutes.
That's just good service.",0.0
"I live right next to this place and it's DEADLY.  Cupcake wise: The red velvet and banana with creme cheese frosting win hands down. Their yellow daisy cupcakes are solid as are the chocolate ones.  They do a season cupcake like nutella, and pumpkin spice, duce de lece etc.. and they are good just depends on your taste.  The icebox cakes rock. I like when they do strawberry. Also banana pudding and banana creme pie are sick!  it's the home made wip cream that makes it.  It's really a no frills bakery with a great staff and pretty amazing cupcakes.  I'm a cupcake addict. Best of all it's opened late so you can see the Chelsea crowds and NYCers of all differentwalks of like chilling here.",0.0
"Bartender (I think his name was Mike) was an enormous, un-evolved cretin of a man.  I'd call him a Cro-Magnon throwback, but that would be insulting to Cave Men everywhere.  This animal couldn't get through one sentence without an eff-bomb.  I mean one sentence.  I'm not  a prude, but if you were seated at a bar and had to listen to a loud boor uttering the word ""flower"" in every single sentence (often twice in a sentence), you would be sick of the work ""flower"".  Expand your vocabulary, you ridiculous excuse for a human being....

"I don't even know where to start with this poor excuse of a business. Disgusting atmosphere, disgusting food, disgusting customer service. This place is definitely roach and vermin infested--dirt and grime everywhere. The food here is pure garbage in terms of what it's made of--how do we even let that into our bodies?!--and what it tastes like. But the customer service--or lack thereof takes the cake. They are disgusting, horrible, and rude to their customers. Without us, there IS no business. They outright YELLED at us when we were having an issue with a charge they slapped on us without notifying us beforehand, something they are notorious for. We are sick and tired of taking this from them. We have been nothing but patient with them but no longer. We put in a word with the Better Business Bureau and will be taking our Chinese food cravings elsewhere.",0.0
"Mais Oui! Quatre étoiles! 

The only reason I could not give this place 5 stars it is because:
-size of my mussels
-the fact that I was sure that the owner was sitting in the table next to us and I did not see him working the patio in terms of greeting his guests and asking them if they were enjoying themselves. That type of thing is important and at these prices, it adds a nice touch. There was no way this guy wasn't the owner with his big Frenchie type glasses and all of the Frenchy sounding stuff coming out of his mouth.
- not enough of a per glass sparkling section

The tuna tartar appetizer was out of this world but I'm not quite sure why I came with fries but ate them anyway. They we're delish.

The beautiful wine sauce for the mussels was sick and wrong (that's good) and came with fries again...hmmmm..maybe it's the French way? I would have appreciated them realizing i ordered two things that came with fries and maybe they could have substituted something else..just a thought, not a negative.

My friends coq au vin (sp?) was the taste bud version of viewing the Mona Lisa...incredible! 

Our server Adam was very helpful and complimentary! We liked him a great deal! Ill return for sure and will recommend others to go but will warn them to save some $$$ up bc they aint lettin' those pommes frites go for cheap!

Around these parts the goal is really just to avoid food poisoning and so far when it comes to New Ming Ling Kitchen, no food poisoning! It is consistently mediocre which is as good as it gets.

"I had horrible experience in trying to attend my birthday party here.  They claimed at the door that dress code is at the ""doorman's discretion"" which really translates to dress code is at the doorman's prejudice.  The lady, Masha, at the door claimed that we could not come in because we were wearing flat sandals and that it was a safety liability to wear such footwear so we couldn't come in.  She claimed that if we had arrived by 10 p.m. we could have entered with flat sandals but for some reason platforms, stilettos, and heels with the toes out were perfectly permissible after that time.  So in other words we could have rocked our flat sandals alongside the girls with the heals if we had showed up before 10 p.m.?  I still don't get how that makes sense...

When we began to question Masha at the door, she obnoxiously turned away from us and sicked the security guards on us.  We were not being overly demanding, loud, or ""ratchet"", we were simply asking her questions..  When the security guard came he cleared not only the group of four that I was with, but the whole line because he assumed we were all together because we were black.  

When we demanded to speak to the manager he did come down to speak to us.  He claimed that his staff said that we charged/bum-rushed the security line.  Excuse me?!  His security guards were like 7 feet tall and 400 pounds each and there were like four of them; we would be insane to do such a thing.  

What upset us most is that we thoroughly investigated the venue before we arrived and made reservations.  It does not state anywhere on their website that there is a dress code other than that it is ""casual.""  We were on the guest list for about two weeks prior to us showing up.  We were expecting a group of at least 20 people, so obviously it's the business' loss.  Once a majority of our party arrived we gathered in front and departed together.  However, even while waiting for our party the security guards still harassed us about standing on the sidewalk.  Again, excuse me?!  We have the right to be there any time of day or night.  Period.  It is, afterall, a public sidewalk.

I would not recommend this venue to anyone.  Their door service sucks, which could only be a precursor to what it's really like inside.",0.0

"This is an amazing restaurant with a very aggressive e-mail marketing campaign (grinning)!

We made a reservation here about 6-months ago and had to cancel because our sitter got sick. Since we did make a reservation, the restaurant now had our e-mail address. We would have forgotten about this restaurant if they didn't e-mail us weekly updates of their menu. Each menu looking better than the last. We finally decided to make another reservation and we were not disappointed!

The restaurant space is huge and beautiful. It combines a classic French and a modern feel. Lovely paintings and mirrors with extremely high ceilings. There is a lovely white marble bar in the center of the room.

The service is terrific. Our server was very attentive, he explained the 3 menu styles to us (prix fixe, chef tasting and omakase). We opted for the prix fixe menu. The server told us what his favorite dishes were and he definitely didn't steer us wrong. 

The food, oh the food!!!

The hors d'oeuvre was an avocado cigar on top of wasabi powder with a hot drink that had yogurt in it - It was delicious! The cigar wrapping was light and crisp. The avocado was smooth and delicious. The drink was warm and so good on an extremely cold night.

Sushi Sandwich & Burger - delicious! The tuna was melt in your mouth good. The burger had a heft to it and a delicious consistency. The ""sandwich"" was covered with black and white sesame seeds that were delicious. They also had a miso paste concoction that was so good!

King salmon carpaccio - amazing! Thin slices of salmon garnished with 2 types of caviar, sour cream and edible flowers. A small piece of rye bread was included on the plate. Delicious! The salmon was rich and flavorful.

Wagyu - American Wagyu beef that was soft and delicious. The sauce with black truffles was terrific.

Lamb - so so good! Soft and flavorful with no gaminess at all. The Anjou pear sweetness was a great compliment to the meat.

Chocolate mint soufflé - a fantastic end to a terrific meal. It was just delicious.

Chocolates - another gift from the chef - raspberry and lavender. So good!!

We also indulged in cocktails instead of our usual bottle of wine. I had a delicious almond milk concoction that took me back to my youth, it tasted like a mudslide! The hubby had a flowery cocktail that he thoroughly enjoyed.

The server and his staff were terrific! So helpful and friendly. At the start of our meal, there was a large ""pill"" in a dish. The server poured hot water on it and it expanded into a traditional Japanese hot hand towel. I said that our daughters would have loved to see that. When we were leaving, in additional to the pistachio madeleines, he gave us 2 of the expanding pills for our girls. Such a wonderful and attentive touch!!!

The restrooms were extremely clean and beautiful. They are located on the bottom floor of the restaurant, next to a beautiful event space/party room.

"What a gem. Amazing burritos and guap at a crazy good prices like who knew? I don't eat meat and I would never miss it again if I ate here every day. Service is quick and very chi. I go here usually on my lunch break and I'm not sick of it heh. 

The menu is small, which is a plus for me because big menus that are all over the place usually equal mediocre. This place is anything but.

"The fonue prix-fixe menu at this restaurant cannot be beat!  The food is all delicious and at $52 per person for three courses, it's perfect.  We got the Pyrenees cheese fondue (Swiss based) which was great.  Then one had the choice of chicken, filet mignon, hanger steak or pork (we got to choose two since there were two of us).  We had the chicken and filet mignon in red wine broth and it was the perfect amount of food for two- especially considering the delecable chocolate fondue was yet to come.  I could eat the milk chocolate fondue every day and nnot get sick of it.  Overall this restaurant has everything one looks for: ambiance, located close to the subway, great food and reasonable prices.",0.0
"What can you say about a food truck? The person who took my order was as nice as she should be. The different ice cream flavors are probably the highlight. We were boring so we just ordered the chocolate, mint chocolate and pistachio. Another thing I liked about their ice cream is it isn't too sweet and had a perfect texture, not too thick until you get sick of it and it doesn't melt too fast, so you don't have to rush when licking it on a cone. It was a super hot day, too and I was surprised how much my two scoops held up. Try it. It's probably the healthier options out there.",0.0
"Clarke's is near my office and our lunch group was looking for a different take out- sick of soup & salads. Ordered a Burger cooked Medium with fries and a drink, pretty good deal for $9 in midtown. It was ready really quickly, went back to the office and bit in to it- it was completely raw, the meat was red and crumbling. I decided to call and tell them and surprisingly the customer service was great. They found my 15 minute old order, and offered to re-make the burger and deliver it to my office. In less than 15 minutes they delivered a new burger (cooked!) and fries. When it's cooked- pretty tasty burger!",0.0
"ok, I havent gotten sick yet but the food we just received and barely ate was at best something you get off a street corner after hours in bombay.  I had the chicken vindaloo which looked like tomato soup, tasted like salty water with hot sauce added to it, and there were 5 small nuggets (quarter coin sized) of chicken and two small pieces of potato in it.  I will give two thumbs up for making the chicken white meat... way to splurge on that....

The vegetable samosas were good, congrats on understanding how to use a deep fryer.

The Channa Masala had no spice to it, it was over cooked

The white rice was excellent.. fingers crossed on that michelin award

Again, we did not get sick, but we were trying to understand how this place got any good reviews on yelp which made us try it.

Last note.. we have had indian food before, from curry hill to Mumbai.. we understand that it can vary greatly depending on the chef, night, size of the moon etc.. but this was a horrible first and last experience.

"My go to pho spot in chinatown. 
Super cheap and pretty good pho (~$5.50 - 8) and rice dishes (~$7-9)

The pho is slightly inconsistent - sometimes your noodle portions are larger, sometimes smaller, sometimes you get more meat, sometimes less, and recently the soup was too salty but somedays the soup is right on point. 

Even then it's still a decent place for your vietnamese food craving. The pho has always been fresh and I've never gotten sick from eating here. The grilled pork chop with rice and fried egg is really good too. 

The pho literally comes out in 2 minutes I kid you not lol and rice dishes are served up pretty quick too.  And a huge plus - they accept credit cards.",0.0

"BentOn used to be Cafe Zaiya which was previously the location of Oms-b.

Sorry to be a party pooper, guys.

I got the overhyped and overrated Friday chirashi special.  I took a Citibike over from my office to pick up this bowl and I've got to say, it wasn't really that worth it.  Sure, its like $8.95, but in my opinion and in this case, you really get what you pay for.

I showed up at exactly 12:54pm and there were two bowls left in the case - not sure if they had more in the back.  I was super excited and bought one immediately and left. There was no line at the time.

The chirashi bowl comes with tuna sashimi, salmon roe, unagi (eel), chopped green onion, and a little sprinkling of seaweed.  The sushi rice was okay - the rice texture was a bit too sticky in my opinion.  The tuna was not fresh at all and had a really strange texture to it.  I wouldn't be surprised if I'm sick later tonight.  The eel was tough and was the texture and consistency of canned mackarel, if anyone has ever had it.  The only thing good was the salmon roe.  In addition, you get a tiny cup half-full of cold miso soup with bad tofu.

As others have mentioned, there is no seating here.

"Finally made it to try the famous artichoke slice.  I hadn't eaten all day and when I walked by this place it's as if all the universes had aligned for that moment.  The slices are huge! It's basically two slices in one, which makes the $4.50 seem much more reasonable.  The first bite into that creamy sauce was delicious. The crust is super crispy how I love. The problem is, with each bite that followed the sauce tasted like heavy béchamel sauce with nothing special about it.  If I was drunk and eating this at 3 am I may have had a different impression but after four bites I just ripped off the crust, ate that and called it a day. Too sickening to enjoy.
I returned once more and got the margarita slice which was delicious! Would return for it. Only issue is that crust is my fav part and this crust was so burnt to a crisp that it was impossible to even bite into. 

Overall Not worth the hype, but you can def enjoy a slice from this spot.  Just don't wait on a long line for it.",0.0
"Certainly one of the more suspicious places I've ever shopped in. Case in point, walked in last week, looked in the refrigerated bin up front, espied 7 oz packages of President Low Fat Brie for fifty cents and purchased six. Why, I have no idea why. Sure they had a month left before they expired, but I have no interest in Low Fat cheese. Walked to the back, picked out six Portugese rolls for fifty five cents. At least I knew why I was buying those, they slice open real easy and make a nice sandwich for my two teenagers. Went home with forty two ounces of brand name, slightly bland cheese and six nice fresh sandwich rolls for under seven dollars. That is what East Village Cheese is, a place where you can buy food so cheaply you wonder if the staff goes out on a shoplifting binge every morning before opening the shop. I assume the inexpensive cheese is either flavors that didn't work out or cheese that Food Emporium didn't need anymore of. It's never made anyone in our family sick but we eat it fairly quickly after purchasing it. As to buying cheese that they actually slice, well that's a little more dicey. Consume it quickly. I've bought Stilton and Swiss among others and not had a problem. The rolls in the back are fresh early in the day and are a bargain. I don't mind paying cash so that's not an issue for me. The staff could be friendlier, they're not mean, just somewhat disengaged from their surroundings. Maybe a nine and a half hour day, what seems to me six day a week schedule grinds you down. They should stay open later but then again I like to think they're off somewhere loading up on cheap cheese. Of course I just had a frightening thought. Maybe, just maybe, they're charging the correct price for cheese. Is it possible that as New Yorkers we've so gotten used to getting gouged on everything that Boursin for $1.99 seems like an amazing deal?",0.0
"Lots of very negative reviews of this place from people with very few posts to their name? Anyway I found it to be OK. It was  a very humid evening and I had built up a pretty substantial hunger and unearthly sweat after returning from a run down the East River. I opted this over Chipotle because well....I am sick of Chipotle. I do like Lebanese food so ordered a veggie burger, 3 falafel and some humus and pita. While I was waiting I ordered a kale juice which 100% hit the spot. The service was fantastic. They could see I was really struggling with the heat after my run and so kept brining me water. They had run out of burger bins but I took pita with it anyway which didn't make a difference. The burger was good and not too greasy. It also tasted home made. The falafel were tasty, if a little small and the pita and humus very good. And very fresh given it is 2 days later and I am still eating that humus and it hasn't been in the fridge. Even the pita lasted that long and still tastes fresh. I will be back at some point to further explore the menu. This place is OK, I have certainly experienced better middle eastern fare but other's seem to have had  a much worse experience than myself.",0.0

For all the people giving this place 4+ stars, please do yourself a favor and go to Sushi Yasuda and have a real sushi experience.

When I went in this past weekend it had a few customers, but they kept coming in afterwards. It is a factory and not a restaurant, so even if 8 people are waiting for orders, space is tight.

I did buy a package of fried tofu, the one that's cubed. I made some yesterday with laksa soup and L really liked them. I'm not a fan of tofu, so for me it was simply an odd texture.

Order in since I'm home sick and all I wanted was soup and a smoothie. After an hour, I called to check in and see where it was and a very annoyed girl told me: yeah yeah it's on its way.

Ugh. 

So with my sore throat I call back. Annoyed girl answers sounding way put out that she has to answer a phone. I tell her what's wrong and missing. She says: too bad. we're closed. (Radio silence.)

Dessert on the other hand was lacking. The mousse is sickly sweet and the cake was dry and crumbling.  We left the dessert in tact.

"Not impressed.

My friend wanted to eat here so we did. 

When we first walked in, there was a strong smell (maybe urinal cakes? like a bad bathroom chemical smell) wafting into the front bar area. Yuck.

When we sat down in the back, I saw some of the burgers other people had and decided not to get a burger. So do keep in mind, I didn't get what this place is famous for. They just looked huge and not very appealing (I am more in the camp of quality over quantity when it comes to food.)

If what you want is a gigantic, huge burger at a reasonable price, then this place may be a good option for you. But if you want an excellent burger, there are a thousand better burger places in the city - don't kid yourself and think this is one of them.

I had a turkey club, which was OK. The bread was hard (not stale just a hard style of bread, not what I expected on a turkey club) which made eating it a challenge. Also, they served it with potato salad and cole slaw rather than fries... Yeah that's a mistake. Stick to the basics, sandwiches and burgers come with fries.

It wasn't terrible, and I didn't get sick from eating here, but I certainly won't be coming back. Thus... solid 2 stars.

The price was very reasonable for Manhattan.

"I bought five of the 5"" pies, but I had a Groupon for $40, otherwise I don't think I can justify paying $8 for a tiny dessert dish.

The banana coconut cream pie was probably my fave, but it wasn't exactly stellar.  I like my pies to be fluffy (like the ones from Pies 'n Thighs, SIGH) but this was one was a little too artificial tasting (what is it with the fake coconut flavor these days?) and there was no wow factor. 

I sampled the southern pecan pie and I put my fork down after a few bites because it was sickeningly sweet.  My mom also said their ""fresh"" peach pie was too sugary as well.

If you like super sweet things, this place is for you.  I gave away the Mississippi Mud Pie and the sour cream walnut apple to my friend and she loved it.  But then again, she doesn't have the greatest taste in food.  Yeah, I said it.",0.0
"ZERO STARS - I normally don't bother with bad reviews because it wastes my time with negativity, but I feel forced right now to vent.  I ordered dinner at 6:50pm on a Sunday night... Veg dumplings, veg lo mein & broccoli w/ garlic sauce. Nothing major nor difficult for ANY Chinese restaurant. I figure it should be here in 30-40 mins max and we'd be eating by 7:30p. I call back at 7:55pm to ask about the delivery. I got yelled at for using a credit card (so why is it an option), told it was a Sunday night so they're busy and because I used a credit card my food has not even left yet and it could take another hour. Are you kidding me? And you couldn't tell me that over an hour ago when I ordered so I could find a better option? Needless to say I cancelled my order instead of waiting 2 hours for Chinese food. I ordered out tonight because I'm sick, I've been cleaning all day and I have a child as well as myself who needs dinner, the last thing I wanted to do tonight was cook and wash a sink full of dishes.

Roof is really cool and quiet. I came around 5pm on a Friday, because i took the day off, so i was the first few folks hanging out here. I was seated at a table for two, with a great view of Chrysler building. Drinks were delicious, but it's NY price ($12-$15). There were 2 restrooms, one on the first floor before the elevator, and there is another next to the elevator when you exit the rooftop.

"Ponti Rossi is a recent addition to the rotating food trucks in DUMBO. While many of the other trucks are good, Ponti Rossi is excellent. There aren't any quality Italian options in DUMBO be it restaurant or truck, that is until these guys arrived. Here are just a few reasons why this is my go to truck everytime they are in the neighborhood (Fridays):

* Fresh, made to order food: This is especially important with pasta. The last thing I want is overcooked, soggy pasta. Al dente all day!
* A rotating menu: this means that they are always thinking about what options they could prepare given the ingredients they obtained for the day
* Speaking of ingredients: nothing processed. I had the Caprese Salad the other day and the Mozzarella di Bufala was outstanding
* This is a picky thing on my part, but it matters to me that the owners are actual Italians who love their food. I can't take a place seriously if they are butchering the pronunciation of their food

Like many places that get yelped, there's always a contingency who complain about pricing. So I eat out a lot, I have friends who own Michelin star restaurants, I LOVE food. With regards to pricing, yes, it costs a few dollars more than the other trucks, but they aren't what you would consider ""truck food"", it's better than any of the sit-down options around (which btw sit downs typically cost more than trucks, yet no one would complain in a sit down if they were charged what PR is charging for their dishes). The food is made to order, it is FRESH. So would I rather get a heavy order made from processed food that is ready in a minute and costs far less or would I rather wait a few minutes, pay a couple of dollars more to have a real meal. Oh one other complaint that I see: ""oh they have small portions"", I'm sick of reading posts from negative yelpers about portions. Their portions are appropriate and filling. The ""small portion"" complainers want super-sized 'mericuhn portions, which will get wasted when they don't finish.

"For months now, they have been unable to keep their bar stocked with decent beer. Unless you want Stella or Heineken, you are basically out of luck. Everything else on the menu is unavailable.  I am sick of it. The $10 burger at the bar is decent, though fries bring it to $15. I asked for swiss instead of the processed cheese, and that is a no go: apparently it costs too much to satisfy the customer. Not a 'regular' steak house bar: a bit cheap on the pour and never a buyback. So I recommend the Bar for it's brilliant location, people watching, view of Grand Central. But I would say it's better as a 'one and done' spot, however long you take, rather than a place to hang and drink. 
  
As for the steak, it's ok and the best for several blocks (though Benjamin's has better meat, cooked to order), but it's not brilliant or a big cut. Hence, in total, the two stars.",0.0
"So, my family & I order delivery from this place at least once a week spending anywhere from $40.00 on up. I usually never have a problem. The food is great, the delivery person spot on, as is the usual woman who takes the orders. Unfortunately, last week, I had the MOST horrible experience with this place. New person, took my order took her 3-4 times to get the order correct & they still sent white rice(which I had already ordered with a different combo) with beans. The order came & one order of the white rice was open, gross! Besides, I asked for 1 large arroz con gandules with one order. Called back, asked to speak to the manager, same girl said ""well you'll have to call in an hour"" & hung up. I called right back & explained to the usual woman what occurred. Now, I've never experienced this in 50 years living in NY. The woman said put the white rice & beans back in a bag & the delivery guy will bring the correct rice. He did. My question now is, who got the white rice that was open in the bag & since when do you make a mistake on a customer's order of food & ask for the food back?!? REALLY?!? I should also note that I've had them cater for me in July, when my Mom passed away & again in September, when my grandmother passed away. I've also had occasion to have catering done & very large orders of over $100. I won't order from here again unless things change. I'm thoroughly disgusted. Why did I wait a week to add my review? I've been very sick. So now, I'll find a new place & that's a shame because my whole family loves this food. I'm not spending my hard earned money where I'm treated so rude & no one took the time to apologize, except the delivery guy!!!",0.0
"Really really really good! I went with a large party and we split several dishes, all of which were great, but the highlights were as follows: burrata appetizer (just perfect), octopus appetizer, bread pudding dessert and, my personal favorite, the swordfish. I think I would be extremely content eating this swordfish dish every day for a month and never get sick of it. One of the best cooked pieces of fish I've ever had.",0.0
"The food here isn't bad if you go for what they do well. The tandoori chicken isn't bad, the breads are decent, and the rolls are convenient, some of their curries are tasty. The desserts are pretty bad for some reason (I've had all of them). And for the record I've only had delivery from this place. 

That said, every time I order food from them, the naan bread (in foil) is wrapped around the cold sodas in the bag. I guess it's to save space or something? The result is that the drinks are warm and the breads are cold. Ultimately this is a waste of money since the breads are pretty awful if not fresh. And if they aren't fresh/hot they should cost $1, not close to $4 a piece. I've asked them to pack food sensibly but it seems to be a proactive illogical choice made by staff there, at least at the times of day I order. 

Please learn how to pack your food. Pack the drinks separately or at protected from the hot food somehow. Sick of wasting my money only to reheat soggy bread and refrigerate warm flat soda. Will be the last time ordering from this place unless I'm desperate for cold oven-cooked food and hot sodas.",0.0
"This is Everyman's pub.  Very woody but not overly spitshined and polished.  Just old wood everywhere.  This place could be in any city with a population over 50k.  It's a good ""comfort zone"" for people who are sick of slick NYC establishments, overly publicized joints, trendy showy fad places, etc.  Say it's been a long, stressful day and you don't want to have to impress anyone or keep your guard up.  You just want to sit your ass on a stool and suck up some suds, watch a game, chit-chat without having to advertise your IQ to get respect.  You may not know anyone in there, but you feel as though you COULD know everyone in there.  The food is simple but made well.  No pretense, but tasty and honest.  Just like the clientele.",0.0
"FAVORITE BRUNCH IN THE USA!!
I travel a ton and get sick of the same-old same-old egg breakfast. If you want something different, savory delicious, hot and yummy, then try this place. If you are in the city it's worth the trip to east Bklyn to try this joint. And the coffee is fabulous. I am a huge Ethiopian food fan to begin with but I never had Ethiopian breakfast. I came in expecting to get a standard combo plate. I was a little sad at first when I realized they only had food from their brunch menu.

"This Review is particularly about the mussels. I just had a bowl filled with their scrumptious white wine based mussels and my stomach is killing me, not because there was anything wrong with the mussels but because I scarfed the huge bowl down in about 20 minutes and now I feel sick. They are absolutely delicious! They have just the right flavor! They are not too salty they are not too garlicky -they are just yummy Yum yummy and I highly recommend that if you like mussels, you order them for yourself.  I asked for a side of mashed potatoes and those were also delicious.",0.0
"Came here to meet with a couple professors and sponsors from my alma mater since they made a reservation at this restaurant. 4 of us ordered the Lobster, Corn, and Hash. In my opinion, it wasn't great. It just tasted a bit ordinary and looked like it was 80% corn, 15% hash, and 5% lobster. The eggs that went on top were delicious however. I brought my leftovers home and reheated them later in the day to see if I was just sick and didn't have my taste buds on me, but it still tasted the same and I was still not impressed. Would come back to try something else some other time. 

Would give it 4 stars because we saw Tony Shalhoub eating there as well - but just thinking about all that corn makes me keep it at a 3.",0.0

1) I got the mofongo, ropa vieja, rice with red beans, and Kola Champagne. All of the dishes were great.

"Best general Tso's chicken I've had by far. Had it with brown rice. Would categorize it more under gourmet Chinese food. Really good. The restaurant itself has a modern vibe to it. They have a huge chalk board with their specials on it in different color chalk. They also have a pretty cool logo. First Chinese takeout restaurant that I see the people having a ""uniform"" which is a shirt with the logo on it. 

Bottom line: food is great, will def. come back again

"No, sorry, that's defintely a no.

The bored lady behind the counter was rude, kept us waiting for Fettuchini Bolognese which tasted like dog food, not even salt in it, not to speak about other seasoning. Spaghetti w. Meatballs were okay, but you have to be a really bad cook to fail on those.

Having the surprisingly good Yelp Reviews in mind (which led us to this place) I have no other choice but to give one Star. Which means: we didn't get diarrhea and didn't not instantly throw up after the meal.

"so apparently, the back patio here turns into a massive beer garden during the summertime. unfortunately, my first visit to this establishment was a couple of weeks back, in the dead of winter so i missed out. however, there are a few defining attributes (for me personally) about tuttles that will eventually have me returning.

(1) $1 oysters ALL DAY, ERRDAY. you can't really beat that. they're also fresh, gigantic, meaty, delicious...

(2) can confidently say that their loaded beef nachos easily falls under my ""top five best nachos i've ever had"" list. a must try.

"I am currently wrapping up day 3 of the Excavation Cleanse.  Overall I was very pleased with my experience here.  The juices were fresh and delicious (although right about now I'm pretty sick of the green juice) and were delivered to my door at the scheduled time and packaged immaculately.  I would have given this four stars but I just think it is so expensive. I bought this cleanse with a Gilt City deal so I paid $130 for a three day cleanse.  Normally this is significantly more, and that's crazy. I had a hard time convincing myself to pay $130 for it.   The juices and cashew milk were delicious though.  I also like that the calorie level was high enough that I didn't feel a significant depletion in energy, I was still able to go to yoga although I did get very sleepy at times.  I will be glad to be done with this though tomorrow and back on to normal food.",0.0
I love the concept of this place. I got the burrito with Kalbi. The Kalbi was really good and the purple rice is also great. Don't get the black beans. They weren't fully cooked and hard. I hope I don't get sick from them. :( I would go back though.,0.0

Drinks took a while to hit table so manager comped them. Awesome. Gorgeous lighting, atmosphere, and decorations. Also has outdoor seating. Fyi- menypages menu is wrong & outdated. They no longer have nutella french toast. Also they ran out of a fruit focxacia we ordered & it wasnt until the food hit the table that the server told us -__- would I return?

"Unfortunately ever since Graham Ave closed I've been trying to find a spot that could replace (in some way) the beloved Godfather hero, which is basically all Italian meats. I tried the Italian and thought ok since this is $13 (the most I've ever paid for less than a 12-inch hero) it will blow me away. Wrong. The meat consisted of a total of 7 slices of meat, I counted, and two thin slices of mozzarella, not the fresh kind either. The sandwich was overpowered by vinegary condiments and soaked through. The bread was a semolina sesame that had to be a day old. Oh let's not forget the long hair in between the meat. Delicious! I go to Anthony and Sons Panini for reasonably priced and far superior sandwiches. Sick of these gimmicky places charging for mediocrity.",0.0
"""Shocked""

I checked into this place and got a Maverick badge and I was surprised to see what that meant. I guess you get one of those badges when you go to places with low ratings. 

I have been coming (I still call it FIGO) to this place a little over 5 years because it is really close to work. Well, I did not visit when they had the C rating for a while. Usually, we come here when we cannot decide on what to eat for lunch because they have EVERYTHING here!! Sandwiches - got it. Third-rate  sushi - got it. Mexican food - got it. Korean food - got it. Udon and ramen - got. Hot/cold buffet - got it. And the list goes on. Even though they have every type of food nothing is really THAT amazing. Of that list,  I really like the udon and the mixed seafood salad in the cold bar. 

The prices are very reasonable and I have mot gotten sick from the food (*knock on wood). They place only has about 10-12 and it is always full of people during the lunch rush. Now, that the weather is nice you can eat in the park. 

I mean the food can not be That bad to induce food borne illnesses because many doctors and nurses eat here. 

So I recommend this place if you are with a couple of people and none of you can decide on a common cuisine. It beats McDonalds and it is open 24 hrs. Note, you cannot get customized sandwiches during the late nigjt/early morning hours.",0.0

But let me address the sweets for the people who enjoy pastries, cakes, cookies and things of such. The owners and bakers in this establishment are so damn creative - it's sickening! I've indulged on homemade banana bread made with Nutella, ginger bundt cake made with guiness, lemon tart, three milk cake with papaya...with occasional special treats such as Foccacia and herbed goat cheese with cucumber on some special type of bread (that I cannot remember the name of) but you catch my drift!

"I frequent here before I became a pastry chef, and I still come here for my baking supplies and advice. I have never had a bad experience here, but I have to say that I have been witness to customer's bad behavior, towards the staff here.  The hole in the ceiling was the result of the heavy showers that we have been getting here in NY, of which it took the owner less than 2 days to get fixed.  As a small business owner that is impressive. I have witnessed customers coming in asking for cryptic things.  I find complaints come from the hobbyists and the amateurs.  Who are either curious to try something new, or really don't know what they are looking for.  The store is small enough that one can observe it from behind the counter, and all of the staff graciously always ask the customers if they need assistance. They are not mind readers, and I feel that people in their own mindspace don't realize this, or the crappy baggage they carry around with them WHERE EVER they go.
I highly recommend this store due to its wall to wall supplies for the professional and the newbie.  If there is a new item out chances are they have it. The owner's knowledge is kitchen and street smart being able to provide short cuts for any baking/decorating dilemma.  
All in all, it sickens me how insensitive and empowering people can be having the ability to post negative comments here. I denounce them as I refer people here and all of the feedback has been positive.  I appreciate this establishment,  their selection, their prices, their location (food is awesome out here).

"The worst. The worst bar none. It pains me because it's so close to my house, but I can no longer go there. 

The management of the pharmacy is terrible. Not only have I been sent home with the wrong prescription, but when I returned it they were not apologetic in the least. (I fear to think what might have happened were I am old person, or sick, or not paying attention.)

The staff is harried, disorganized and incompetent. They struggle to find prescriptions, make customers call out their names and birthdays. Forget the twenty minute wait just to pick up a prescription.

For a full month they strung me along saying they'd ordered a drug for me--nothing special, easily filled elsewhere but Rite Aid is so close to me and my favorite pharmacy Health AId closed--that  finally I had to take the prescription back because it was about to lapse. It was filled within an hour at Neergard on 7th.

The pharmacist was so upset she said the management of the pharmacy was terrible, she was afraid given the slipshod way the place was run that she could lose her license. Not to mention the fact that she was paid less than at her old pharmacy job. 

Now that a new pharmacy has opened up on 7th Avenue between 6th-7th streets--in the space Health Aid occupied--I am filling my prescriptions there.",0.0

"I met the original owner and chef of Taiwanese Specialities when I was a kid back in the 80s. He used to have a small little spot in the food court on 78th Street and Roosevelt ave in Elmhurst down the street from me. This was the time when good authentic Chinese food was a bit harder to find outside of Chinatown. I was already a fan of his cookings back then. Fast forward many years later he opened up Taiwanese Specialties at the current location and it immediately became the go-to place for me and my family. (We are from Taiwan). 

This is the place where you can get down right Taiwanese comfort food with authentic taste and all the flavors to make you home sick. I have taken many friends there (Asians and Westerners) and it was always one of the places we go as a family for special celebrations. Some of our favorite and best dishes are: oyster pancake, fried fermented bean curd (stinky tofu), beef w chili peppers, clams, Crispy Fried Intestine, water crest, spinach, etc. it's all good. 

My only complain is the it's cash only and it seems like the have raised the price in the past years. It's still not too expensive but being in an area with endless options of good food, I found myself visiting less because of the price. But I will always come back here when I have my Taiwanese cuisine craving, even if it's a 25 minute drive.",0.0

Let's talk about why there's not a five star rating. Yelp reviews failed me this time around. You guys said this place was better than Carmine's and IDK if you were drunk or sick but NO their food is NOT better than Carmine's...but their service definitely is! Also because I still think I'm 14 and social media controls my life, I just need answers as to WHY do you have a party room in the basement where ppl have NO SERVICE (or wifi)? I had to go upstairs to make sure ppl in my party would know we were downstairs once they arrived (annoying). I couldn't even post my cute videos on my snapchat (#dontjudgeme -_-)

However, the service here was amazing!!! From the time I booked the reservation until the moment I paid the bill. The staff was so accommodating and my waitress was EVERYTHING (without her I would give this place 3 stars). The food was good as well and satisfied all 15 ppl in my party.

"Want to get sick and overpay for food? Come to Grace's Marketplace!

This place is disgusting. The fruits in the refrigerated section are regularly covered with mold and the employees make it worse. For example, I just pointed out a box of figs which is filled with mold to two people who work here. I'm literally standing here watching them pick out the moldiest figs with their bare hands. They are leaving the less moldy figs in the box, as well as the figs that don't look moldy but were in direct contact with the mold. And they're placing the boxes back on the shelf. This place is a health hazard. 

They're also not changing the price of the fig boxes even though they were priced by size, and they've just removed the moldiest figs. So they're ripping off their customers.

"I want to make clear, I'm giving this rating not because there was anything wrong with the food or the service, but for one reason and one reason only.  This branch of Pizza Hut hates apartments.  They have this horrible policy which says that their delivery person can't come into the building, so anyone ordering from an apartment has to come downstairs to the front door and pick up the food.  Have a baby sleeping and can't leave?  Tough.  Feeling sick and need to stay in?  Too bad.  Not only do you have to pay a delivery fee, but they won't even bring it to your front door.

"We have been eating at Souen since they originally opened their doors.  They are the only completely organic restaurant in our area which is the single reason we continue to eat there.  

After they were closed by the health department and amazingly allowed to reopen we thought the experience would be improved.   Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The food is what it is, some days it's better than others (at least now you won't be sick from it).  Souen's food could be much better with a bit more care, such as not overcooking vegetables.  

The real issue we have is a few of the people who take orders over the phone or work behind the front counter should not be working in a restaurant or any type of service oriented job.  They consistently forget or just don't care enough to include all of the items we order or integral components of them, such as, salad dressing, sauces, etc...  When we have modified an entree they often serve it or pack the item to go without the modification.  These issues happen with such frequency we are forced to check our take out orders by opening every container prior to leaving, which is the primary reason we discontinued delivery.  The icing on the vegan cake is that these people treat us as if we are an inconvenience to them.  This seems to be an issue at the Souen in SoHo as well.

My suggestion is for the owners of Souen to have a few lunch and dinner experiences at Angelika's Kitchen where the people working there are nice and the food is excellent.  You have an opportunity to really be a good, healthy restaurant with very happy customers.",0.0

The miso cod appetizer was as buttery as we have imagined while the sushi entree just blew us away with the quality of the fish. The only complaint we had (hence the 4 star rating) was that the server was rude enough that it was obvious that she was sick of the restaurant week attention already. 

All in all, nobu next door was a slam dunk for restaurant week, and we will definitely visit again.",0.0
"It is very apparent that your paying for the WOW factor and not an edible sandwich. It is built for the eyes not for the palate or the stomach. It is nearly impossible for one person to finish any of their sandwiches. Ordered a Woody Allen and was semi-appalled by the amount of meat. Maybe some people want to get the most out of their money (considering the sandwich is $26) but I would rather have a sandwich I can eat to finish and won't be sickened by the end of it. The staff seemed like they all wanted to jump off a bridge, no smiling faces or greetings. I would have normally given one star but I did enjoy the matzo ball soup so they get two. 

I really wanted to like this spot...I really did. Carnegie deli has the air that it was once special, maybe a neighborhood deli, but has since become a place for tourist wanting a Man VS Food experience.",0.0
"Toilet sushi. Sorry, guys. Sushi rolls were served wrapped in warm rice, ew I want to vomit thinking about it. I keep thinking about this one tuna roll that had remnants of tuna on the outside of the roll, on the rice, from the knife that cut it having not been wiped clean. Really skeeves me out. Haphazardly made rolls, not good quality fish. Service sucked, which is weird because you order from an iPad. I won't go again.",0.0
"I have visited the place multiple times, but today was the worst. I do not like give one star, but I had to. Read the reasons why below.

- The bread seems old because it the bread started to fall apart in my hands. 
- The meat was well down, but how is that possible when I just placed my order 1 min ago. I pray they didn't give me a canceled order meal, because I refuse to get sick this week.
- The sweet potatoes fries looks old too; now I am wondering about my meal.
- I went to get ketchup and bbq sauce from the station, all container needed to be refilled. In addition, they had no ketchup thingy. You know the small cups. I had to walk to the back of the room to get bloody cups. 
- I have informed the rep the containers were empty, assuming she will go tell someone to fill them up. ""You can find ketchup in the back"".. Really. Ok. I am so done with this spot. 
- I have took a bite, of the burger and stopped, because I still wondering about the bloody burger. 

Look I am out, I love to eat, I cannot micro manage reps in preparing my correctly. $9 dollars went to waste. SMDH!",0.0
"I've tried a lot of burgers in my life. I lived in NYC for 7 years and now in San Francisco, and trying different burger joints was probably the foodie trend that I enjoyed the most. But my heart always returns to Paul's. Maybe because it was a few blocks from my dorm when I was a freshmen at NYU. Maybe it was because after being there countless times, I've only been served by the same two waitresses. Maybe because their prices are so cheap. Maybe because they once delivered my order to Soho even though I was under the $10 limit because I was too busy to get up there. Maybe because sometimes you just want a giant, juicy, greasy burger and you're sick of this grass-fed 4 oz house made ketchup bull shit on an english muffin. Maybe because, despite the tourists and NYU students, the regulars there are also cops, firemen, and blue collar New Yorkers who need a real burger. Paul's is burger purity.",0.0
"The lamb noodles here are one of the great dishes of the world. My partner didn't have her life rocked quite like I did, partly because she has a phobia of difficult-to-navigate noodles, which these are, and partly because not a lot of people love cumin as much as I do - but, I mean, she still loved it. Those noodles are sick, man, sick. 

We also grabbed a cucumber salad that was terrific and  pork burger (? that is not what it is, it's pork & stuff shoved into a bun) that was just pretty good.

I know you heard about this place from Andrew Zimmern or Bourdain or whoever, so you're all ""man, I don't want to go to some place with a line around the block with people who saw a place on tv,"" so the good news is this is their other branch - maybe they're slammed on weekdays? Do people work in this neighborhood? - but on Sunday at lunchtime there were plenty of seats. Also, the other good news is that it's super good food.",0.0
"I really loved this place for a while ...until I kept getting violently sick.  Let me explain my short lived relationship with hamburgers.... I was strictly a white-meat only kind of girl until I was introduced to Shake Shack. I had my first burger ever here and I loved it. I loved it so much that I would crave a bacon cheeseburger weekly. 

I didn't eat Shake Shack much but after the first couple of burgers I began to get violently ill. Abdominal cramping, sweats, and frequent bathroom visits. I thought maybe it was just a flukey thing but it kept happening every time I ate it. 

 I stopped eating burgers all together again. I miss them, yeah. I wish I knew what was making me so sick. Did they change the meat quality? The cheese? Whatever it is, its no longer the same.

It is greasy and soggy but something about it made me fall in love.",0.0
"I'm sick of this place's terrible delivery service. We went from ordering lunch here about once a week, but now the food is coming 45 minutes to an hour late, which is about 1:30-2 hours after we ordered. It ruins our entire lunch break, and messes up with our work schedule. There's like 3 dozen vietnamese restaurants in the area, just order someone else like how we're learning to.",0.0
"Since taking out my wisdom tooth, I've been on a hunt for different kind of soft food for a week. Since I'm really tired of the Chinese porridge, I decided to give Korean Porridge a try. I ordered the kimchi and octopus porridge, to go. It took about 15 minutes to prepare. Each option was about $13-$20. It's on the pricier side, but they definitely have higher quality ingredients. The porridge is thick and very tasteful. It's definitely better than the bland congee (Chinese porridge) that I've been eating. 

I don't think I would come here often since ultimately porridge is not main choice for me. But it's definitely a good choice for the sick days.",0.0
"All i have to say is i hope they had an off day and the chef called in sick. This Used to be one of my favorite diners, but After yesterday...not so much. 
They added a beautiful outdoor patio; but what happened to the taste of the food? Everything was bland and over cooked!  from the burger, to a swiss cheese omelette, to a Cobb salad. we also ordered a chicken souvlaki for the table, and sadly, that too, tasted like gummy chicken w/ no seasoning at all. 
The service was off, Plus one of the waitresses didn't know what greek lemon potatoes were...at a greek diner! AND they were on the menu.

"Not the best Jamaican restaurant at all. Every time I eat there I have diarrhea. The food is fresh at nights when they are about to close and not so fresh in the afternoon/evening hour which is very weird to me. I don't recommend at all..... Save your money or go elsewhere. By the way, they don't know the parts of a chicken, depending on who's serving. I always get the breast when I order leg&thigh.",0.0
"I am giving this place one star because it has really poor ventilation. The air is suffocating and filled with the smell of toast, gas, and smoke from cooking. It is very unhealthy. I came here to get work done and was very disappointed with the air. I felt like I was poisoning my lungs. 

The food is decent and the coffee is good. But they really need to do something with the air. It isn't a cozy comfortable place either. Very cramped.",0.0

I was also happy to have come early as the place packed out a little after we put our order in.

"Technically I didn't shop here however, L's mom did. She did her monthly grocery shopping earlier this year at this particular supermarket and she was quite unhappy with the meat quality. Initially I doubted her, how could their meat be that bad, aren't they known for selling large quantities/varieties of meat? Yet when she cooked her usual Latin dishes with the raw meats purchased from this location, it definitely had a rancid taste. I don't recall if we got sick from the food, but whichever red meats she bought, all of them tasted off. 
They seem to have good deals for some pantry items, but I can't seem to convince either myself or L to shop here after that. Especially since another review confirmed  the quality issue. Either they don't throw out expired meat or they missed a couple of packages by accident. I usually check the expiration dates on packages and I tend to read labels so I probably wouldn't have had this issue with the meat.",0.0
"If you like whiskey go here, you won't find a better selection anywhere else. I was able to try Pappy Van Winkle here for the first time (definitely an awesome whiskey although I wouldn't spend hundreds of dollars on a bottle.)

The grilled cheese is excellent and so is the environment, this is exactly the kind of place I would recommend winding down at on Friday night after a long hard week at work. The first time I came here was on my birthday, and even though I was extremely sick and just sat against the wall feeling like death I still loved it and wanted to go back.

They even have a nice backyard which is a really great place if you enjoy a cigar with your whiskey after the best grilled cheese you've ever had.",0.0

"Stopped in for a coffee on my way to work and to see what kind of baked goods they had since I needed a cake for the same evening. Amazingly, there were 2 cakes in the display case that were available; a vanilla cake with mocha cream filling and a chocolate cake with coconut cream filling. Um, delicious! I picked up the chocolate cake to go and had an americano. The americano was strong, delicious and was cheaper than Starbucks. I love supporting smaller companies and this place is definitely one I will be coming back to. Brought the cake to a birthday party and everyone died it was so good! It was moist, rich, and sweet with the coconut cream filling but not too decadent, It was the perfect amount. If you are looking to pickup a cake and sick of the normal options from Whole Foods or shy of the price from a cake shop, this is the place to go. You can even order custom cakes a few days in advance. Delicious.",0.0

"We were biking all the way out to find a random burger truck that's gotten written up a lot lately, and when the burger truck was nowhere to be found, we stood around pissed off for a while before turning to Yelp and finding this joint sort of nearby. It turned out to be even better than the burger probably would have been, and the surprise was that we used to live not far from their other original location on University Place near Union Square. Following a law suit that resulted from delivery employees who were being beaten and paid a couple dollars an hour and working 60+ hours a week, that place changed it's name and stopped delivering for a long time. We always wondered why the food came so quickly and was so hot - they were beating them! And so, with no delivery options, we stopped ordering from them, even though they had the most delicious pork chops and spare ribs in town. 

Fast forward to now, and us sitting in their brand new location, with the original name(!!), right smack in ... THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Seriously, we had to google what neighborhood this was in. Has anyone ever heard of the Flatlands? Why would they open a shop here?! Regardless, it was pretty amazing. The pork chops were so soft, juicy and flavorful and perfect. If it weren't so far away from where i currently live, I'd go several times a week. Owners: open one in or very near CLINTON HILL, BROOKLYN!!!  It would do amazingly well, we have no good Vietnamese here to speak of, and you'd have a built-in audience of hungry hipsters who are sick of the New American bullshit that keeps opening up around here. DO IT!!!!! :) I beg of you.

One criticism: the fried Vietnamese spring rolls were excellent, but they were not served classically with mint and lettuce and such, but as a typical spring roll with dipping sauce. They were good, but I wanted to wrap them up in mint and lettuce as I would at any Vietnamese restaurant. Other than that, the service was good and the food came out incredibly fast. I'll be back if I can ever find my way back to the Flatlands again.",0.0
"My co-workers and I were so sick of overpriced Treehaus and cafe today and were so glad that we found Red Olive. 

You more for your your buck.. What I like about Red Olive is they have seaweed salad and (imitation) crab salad. It goes so well with the hot buffet. 

7.29 / lb is cheaper than cafe today and treehaus... I brought my co-workers here once and now we come here at least once a week. 

The only thing is the hot buffet is against the wall which makes it ""cozy"" when trying to grab your food.",0.0
"I just returned from London after attending school for a few months. During my time there, I fell in love with the fish and chips and have been dying to find authentic British fare to remind me of what I miss so dearly. After reading the reviews on yelp and other places, I thought this would be outstanding...but it wasn't. First, let me say that the service is exceptional. The staff are very kind and attentive. I ordered a cod and chips dinner. To me, it wasn't expensive. In fact, it was about the same I paid in London or a casual dining place like red lobster, if not cheaper. The chips were definetly British style; very hearty, thick and tasty. But the fish was sickening. It had a weird egg taste and smell that made my stomach turn, something I have never experienced before. I ended up eating just the crispy crust batter and throwing away a substantial amount of the fish itself. The tartar sauce (which was free) is also different but tasty nonetheless. Everything was received piping hot, which I assume they made it fresh.  Honestly, I'm curious to try the haddock as everyone recommends. But I won't be speeding to get here anytime soon. I also read a lot of the reviews which complained about the fish needing seasoning or being too bland lol....British cuisine is infamously known for that so don't be alarmed. Overall, I think I'll leave my expectations in London, I won't be returning for awhile neither would I recommend it. But kudos on their service.",0.0
"I normally don't do restaurant reviews but this time I'll make an exception. Please be aware of the restaurant ""East Manor"" located near Gold City Supermarket, particularly if you eat dim sum. Ate there this morning with my family for dim sum and hory shet it was a terrible experience. The food was bland, dry, little to no taste and for fuck's sake the noodles weren't even hot! Oh, and they didn't even cook enough! Some of us had very little, while others had a lot. No proper proportioning. When the chefs don't even have the patience to cook enough or even HEAT IT UP, you've got a big problem. The only thing that was actually decent were the egg tarts and that was a pretty long wait. Don't even get me started on the service. Not one person was walking near our table and most of them didn't even know what the hell they were doing half the time. One of them was too busy pouring tea for tables that he didn't have the fucking time to write down one of our orders. Hello, jackass. It takes like 5 seconds to write down an order. It was ONE order. Not complicated. They still charged us 15% service. Service? What service? We pretty much had to serve ourselves. If the show ""Kitchen Nightmares"" was still showing, I would definitely vote for this place to be featured. There have also been reports about food poisoning, so be on the lookout. This restaurant wasn't this terrible before, but lately its gone to shit.

TL;DR : Fuck East Manor.",0.0
"Solid food at a decent price, which can be tough to find in NYC.

Quality-wise, you won't be blown out of the water, but you also won't be sick later over it. My wife got the falafel over rice and liked it. I got the kebab. Hers was a decent portion for the price, whereas mine was a bit skimpy. That being said, I stole some of hers, and called it a day there. We grabbed some off a cart and enjoyed eating it in the park people-watching.",0.0
"The food here was truly exceptional, but as to expect with some Michelin starred places, the portions were not large. There were probably 20 courses, which left you satiated, but not full. 

I didn't go for a 5 star rating here, and likely would have gone lower due to service, but I wanted to lean my rating more toward the food.  I was pretty unhappy with how my family was treated prior to eating at Chef's Table, as we all got very sick the week before our reservation, and when my father-in-law called to cancel and mentioned that we had the flu, the restaurant pushed that they in fact had a week in advance cancellation policy. So, if you don't cancel a week before they will charge you your full meal price. So if we all didn't go, we would be out over $1000. 
So my husband and I, not feeling great sucked it up and went, and we last minute wrangled in two of our friends to come instead of having two empty seats and over 500 bucks down the drain. 
I understand having a fee for cancellation, this isn't unique but even $100 would have been reasonable, the full meal price just seemed exorbitant to me.

Now onto the food. I love seafood and sashimi, so if you like those things, you will be in luck. They had many standout fish courses, and sashimi of fish from Japan I had never heard of. The crab and lobster were amazing, and I never normally like duck, but their duck dish with crispy skin was so tender and not gamey at all. My husband loved the foie gras and the kobe beef. All in all the execution of the courses was timed very well, and the presentation enticing. 

I preferred this tasting courses I've had to other 3 Michelin starred dinners I've had, as it's more the food I would normally order for myself, vs. something more conceptual, but the customer service, before and during the dinner (the staff didn't seem overly happy to be there) leaves something to be desired.",0.0

"It must have been an off day as the waitress told me a few ppl called out sick but I think the service lacked and could have been better. 

The way things should work here is that you get your drinks, ""shares"" which are usually granola, pastries, juice, then ur main. This is how my meal went:

I made a 1230 Saturday brunch res on opentable but got delayed and was able to make it 1 pm when I called which was much appreciated. We were seated immediately but the waitress came after awhile and apologized. We ordered coffee but it never came until the 3rd time that I asked for it from a 3rd person. The weird part is that all other tables seated before and after us got their drinks and shares before us. We got an ala carte item first then our mains and we had to mention our shares. 

Besides the service which I assume to be bc they were short staffed, the food is delicious!  Mushroom and scrambled egg puff pastry was well seasoned and fluffy pastry. Merguez dish was tasty and comforting, bananas foster French toast was amazing!  

Would try again for dinner and brunch, hopefully on a full staffed day.",0.0
Right next to my office. Come here at least 3 times out of 5 days. Always get the udon with chicken. Still not sick of yet. The sushi it's bad either.

"As you know from my previous review Ltauha is at the top of their game as far as restaurants go here for the Ridgewood area. Please have a look at my pics for some of the dishes I've had and know each and every dish is well prepared, fresh, delicious and exceptionally priced for Brunch, Dinner, desserts & beverages. You just can't go wrong with dining here. 

What stood out for me today and why I am updating this review is two things.

1. I cannot eat shrimp anything from any restaurant without getting violently ill, now I like shrimp but eating this seafood outside of a home prepped, cleaned and cooked dish  will illicit unsightly things. I took a chance today since I'm fairly close to home & a hospital and I'm a risk taker of sorts to have their shrimp and grits dish ( I just couldn't resist ), I explained to the manager that I have an allergy to shrimp from restaurants and she assured me that they clean, prep and cook their shrimp well so I shouldn't have this reaction. I order the dish because I will react with the 1st shrimp and within minutes, Damn, the dish looked so good and tasted even better, I ate, and ate and I did not get sick at all! Another hit dish for Ltauha and excellent tasting too!

2. They now have their Liquor license in place, officially serving beer & wine as of this writing and expect to be in full swing with the Liquor by the end of this week. Woot, Woot, I like to have the option of a mixed cocktail with my dinner and now that just became possible at this lovely restaurant!

If your ever in the neighborhood, you really should give this place a try, ambiance, food and pricing is fabulous!",0.0
"I would give Trini Delite 4 out of stars for their food taste, but I dropped my rating to 3 stars because of two things: the worst customer service of all the roti shops in the area, and the high price/absence of menu items and their prices posted in the restaurant.

This is the Roti Police here and I visited Trini Delite today. I had been there once before a few months ago and had to walk out because of no customer service. A customer does not know where to place the order and with whom, the people behind the counter pretend that you are invisible even after standing about 10 minutes waiting to order, and these people really are full of themselves. 

Why is this a common complaint with all these West Indian restaurants? Do these people believe that because they own and run a business they have to look mean? Do the owners not have any education or common sense themselves to at least train their workers on an acceptable level of customer service to start? At least smile or be courteous instead of the sour faces these workers display when people come to buy. What a shame. Read the posts guys...the customers are not exaggerating about the sour faces these people have all the time. Don't get me started, but I am just sick of it also. I get more courtesy from the Chinese restaurant guys who are thought to have much less personality, but who try to step out of their personality and show their customers some warmth. It is not rocket science to understand how a smile and a greeting are important to any business. 

Anyway, about the food. I will be honest and say that it was very good. I ordered a curry chicken (with doubles chana and potato) with buss-up shot roti. Portion size was good, with four adequate pieces of chicken. Taste was very good as I stated, even though i do not like the dark green curry on chicken. Price was $1 higher than other roti shops; and of course you do not know the price until your order is at the cash register and they tell you the price; which is unethical people. Could you post a menu that everyone can see with the prices????

I will buy from them again, but only if they get their act together, do the opposite with their facial expressions, and post a menu like most restaurants do. The cooking is good, so I will venture into trying their doubles next week and report back.",0.0
"I been here a couple of times before but most recently I came last week with Lapin for brunch. When we arrived there wasn't much of a wait and we were seated rather quickly. Except, we got squished into a corner seat right near the cart where they put used dishes and glasses. Every time, they made a new deposit into that germ-ladden container our conversation would get cut off by a loud clank or food/water sprayed on us. Oh, why yes, I would love garbage with my meal...

Lapin ordered a coffee and our waiter who was sick and coughed several times without covering her mouth was efficient in the beginning but towards the end --- she forgot we were even there. We waited 35 minutes after asking for our bill four times. Lapin remarked that they were trying to keep us as prisoners. 

Lapin got the Old Fashioned French Toast with sausage and I got two scrambled eggs with fries.  The food was okay but for the price I thought it would have been a bit tastier. I feel like for the price and the quality, you could get similar food at a diner for a lot cheaper. Perhaps, it was just what we ordered and should have gone for lunch oriented menu items like we have done in the past. 

However, their strawberry cheesecake is divine and is definitely worth a trip to try their cheesecake.",0.0
"First of all I am not sure why this specific location has lower reviews than the other two locations... the Williamsburg location is by far the best of them all!

Now how can I summarize my love for Vanessas in one yelp review... I can't but I will try anyway.

I love Vanessas and you should too. The food is fast, f*cking delicious, and dirt CHEAP. As someone with a v. sensitive stomach I will even recommend this place, I have never felt sick, gotten a migraine or regretted eating here. 

Moving on to why I love it so much... the food!!! Obviously you need to get an order of #1 the pork and chive fried dumplings $1.25 for 4 you can't say no. My number one pick would be the chicken and basil boiled dumplings they are full of flavor AND you must add the hot and spicy sauce which comes with cilantro hot oil and hot peppers, yes please! The duck pancake is by far my favorite of the sandwiches, I recommend adding carrots since this one just comes with carrots. Also if you're getting a sandwich you may as well get the chicken/beef/pork noodle soup to dip it in. The chicken noodle soup was recommended to me by the staff and it blows your regular chicken noodle soup OUT OF THE WATER, seriously if you have a cold and you don't live with your mom but you need some nurturing, order this soup- you won't regret it.

Also possibly the cheapest beer in the area... so jump on that as well. It may not be the cleanest and you may have no where to put your trash but so what, this isn't fine dining, this is the best of the best cheap eats you can get.

"I am a big fan of Subway and go to a Subway for lunch at least 4 days a week. This location has failed so bad. I felt the need to write in to ""report"" how they are failing on the Subway website. 

Below is what I wrote to corporate:

I almost always get a Veggie Delite salad, or sometimes turn a Spicy Italian into a Salad. Every once in a while when a new sandwich comes out, I will give it a try.

Today I decided to get an Eggplant Parmesan  Footlong and a Spicy Italian Salad. 

The woman that helped me did not use a knife to cut the bread but instead tore it open using her bare hands (no gloves). I decided not to get the sandwich after seeing that and proceeded to order the salad. 

The lettuce was not fresh, and I guess it was rinsed in water in the morning when they put in in the case as it was soggy and dripping. The spinach was withered and most of the veggies were mixed up with other veggies. This is a problem for me as I am allergic to red onions. 

I let her finish the salad, but once I took it home I had to throw it away as there were 2 pieces of onions, and after seeing the withered spinach and soggy lettuce I was concerned that I might get sick from the lack of freshness.

Please please please, talk to this franchise owner. This locations needs to be trained on how to keep the veggies fresh and their workstation clean. Overall food safety training might improve this location alot. However I will not be back to this location. Which is unfortunate as I am in the area alot.",0.0
"oh man this place is my first foray into authentic mexican tacos/food and boy this did not disappoint. whenever I move into a new neighborhood I always try to scope out what fine establishments are around the vicinity, needless to say some places are absolute disasters and some places are absolute gems, this place is a gem. I've been here several times and order from here for delivery as well (which was prompt and effortless i might add). everytime I've come here the food was absolutely delicious and the service pleasant and extremely helpful. each and every single taco here is done extremely well, seasoned fantastically and topped off with the most bomb guacamole I've ever had, seriously I don't know why establishments like chipotle even exist poisoning the general populations perception of how mexican food should taste. the horchata here is absolutely amazing! it had the perfect blend of cinnamin with other spices as well as a hint of chocolate. as for the platter dishes with rice and beans, they were pretty typical, come here after a long day at court for whatever reason, for the tacos, buritos, chimichangas tortas etc ( My personal favorite is the al pastor meats though)  and you WILL NOT be disappointed.

"Hooray for Berg'n !........I have been trying for years to go to Smorgasburg with no  luck but lo and behold Berg'n opened which is like a miniature Smorgasburg.

Let's get to the food.......Ramen Burgers the new ""it"" food on the scene....we got the beef and Chicken Karaage and The Chicken Karaage won......it's Japanese fried chicken for heaven's sake!........I loved the Ramen Churros which come with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces.....my companion preferred The Ramen Fries

Burnt Ends are slamming........we got it in a slider and a pulled pork slider....it's all served with BBQ sauce and the best sliced pickles I've ever had......The Chicken wings are spicy but addictive!

Drinks:
For $23 we got  a beer......it was so good I told the bartender I wanted a light beer with a sweet finish.....The house cider was phenomenal it's served in a wine glass and it tasted like a nice crisp Chardonnay ......The Dark and Stormy is basically ginger beer and dark liquor....winning!

Dessert:
Why the heck not when it's Blue Marble and Dough!
We got a scoop of Sea Salt Caramel in a cup.....a nice tiny scoop so we needed to share the coconut donut!!!

My final take is this place rocks.....I've seen reviews about the wait and bar staff but I say take the stick out your butt and relax!
It's loud and depending on day and time crowded but the food rocks at reasonable prices and a wide enough variety to please the most discerning palates.....so check your attitude at the door grab a brew and a nosh.....you won't get bummed at Berg'n",0.0
"Giving a review for a pick-up. I'm currently sick as a dog and it's about 25 degrees in NYC. I called Shady Lady up for tortilla soup and a quesadilla to heal my soul, and told them I'd pick it up in about 20 minutes. I probably showed up about 5 mins late and had a friend jump out of the car to get the food, which was sitting on the cold bar countertop the whole time. 

Once I got home, I was SO UPSET. The tortilla soup was cold and disgusting. There was no avocado in it which is what the guy who works there said over the phone. It was bland and they prematurely put the tortillas on top of the soup so it was soggy. Basically I couldn't eat it. Then the quesadilla. Apparently they use Mexican cheese for the quesadilla which is fine, but the presentation made the quesadilla look completely inedible. The cheese was melted over top of the mushy tortilla. It was a freaking tragedy. I called up the manager who seems like a nice enough guy, and because of the time the kitchen was closed. 

The manager arranged for the delivery guy to bring our money back which was nice of the manager to do. He seems like he genuinely cares about the establishment. However, I won't be coming back. The terrible soup and quesadilla combo was $12 which is completely overpriced.",0.0
"If you ever crave terrific chicken soup when you're sick or perfectly meaty bites of ravioli, chances are you'll find it at Grano's.

If you'd ever like either of those items delivered within half an hour or ready to go within 10-15 minutes while getting takeout, chances are you shouldn't get it here. Chicken soup took 90 minutes to deliver. Ravioli took close to half an hour for takeout, and turned out to be an underwhelming small portion. 

Friend who ordered the soup (while sick) swears he's never ordering delivery from them again. 

And, I was not happy at lack of apology for taking so long. All I got was a bright, beaming ""thank you for waiting so long!"" I'd bet my low blood sugar that the tattooed woman manning the counter knew she could have said ""I'm sorry.""

Here's the thing- the food is friggin delicious. Friend swears the soup is among the best he's ever tasted. And I loved the ravioli. I just wish the kitchen would organize itself more so that it can serve this very delicious food within a reasonable time.",0.0
"Before I had to sit my best friend down and explain to him how much I hated the food and service, he'd force me to have dinner here every other month or so. FOR YEARS. It was a sick tradition. Waiters are often neglectful, and there's ALWAYS a long wait to get seated. Unfortunately, it's situated in a prime location and that's why we would end up returning. As with many other chain restaurants, the only good reason to come is for their happy hour on drinks and appetizers. Their sangria is my guilty pleasure - it comes in three delicious flavors and then served in a huge round glass. It's sweet, fruity, and the only reason I'll tolerate coming here. Fun fact: Because I attended high school down the block, a photo of my chamber orchestra is part of the wall mural.",0.0
"So I had to update this from 5 stars to 1 star because I am absolutely sick of this place's poor customer service. We order from this place weekly, at least; sometimes several times in one week. They know our names! However, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. we order they go into a 10-minute diatribe about how and why delivery isn't possible that day, why it will be delayed and why they don't want to come to our building because its ""so hard"" to find parking. 

Are you kidding me? 
Newsflash: This is New York friggin' City, people.

"I'm really upset...

Placed an order at 9am and was told same day delivery if it is done before 1pm. Never got the confirmation email. Asked that it be done expedited. 

Its 3:33 and its still not at its destination. For special requests I put deliver before 3:30. 

Whats the point of paying so much for a courier if it does not get to where it needs to be on time. 

The customer service here is great called and got updates and received a call back as requests.. however there is no way to track the item and know when it has reached its destination. The guy even called me back once it was delivered to let me know that it was done. I think for the price the in store service is great but the delivery service and coordination - not so much.

They charge so much and couldn't even get the order right - honestly - disappointed!
They forgot the tea- this is a get well basket specifically for being sick how do you forget one of the base ingredients. Refund was $3 for the tea- really that's all? I've spent more time on the phone calling to follow up throughout the day than anything else.

They substituted the James White Organic Apple and Crushed Ginger juice for rasberry - granted they claim it says substitutions will happen in a disclaimer on the email confirmation which i never got - but the whole point of a get well basket is to have things that will fight colds like ginger and lemon and tea.

Finally got the email resent to me now along with my supposed refund post delivery post mess-up!",0.0
"This Asian run deli operates hot and cold when it comes to quality food.  Some days the buffet offerings are crisp, tasty and well cooked, while more often than not other days find the buffet filled with soggy, grease coated fish, gravy soaked meat cuttings, vegetables and other mish mash items weighed down with grease and soaked in salt water. I use to get lunch there three days a week and have also found hairs in the chicken, unidentified droppings in ground tuna, as well as dried spider webs in the salad trays. So, you be the judge, eat and risk the chance of getting a disease or very sick, or avoid at all costs. I've decided after my last discovery in a vegetable patty resembling a potato patty that I can't afford the health risk. The managers of this Westside buffet-style restaurant are clearly incompetent and should be fired. Qualtiy control is a major problem.",0.0

I have yet to try something I do not like, and I am very picky. Roasted chicken, perfectly al dente pastas, salmon cakes, always freshly made and always delicious.

This place is a life saver.",0.0
"Worked around the corner from Sunac for two years and I've probably been there like 100 times. The place has great variety and the food is fresh, plus they have a few imported or rare snacks and drinks. It's a little pricy for normal human standards, but I guess it's kinda cheap for NYC. 

I never received anything that tasted bad from Sunac. It was a nice go to when I was sick of everything else in the area, and it was great to be able to hit up the buffet and be out the door within 5 minutes of entering. 

They don't rotate the buffet often enough though. I think they refresh the menu once a year or something, but the options were too similar between days.",0.0

Seriously, whatever I am saving is NOT worth being jerked around and kept waiting every single delivery.",0.0
"What an awful experience! Is there such thing as negative 5 stars? This place is an absolute disaster and the food is even worse. Something tells me that some of the dumpsters on Atlantic Avenue were pillaged tonight, so that the chef could fill the void in his prix fix meal. I am seriously about to puke as I write this. We arrived to discover a prix fixe menu only. The amuse-bouche never arrived, although every other table received theirs at random intervals. When we pointed this out to the manager, we were basically ignored, until it arrived sometime right before our entrees (and after our first course). That really wasn't the bizarre part. I could have lived with that. This is where it gets totally weird. The prix fix menu listed filet mignon as a main, which makes sense- french restaurant, I get that. The waiter advised us that they were out of filet mignon, but had hanger steak instead. Fine, bring on the hanger steak. I notice everyone around me is eating that so I figure it's probably good. Well, here is the strange part...they are out of the filet, yet somehow it arrives on my plate ice cold and slathered with dijon mustard. I look around, no one else seems to have received this entree. After that, everything went totally downhill. My husband and I both sent our entrees back on account of them being cold. When they came back out again, they were still cold and I had received a different cut of meat which I couldn't even eat. I am sick to my stomach still thinking about what kind of meat it could have possibly been. It was neither hanger steak or filet. It was the texture of leather and covered with gristle and mustard. Chipmunk maybe? We were then informed that they were out of the dessert on the prix fixe menu and received 3 desserts, each one of which was worse than the next (the chocolate mousse was the consistency of tar and when I put my spoon in it, the entire glass of mousse came up with the spoon )and some cheap champagne to accompany them. During this whole ordeal, we heard from the manager not even once and even the woman who had only worked there for a month and half felt the need to come over and apologize. Bottom line, even if there are no other restaurants open in Brooklyn, don't come here. Take the subway, get out of dodge, just get farthest the f#$k way from this restaurant that you can, or buy your worst enemy a gift card for here.. BLEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH",0.0
"I have been very keen to try Laotian food because I've never had it before.  Although we initially made a booking for dinner, my son got sick so we decided to just take out and eat in.  The food took out very well.

The bartender who took our order was extremely knowledgeable so after discussing our options, we ordered:

Crunchy coconut rice with spicy lime leaf sausage - this is a lettuce wrap appetizer with the crunchy and flavorful coconut rice ball and a thin slice of sausage as the main components to be wrapped.  It was VERY tasty but wished that the sausage was bigger and the coconut rice ball smaller.

Ginger quail with a side of gailan (Chinese broccoli) - OMG, this was so tasty and completely de-boned save the little drumstick on both sides.  For some reason, it tasted like a more refined and less gamey pigeon.  It was perfectly seasoned with a sweet ginger marinade.

Prawns in curry sauce with Texas bread to sop up the curry sauce.  The prawns were excellent, but I didn't particularly care for the Texas bread which was a bit too chewy.

Although free if eating in, I did have to pay for the sticky rice which you ball up and dip into the Bang Bang sauce (so flavor but spicy that my tongue burned for a good 20 minutes afterwards) and charred eggplant.

The flavors at this restaurant did not apologize with its strong spicing because it was totally on the mark.  I sometimes wished that there were more Thai places like this that are not afraid to go for the full flavor.  They did not tone down for the Western palate and despite my burning tongue, I really appreciated the taste of everything.

My one advice is to order more protein because the meal had too many carbs as we ordered it.  This, hands down, beat Uncle Boons for me on this trip which frankly was very disappointing the second time around.",0.0

I can recommend the food, but you have to take into account that if the staff thinks you're not American, you will be discriminated when the bill comes in. I gasped at the total and on inspection I found that they were so kind as to add 20% tip. Really? Even in Soho I have never seen something like that! When we confronted the overall nice waiter, he said that 20% mark up is normal when you spend over $ 150. Our total was less than $150 BEFORE tip. Guys, really. I can see that you are sick and tired of tourists that don't tip, but there are nicer ways to make your point. Other than that, in a city with over 180 different nationalities you might run into a local that speaks a different language than English. Btw our American neighbors who spent the same amount, we're not charged a tip on their bill.",0.0
After passing this place countless times I decided to give them a try since they are close to home and I usually drive across town for my Hispanic food. Walked in and saw that none of the gentlemen serving the food were wearing gloves and one of them was taking cash payments. With that I walked out.

"I have been a Plated customer for a while now, and it has not been without downright frustration. This company can not seem to get the actual delivery to your house! Yet, they're happy to keep taking your money. 

1. Not Getting The Box to Your Home

This company has a serious problem with actually delivering the product they're selling. 
I've ordered a multitude of times, and maybe 1-2 boxes were received without incident. 
Today, I was expecting my box with (6) plates in it to have for dinner this week. 
Once again, not delivered correctly, even after having delivery instructions printed on the box!

2. Worthless Customer Service 

This company provides very poor (if any) customer service to it's customers (victims). 
I call to inform them that my food was not delivered correctly and of course, they're CLOSED. 
No help whatsoever, who knows where my PERISHABLE meals are!


3. Absolutely NO REFUNDS 

The many times I've had to call due to a missing box, just ends up as a ""credit"". 
If you want to get a refund, think again. They will only offer a credit to your account. 
So let me get this right..you can't even use that credit since they can't deliver you food in the first place. The only reason I ordered again was to use up that credit. I'm sure when they deicide to open tomorrow all I will get tomorrow is a useless, worthless credit. Boy, will they be sick of me after that call. 


4. They seem to think eating un-refrigerated food after 72-hours is okay and legal. 

The times they found out where the heck the shipment was they would tell me it was okay to eat as they have ""ice packs"" and ""insulation"" in the box. WRONG! I would never consume unrefrigerated meats and seafood after sitting who knows where for three days + . 


I'm DONE with Plated and will get a refund! I will call my CC company and file a complaint with the BBB. Plated is not who you want to spend your money with, I assure you. 

I will be trying Blue Apron and Hello Fresh and will leave a Yelp for them after I try their service.

"Another great craft beer bar, with excellent food. Dogfish Head 90 on tap, wha wha?! If I lived in the city, this would be my spot. The decor here is sick. Old school bar vibe, classy too! They offer up a great selection of craft beers, but I'd love to see more to be honest. Like all the craft beer bars in the area, they rotate the beers. But I think they have a few that are regular year round. The food...AWESOME! I'm getting hungry just thinking about the short rib sliders, sweet potato fries and brussel sprouts. Every time I've gone it's been pretty packed at the bar. But service at the tables was stellar. Our waiter was on top of his game. Never had an empty plate on the table long, and beers kept coming as soon as my glass was empty. I'll definitely be back again.",0.0

"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with our meal here. The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. We ordered the chicken parm plate which came with a choice of soup and a large portion of steamed veggies! I agree with some of the other reviewers - the chicken soup is delicious, exactly what I think of when I think chicken soup. My husband joked that we should get the soup here for each other when the other gets sick. The steamed veggies were simple, seasoned with salt, pepper and olive oil, but steamed perfectly and tasted delicious. My husband got the frutti de mari with linguine. The sauce was delicious, but the mussels and clams were mostly hollow and the calamari was chewy, but the shrimp were plentiful and delicious. With all that food + tax & tip, the total was only $37 - a value for the location and amount and quality of food! I think the current name of the place is Biu Bella and there is another entry for it on Yelp. It's a little confusing because the name of the place has changed a few times, but has always been some variation of similar words.",0.0

"I've only gotten delivery from here twice, and have had different experiences each time. On both occasions, the delivery was fast.

The first time, I ordered the crab cake, which was pretty good.  Although it was cakey, it still tasted good. I also ordered the fried pickles, which I loved. The seasoning was great, and they were perfectly cooked. After a while though, the seasoning did get a bit overwhelming.  I also got the Smoked Bacon Tater Tots with cheese sauce, which were really flavorful and crispy.   They were in the shape of Tetris pieces, which I thought was fun. Also, I got the marshmallow yams which tasted great and were really sweet and creamy.

The second time, I ordered the fried pickles and tater tots again.  This time, I wasn't so happy with the fried pickles. They were really greasy and the seasoning tasted different.  After a few pickles, there seemed to be a weird flavor that made me feel sick.  The tater tots came out great again, but the cheese sauce was cold by the time we received it. 

Overall, I wouldn't order delivery again from here, but would consider dining in and trying all these foods fresh.",0.0
"I really wish I wasn't sick and congested when I came here. But even with muted senses, their bucket of fried chicken was pretty damn good. Corn bread was unexpectedly glorious. LOVE the decor, the openness of the restaurant, the open kitchen where you can sit at the bar and talk to the chefs.

Case in pt...any type of specialty or something added esp. related to common food allergies such as nuts & dairy should be stated. So when the person orders and gets sick who is at fault esp when it was NOT Specified nor stated somewhere on the menu....

I ordered the California Rolls and never in my life have I received or ate sushi which in fact includes sesame seeds. This is not common. Then when I explain the issue to the idiot server (clearly not legal) she undermines what I'm saying and downplays it like she is right. WRONG. Lady, your NOT that bright. Then as I speak to the manager or whoever he was HE WAS RUDE. It got so awkward my friends and I were uncomfortable ordering add'l food.

"I'm in Miami, placed an order for soup for my sick baby in NYC, and received a text that the $60 delivery was placed. When I later found out the delivery wasn't received, I called restaurant and offered to pay additional for another delivery. The only option I was given after so much time on the phone, was to pay for another order with a 10% discount. 

When I explained that charging someone almost $60, full price, for something they never received is fraud, the Seamless employee told me I had received an email notification, and basically, too bad. I had no idea I had to watch my emails. I specifically left my cell phone number, which received a message that order was delivered. I have placed weekly orders for almost a year, without Seamless, and have never had a problem.

This time ""Seamless"" was the middle man. This time the Deli, and the Delivery man, had no accountability. Usually the delivery man called, and resolved issues directly.

"One of the neighborhood landmarks for me -and I have been here for some time. Inwood is changing so fast and I hope Broadyke does not become a casualty of gentrification.  

Over the years I bought every kind of meat imaginable from them and was never disappointed. Ask any question and they are happy to answer even give some recipe tips along. This is definitely the place to go for meat in Inwood.

That being said what makes Broadyke very special is the prepared foods they have. I know Bob -the owner- makes them himself and they are excellent. Soups, meatballs, lasagna they are all at the level of fancy restaurants in the city. If you are fed up with au-bon-pan soups, get your soup here next time and remember how a homemade soup is supposed to taste like. Also if you are sick and tired of Boar's Head cold cuts that invaded New York, try the homemade roast beef and turkey breast on a roll and again you will remember how good cold cuts can be. 

They also have some baked goods like corn muffins or cookies but those are your average deli baked goods. Not bad but nothing special.

He had the eggs with sweet potato fries. The waitress brought back the wrong order I received the regular eggs and non organic bacon His order was right but served on a chipped dish. I aske another waitress if my order was Paleo and she said no and took the plate. I was giving some of the same eggs with bits of bacon and melted cheese severed on sick looking toast. We will never eat from this place again. Don't know if you are really getting the grass fed and organic food you ordered. Also called the restaurant to complain and was on the phone waiting 25 minutes and then they diconnected.,0.0
"Shadiest sushi experience ever. I should have run when I saw the fish at the sushi counter: not much variety to begin with, and what little they had looked far from fresh - and as I would learn soon, tasted far from fresh. Restaurant itself had a vibe that made my local Chinese takeaway spots look luxurious. Counting my blessings I did not get sick from that dinner.",0.0
"cute place sweet owners, great potato with caviar yum!  but i have to say rude staff! the guy behind the bar was not interested in serving us and the guy who bought out my potato literally shouted ""you?"" at me when he came outside, he then leaned over the table and made a snotty/ snorty loud nasal sound that actually made me feel sick, i couldnt eat the potato for about 20 mins, really bad manners. i would hate for this lovely guys business to fail because of the rude behaviour of his staff, if youre reading this have a word with them, its the only let down",0.0
"Simple, cheap, quick and friendly. This is one of my go-to places. They are constant and delicious. I always order their chicken taco soup when I am sick. When I want to be healthier I get their burrito with black beans, shrimp and I add spinach. Sometimes I get the chicken asada ""Mexican pizza"" which is like a jumbo quesadilla. My husband gets the tacos.",0.0
"Two words: CAKE BALLS. One word to describe them: BALLLLS!! 

Stumbled on the Essex Market on a brief visit to NYC on the LES. Walking through the market I noticed the most awesome display of the cutest little colorful cake balls... CAKE BALLS??! What are these pretty little things I ask?? Nevermind.. don't tell me, just give me some! Dense and moist, I'd say a cross between cake and brownie consistency inside, chocolate or other flavored coating on the outside. I tried a variety of flavors - all super delicious. Flavors are very natural and true with actual fruit and/or booze in them. Not sickeningly sweet like they look -- which is very dangerous because you can eat a dozen and not be sick :)

I went back twice for my fill of cake balls and also got some for the plane ride home. 

CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE BALL?!?!! JUST KILL ME.... THE BESSSTTTT!!!

Ok these guys are a little flamboyant just so you know what to expect but they are cool and I will definitely be going back to try their other stuff next time I am in town!!",0.0
Unlimited fresh sushi for a decent price. I've eaten here over 5 times. Each time ordering plenty of raw fish and never did I get sick. They can use a few more waiters when it gets busy. Other then that this is a great spot in Bay Bridge to fulfill your sushi craving.,0.0
"MY LIKES: 

Kani salad: small, but lots of tempura flakes for that extra crunchiness. The mayo was very well mixed with the salad. Lots of crabmeat too

Spicy sashimi pizza: eight pieces. not an actual pizza, just an imitation of its appearances

Shrimp tempura roll: big shrimps

Fried oysters roll: mayo does not overpower the taste

Spider roll: mayo does not overpower the taste

Green tea tempura ice cream: ice cream was soft and fresh, with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle, finally topped with a cherry

THE OKAYS:

Miso soup: just the right amount of salt, but low on the seaweed

Salmon teriyaki bento box: it was good, but there were only three small pieces of salmon. I ordered the salmon bento box for the salmon, um??

Sake roll: big salmon, but the quality is mediocre

MY DISLIKES:

Green salad: just a bunch of lettuce put together with some mayo sauce and BAM , tenzan calls that a salad!

Chicken teriyaki: chicken was not cook thoroughly, thank god I did not get sick",0.0
I was feeling sick and needed something hot. I just came to this place because it was the closest soup to where i live. The restaurant stinks a majority of the time. It would benefit if they do anything different with the dumped out soup remnants that greet you when walk in. However my soup was good. Chicken pho with pork... good cuts of pork. Would order to go next time.,0.0
"I've been here twice and ordered matzo ball soup when I was sick and can vouch for its legitimacy as a real diner with lots of seating and many menu options. As with most diners it is best to stick with basics. I recently had an egg and cheese sandwich with bacon. Can't go wrong. G ordered the corned beef hash with eggs and potatoes which was tasy and huge. I helped him finish it off. It has a small parking lot which is a plus. Service is decent. In a neighborhood full of ethnic options, this will help you out if you need American staples like meatloaf and apple pie.",0.0

Loved it here! Everything my date and I ordered was fresh and just delicious! Get the hummus, baba, and the peppers with that awesome aioli.

Saiguette consistently delievered on quality food and no overly inflated niceties on service. Just straight up very good Vietnamese sandwiches for pick up.

"The cheapest, tastiest dumplings in Chinatown. For the longest time, they sold 5 dumplings for a dollar, even when Vanessa's nearby sold then at 4 for $1.25. Just recently, Prosperity bumped it up to 4 for a dollar. They're very tasty and often fresh, because this tiny, cramped hole in the wall is often packed. You'll get your food fast, though. Also, the hot and sour soup is a little too watery for my taste, but it's still good. My biggest qualm is that the dumplings, while tasty, are extremely oily. You can't eat here everyday without starting to feel a little sick (I've tried). During the winter, I remember seeing the puddle of oil on my small take-out box literally start coagulating every time a cold breeze blew in from the door opening and closing. Though I still swear by this place despite all that, since it's so tasty.",0.0
"Average 2 star review?! Man. Wow. Ain't that bad.  Come on, who reads Yelp anyways to pick a drug store. They're all kind of the same anyways!

I go several times per week. Come on though, it's a pharmacy so why would people take the time to write a review if they're happy. Unless they're obsessed Yelpers like me. 

Staff are usually quite nice, but they change every few months anyways. As for prescriptions I've had many good encounters. The female pharmacist with the southern drawl can be especially nice and funny sometimes. Lauren? 

Only had one bad encounter, they said my prescription would take 2 days and couldn't suggest another location that could do it quicker. They didn't give me another address or call them. Even after I stared at them awhile. I went to Union Sq, and they said it was fine since they're end of day cutoff was 10pm so I could have mine 12 noon next day. Would've been nice my local store helped me on this just a bit. I had to run around and call all myself. Oh well. Sucks when you're sick and gotta do that.

"This place took an hour to deliver my food. They didn't read my instructions.

"The only reason I give it one star is because I have to, otherwise it's a zero for me!  The food was absolutely horrible.  It looked old and bacteria-infested.  I basically ate the soups and lo mein.  There is no fast turnaround on the food.  There are empty bins and I was there one hour waiting for the crab legs to come out -- never did.  My check came out to $24.85 and I was horrified and  they actually added the tip into the total.  What's even sadder is the fact that the waitress was watching me take my money out hoping I would give her more of a tip.  Hell no!  I paid enough for nothing!

I then decided to visit the ladies room before I left and I walked out before even walking in.  It was so filthy, I actually gagged when I saw it (and smelled it).  If this is how clean they keep their bathroom, imagine what the kitchen looks like.  Do not go there unless you want to get salmonella and ecoli bacteria poisoning.",0.0
"Better food than service, I'll tell ya. I've heard stories of bad service from friends, but I actually got to experience it myself during a Saturday brunch rush. Still, it looked as though the waitstaff on duty consisted of two people, so I do show some sympathy.

My group of eight started to arrive for a friend's birthday brunch around noon, and the group trickled in until about 2:30 p.m. For Mamajuana's brunch, I guess it used to be $20 for AYCD and a buffet-style meal. I was expecting that, based on what my friends told me. I arrived to find a $25 AYCD (for 90 minutes) prix fixe brunch menu, so I didn't complain. Upon arriving at noon, we were all surprised to hear that half of the brunch menu was unavailable, despite the establishment being literally empty upon our arrival. Hmmmm. Those that wanted Chilaquiles or any type of Eggs Benedict meal was out of luck. The table was pretty evenly split between ordering steak & eggs or the French toast. I did go for the latter, served with dulce de leche, strawberries, and coconut. It was delicious, though the bread was a little bit under-cooked; as someone that can not consume raw eggs, it makes me a little nervous sometimes. Though I normally would not mind asking for it to be sent back, service was so lacking (as previously mentioned), that I just sucked it up and ate it. (Good news: I didn't get food poisoning. HUZZAH!) I also got a side of mangu with pickled onions which was damn near perfect. Those that went the steak & eggs route all enjoyed theirs. Later on, we got some complimentary birthday treats, complete with raging sparklers! Both the flan and the tres leches cake were top notch! 

Due to the lack of waitstaff, there were more cons than pros. I forget the name of our waiter, but to the gracious and funny bald gentleman with the sleeve tattoos, you accommodated us well despite the fact that you were one of two waiters we saw in the entire four and a half hours we were customers. I certainly don't blame you for the slow service, as you had a lot to do, so kudos to you, sir! I mean that sincerely. Of note, AYCD only lasts for 90 minutes, as I mentioned previously, but he started serving us at noon when the first of us arrived and didn't start the 90 minutes until 2:30 when the last guest finally arrived. Thank you again, sir! 

I'm on the fence about returning, though perhaps I'd give them another shot come the dinner hour one night...",0.0
"Wow. They give you A LOT of food. 

I went with 6 people and we ordered: garlic bread, calamari, rigatoni, chicken marsala. It was too much for us. 
Garlic bread: You have the option to add cheese or not. I think it's better with cheese. They give you 9 huge pieces of garlic bread. It's as big as a baby's face. I felt like I was eating cheese pizza. Their flavors are great though. 
Calamari: Crisp and tender. Their marinara sauce on the side is very good. I would recommend this dish for an appetizer.
Rigatoni: They give you a lot of pasta and a lot of meat. There's a variety of meat: sausage, pork tenderloin, meatballs, etc. 
Chicken Marsala: I thought it was slightly too salty but the chicken was very tender. 
Overall, there food was okay. It seems like it's homey Italian food, but the flavors weren't too great. I got sick of the food after a while and our group ended up not wanting to take any leftovers back home. 

Their appetizers are NOT smaller than the entrees. The appetizers are meant to be shared by the same number of people so please do not make a mistake of ordering more appetizers thinking that 2 appetizer = 1 entree, which is what we did. **1 appetizer = 1 entree. SAME PORTIONS (even salads).**
I would recommend you to order food that comes down to $16-17 per person. 

*You should come with at least group of 4-5. Do not come with groups less than 3 if you are not a huge eater unless you don't mind eating 1 dish or taking leftovers. 

Their service is slow because the restaurant is huge and it's usually packed. It was hard to get our server.",0.0
"There is a lot German Heavy Metal in the world. German food goes well with beer, so why not connect the metal with the food and with the beer. That is essentially what this place did for this hole in the wall. The inside looks kind of like a beer garden, but it is way darker and there is no outside area that I noticed at least. 

The music was heavy metal... at first they were playing a combination of Iron Maiden, Twisted Sister, Danzig, and the Scorpions, but after hearing the Scorpions, I think they got sick of that and switched over to brutal and grinding death metal. 

They had a pretty good German beer selection, one that was a step above the typical German beer selection in that there was a veritable attempt to get some of the more obscure (at least for the US or NY) brands (i.e., they didn't just have Erdinger, Warsteiner, and Ayinger). There were also a couple of NYC microbrews on tap. The prices for the beer, especially in the bottles was a little on the high side, but I guess that is how you make the money. 

The food was also pretty good. We had a grilled cheese, pretzel, and the salami plate. The salami was by far the best thing; however, the pretzel was certainly respectable. The grilled cheese was OK, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. 

If you want to get beer in a boot, you can do that too... I didn't want to do that, so I didn't.",0.0

"I was in the area Monday night and was in the mood for sushi. This place seemed to have very good reviews, so I figured why not?

Food-

The sushi was decent.  Each roll averages about $3. You get nicely sized and seemingly well-prepared rolls. I had the Eel Avocado but Spicy Tuna was better. Ok so why the 2 stars? Read on..

Jeez, this placed looked dirty! Someone mentioned it in a previous review and I should've listened. They try to keep the place tidy, but as a person who values cleanliness, I was not happy. The walls look stained, the corners of the floors looked sticky and clumpy as if they haven't been mopped in months. Take a look at the fire extinguisher on the floor by the kitchen, it's disgusting! The booths were dirty and the place smelled moldy! It was a weird stench but I recognized it as soon as I walked in, almost like an old abandoned mildew-filled home.  If a place doesn't put effort into making their establishment spotless, can you imagine how they handle your food behind closed doors? Especially Sushi which requires a lot more TLC. 

The ambiance was completely dead and they don't even have background music. This place needs severe renovation. The servers were forgettable and did not go out of their way to be friendly. Yes, the sushi itself was decent. Yes, I was hungry. Yes, I worried about food poisoning. Yes, I'm ashamed I ate there.. but what's a girl to do? Yes, I will NOT eat there again! 

I would've given it 1 star but bc the sushi itself was pretty good and I didn't die of food poisoning, I gave it 2. That's good right?",0.0

Also ordered the strawberry whipped cream waffle, which was also over five dollars for tiny waffle, a ton of melting whip cream and 1 yes just 1 strawberry on top of the waffle. Not worth it, what a waste. It is to expensive and not appetizing. Also the staff put gloves on, but then touch everything with those gloves then they go back and touch your food with the same gloves. I saw that on my last visit as well.

"Come here for dinner often - my husband loves it.

Ok food. Super casual, fun, young atmosphere, big place, can usually get a table without waiting too long. Good for a crowd. Have had big parties here for 12+ (with reservation). Service is good. Love getting a table outside when the weather is good and people watching. Brunch is good too - usually a wait at peak brunch times.

Always start with guac and chips - standard but tasty.

Fish tacos are great - the fish is crispy and flakey on the inside. Good flavor and pairs well with the cabbage and mayo-type sauce. The pineapple salsa is BOMB however I have a feeling it's from canned pineapple (thumbs down)

Brisket tacos are ok - a little too drenched in BBQ sauce for my liking, but whatever floats your brisket boat. The creamy corn tastes canned but is fine.

Smoked Brisket entrée leaves something to be desired. Big slab of brisket that is drenched in sauce on the outside and dry on the inside. The jalapeño goat cheese cornbread is bad. Tastes premade and the flavors don't compliment each other at all.

Husband always orders the Crispy Chicken Torta and sings its praises. It's a fried chicken cutlet sandwich - nothing to write home about. It's good, if you are craving one, but besides that it's fine.

The fried ice cream is too much for even 2 gluttons like us to eat. It's ok- a little too oily. I've had much better fried ice cream. My heart breaks leaving it half uneaten, but it always brings me to the brink of being sick from over eating. MAYBE 4 people can finish it.

I will return. It's fun for date night, I like guac, and my husband likes the chicken torta. That's about it though.",0.0

"I came here on a rainy Sunday to get out of the rain and do some work, and because all the Starbucks stores I passed were full.  I decided Pret would work just fine....  I just got an iced coffee with caramel and an almond croissant.  The croissant was good, I enjoyed it.  The coffee though, reminded me vaguely of some medicine I had to take when I was sick as a child mixed with sterile bandages.  Literally there was no resemblance to coffee flavor.  I've had better tasting coffee from cheap motel rooms.  I could not finish it.  Also, they have ONE single outlet in the seating area, and its behind the trash, so you have to pull the trash away from the wall to get to it, and have to sit right next to it.  That is some seriously poor eatery setup.

My favorite thing to get here is their peanut butter acai bowl. I think I could pretty much live off of these things- I can't even tell you how many I have probably consumed....It's pure heaven in a bowl. Their pre-made food items are usually delicious, but kind of pricey for the portion size! A lot of their baked goods (in front of the cash register) are hit or miss for me, but most of them are vegan and/or gluten-free if you're into that sort of thing. 

It can take a while to get smoothies as there's usually a line and only 2-3 people making them at once. BUT it's definitely worth it. Really great customer service too.

"THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER

My company party was last night - in the Toshi ""Penthouse"".  We booked the space due to the magnificent view of the Empire State Building from the rooftop terrace.  This was THE reason we booked this space.  There is nothing spectacular about the indoor space. And there is no view of the Empire State Building from inside the space.  We arrived (all 60+ guests) to find that the roof access was locked, the windows were covered, and no one could explain how or why this had happened.  The manager who we worked with to book the party was not on site for our event, nor did he answer his phone or respond to the multiple texts or emails that I sent throughout the night.  The party was a complete disaster-- from inadequate service, non-existent security personnel (which we paid for), poor food, lack of any sort of customer service, and most importantly -- the room was very hot & overcrowded due to the ROOF not being accessible.  

I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed and humiliated I was as the office party planner and being put in the position of letting down all my guests, staff, CEO and President of my company.  

I have been in event planning for the past 15 years and this was by far the WORST experience of my corporate life.  They did not deliver anything that was contracted and promised.  I actually feel sick about it.

This venue could not even get a beer/wine bar right.  How hard is it to provide beer and wine?  Would you expect there to ONLY be one choice of beer for your guests?  Seriously.... One choice.  Blue Moon.  Take it or leave it.  

Do yourself a favor--and DO NOT book an event here.  I had actually read negative comments in Yelp about this space-- and confronted management about it.  I was assured that the organization was under *new* management and that the issues of the past would not occur.   The negative reviews were 100% spot on.

A taste of the chefs offerings! 

The meal was so rushed that even after requests to have a pause between meals was ignored. My fiancés plate was always cleared before mine. I find that very rude. As soon as I laid my cutlery the plate was taken and another was served in seconds. There was no time to enjoy.

The food was below average. The appetiser was two calzones that were not balanced in flavour. The mozzarella was lovely. The next course we had chosen one of each and the rabbit ragu was amazing, the broccoli and almond was disgusting. For the main meals we also chose one of each and the lamb was divine but very salty. The lobster tail bisque was not right and I am wondering if I will be sick.

Hair nets are a thing, but these weren't necessarily head hairs, so... It's just gross! People can get sick like that.",0.0

"Got to try this place after reading the mixed reviews and I must say, my experience was wonderful. I went on a Monday around 830 and it wasn't crowded but had a nice amount of customers. I like the fact they give you your own personal pot as sometimes people are sick especially in the winter and I don't really feel like sharing my pot with you sick folks. The waitress was nice, service was pretty attentive, they came often to refill my pot. The portions were good. The premium beef wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The fatty beef & pork belly were amazing, & quail eggs! I love quail eggs. Their Fuzhou fish balls were amazing. 

Yeah overall I had a great time and will be coming back! I usually go to baidu but this place is cheaper and even has a Korean BBQ option!",0.0
"This is a nice enough spot. It's right smack in the middle of NYU, so keep that in mind if you decide to hangout here in adulthood.

I went with a large group of - I'll just call us ""post grads"" - on a Saturday night for a birthday party. The staff was very accommodating with a large reserved area right up front. They were also attentive, without being pushy. It was very comfortable.

After pushing through the crowd of hormones, the bartenders were also extremely accommodating. I had been sick, and in the throes of an early-Saturday night rush they made me not one, but TWO hot toddies without hesitation - and they were delicious... and HUGE.

I probably won't return without call for an occasion just because I'm a little out of the demographic. But if you're young and single (guarantee you everyone had Tinder there), it's worth a drink or three.",0.0

"If i could give 0 stars I would!! I am HIGHLY disappointed by the extremely horrible customer service I received from this store, starting with the crew all the way to the manager (Luis). I waited over 2 hours for my food, and never got it, when I called the store I was put on hold several times & even hung up on twice. Luis eventually told me they called & the phone was disconnected. I clearly put a different number for them to call in the instructions& they disregarded it completely. I am a frequent customer of dominos and after this incident, I don't feel like I am valued as a paying, loyal customer. It's ridiculous how long I waited, and how long I was put on hold. I always go to the location on 167 & jerome ave & the service is great.

"PEPPER SPRAY BOMBS AT THE PERK OF THE NIGHT thrown within closed doors to control a fight amongst two men which took place three feet away from the entrance? Really? If your two bouncers who hustle people at the door to get in would be more honest, trained and EFFICIENT, you would not lose out on so much business ending your night early since you made all your customers sick to their stomachs. They seriously could hustle even women at the door to get in, but AGAIN, can not stop a fight which was right by the door? JESUS!! Thank those bouncers for also ruining not only your image, but your future business as well. Even larger places can control a fight without having to cause your customer to almost pass out let alone catch asthma attacks. Did you guys really think that was smart? You think two men needed to cause all that or did your bouncers know the men and knew they were armed? Since that's the explanation he gave the police well they questioned why they took those actions to resolve a fight. Lets be serious! You may want to hire real security not only for the safety of your guest, but also for your own sake.

"One of the best places to eat on the Long Island city waterfront. I've eaten here two times so far and do not know why this is my first time reviewing it. The design of this place on the inside is sick. They put a lot of time and money into many details of this place. The location alone would render any restaurant a success, however, this place will only gain more and more followers and regular customers. 

The drinks are so on point that I don't mind waiting for a table if necessary. Even a classic vesper martini is perfect. 

The food is sooooo tasty. I'm a foodie and like to talk bad about things when they are bad and good when they are good. This place will becomes staple in this waterfront district of LIC. The fish the meat the pasta, all fresh, all tasty. The bread and the spread they give you in the beginning is an orgy of flavored in your mouth. The octopus is very very tender. When I asked them why it's so tender, they responded that they beat the hell out of it and then lovingly massage it. 

I always finish my meal with espresso. Unlike most Italian restaurants in the city that end up giving me the most bitter of espressos, the coffee here is fantastic and a great finish to my meal. I have not tried many deserts, I'll write a special desert review at a later date.",0.0

The amount of food is sufficient for me; if someone is saying it's so little: well, it's not the typical American restaurant where they stuff you with carbs and sugar only so you feel you can't even move after. It's good stuff here, good quality ingredients that leave you full but not sick.

But I am more than happy to put this establishment on blast here for their piss poor customer service. I work in the vicinity and have only gone here for breakfast. There is one particular employee I have dealt with that has on numerous occasions refused to put something as simple as ketchup on my order despite having asked repeatedly for ketchup, before the order and even after the first refusal. His assinine logic is that I can get the ketchup packs when I pay. You have that bottle with ketchup right next to you for a purpose and in the time it takes you to explain the wonders of trying to open dumb ketchup packets just comply with a customer's request and send the customer away content. Why this establishment keeps this worker is beyond me. I let the Korean owner have it in our language asking him how he allows this level of sub-standard behavior persist when a customer asked for something so basic. The fact that this wasn't the first time finally contributed to my outburst. Even if they laid out a red velvet carpet I have learned my lesson.

You get sat and your order is put in and things just get rolling, which is a wonderful thing when you are tired of walking around Times Square and are hungry and thirsty!

As for food, start with the wings, trust me, you won't regret it. The sauce they have is just a perfect balance of spicy and smokey bbq. They are giant wings, most definitely genetically modified, but worth the GMO poisoning, because they will fill you up. This is a giant portion, so bring friends to share with. I also love their ribs, they are nice and moist and fall off the bone. So if you are hungry, definitely get a full rack and take half home for later. 

Finally, with all this finger licking good food, you will want some drinks! The best thing about Dallas BBQ is really the drinks. They are nice and strong, so don't expect a girl margarita when you come here. Yes, get a Texas size, and yes get that extra shot of patron if you've had a rough week. 

The best part of this whole thing is the price! You get quality food and drinks for a decent price, especially in comparison to any of the other places in times square. You can pay $10 for 2 burnt shish kabobs with mystery meat or get a full plate of food here at BBQ's. So tourists, choose wisely.",0.0

"SoCo is sooo good! Besides the fact that its name reminds me of Southern Comfort, their food is excellent and their staff is pretty great as well. Not to mention it is within walking distance of my apartment, you cannot beat that. 

Now my friend and I had been dying to check this place out for a solid month before we actually were able to; she was sick, I had to work a lot, etc etc. So we were very excited that on a damp Wednesday afternoon our dreams about SoCo finally became true. It did take a bit of time for us to be seated; no one was really aroun. When we finally got someone's attention we were seated. They had a wine special that evening; everybody gets to sample a free glass of wine, now that's awesome. I don't think I have ever been to a place where they did that. I ordered the salmon burger, it was unbelievable, cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles that was on a red velvet waffle. I tried a bit it was so sweet and delicious in every way. Dare I say it; they were the best chicken and waffles I have ever tasted. 

When we were ready to leave again it took us awhile to get someone's attention so we could get our check. Overall it was a pretty excellent experience and the food was great. If you are craving some southern food this is a place to really consider.",0.0
"Even though it says 5 napkin burger, my burger wasn't nice and messy and juicy. That is saying something because even though I ordered med done it was pretty rare. It should have been really juicy. I got the blue onion burger. The onions were supposed to be carmelized but I think they just threw a bunch of sugar on top of them while cooking them so they were this sick sweet mess. Not rich and deep brown like they are suppose to be. Yucky. My friend got the shrimp po boy which only had a few shrimp on it. Not that great. But, they do have an interesting menu so it might be worth giving it another try. And, they do not have good coffee. Pick one of their great beers from a nice list that they have on the table.",0.0

Ha, very interesting that a restaurant had no way of transporting a small liquid to go. My sick girlfriend ordered food and a green tea to-go. She wanted some honey and I asked for a plastic ramekin to put the honey in. He smuggly told me that they don't have those. Not that they had run out, but just simply that they don't use them, with a super douche smile like it was cool. He wasn't even busy! I promise that if I went behind that bar or to-go station, I'd find a stack of plastic ramekins, just like they have ice and silverware, it's a restaurant staple. I was furious and will never go back. It's about principle and there are a million restaurants in NYC, I don't need to give my money to consistently rude jerks.

"Worst steak house in NYC!
BAD attitude of wait staff.

Caesar salad was bland with mayo not dressing.
Bread was terrible white bread, doughy. No real butter, just fake spread.
Creamed spinach tasted like frozen chopped spinach, no flavor, no cream.
The mashed potatoes were bland.

The steak was RAW, ordered medium. The waiters were so rude, argued.
Thi and Temple were the rudest New York waiters I have ever encountered.
They should be sent back to the Midwest rocks from which they crawled.

"DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. This place has a great atmosphere and I could see it being great for people without allergies. 

Yet I have food allergies and I did not have a good experience: it took the food four times to come back correctly and not once did the waitress apologize or a manager come over to apologize or acknowledge the situation. And i got still sick, even after the 45 minute delay. I have been a server for eight years, and understand how this could be an off-day for a restaurant. I just wouldn't recommend this for anyone who has an allergy to anything.",0.0
"IF YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES OR INTOLERANCES DO NOT COME HERE.I am never one to give a bad review or act In spite but I have to share the horrible experience I had here. I called ahead twice before coming to make sure they could accommodate my food allergies which they assured me it wouldn't be a problem, ok cool. So, Giving this place the benefit of the doubt I looked cute with greeney and front patio seating but when we went inside, it was really dark, (I have 23 year old eyes and had to hold my Plates and menu up to the candles to see)I have a number of food allergies (gluten dairy soy nuts) and talked to the hostess and waitress about it again just to make sure. the waitress said there were GF items marked on the menu, ok cool but when I mentioned my other issues she looked overwhelmed and confused and made me feel like a crazy person with outlandish requests. I tried to talk to the kitchen myself and the waitress practically pushed me away from them. Ok...She was the only waitress working the entire inside which was quite obvious as our food arrived over an hour after we ordered. I ordered the tacos which she said would be made to my specifications and yet She served me flour tortillas and told me I would be fine. Luckily I held up the flashlight on my phone to notice the difference between a flour and corn tortilla. I could have been rushed to the hospital had I eaten what she told me was safe! After I told her this was a flour tortilla she rolled her eyes and tried to tell me I was wrong then eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and brought out corn tortilla tacos. She told me this was fine now. I ate them cause they looked pretty plain (Aka basically Lettuce with a side of tortilla) and felt sick after eating them. Had to leave my group before the check came and take a cab home. All the waitress said was that my tacos were taken off the bill, wow, what a gesture there was zero remorse. She was so rude! Horrible service , never coming here again!",0.0
"Unfortunately, the number of 5-star reviews on Yelp is a bit misleading. 

I am allergic to gluten and consequently, my expectations for restaurant food are not sky-high. If I can eat something that is relatively tasty and does not make me sick, usually I am thrilled. 

The food here was some of the blandest, most tasteless food I've ever had in a restaurant, in any city. I sampled several dishes as we were here with a group and everything was bland, whether it was a pasta dish or some kind of meat entree. 

The service was equally problematic. We didn't get our food until maybe 90 minutes after ordering, despite the staff telling us several times that it was on the way. Once we pressed them for information on what was going on, they told us that they had cooked up all the dishes for our group except one, which they had forgotten, then decided (without asking what our preference would be - which is a bit surprising) it would be better to throw out the dishes they did cook and just re-cook everything...rather than just give the one person whose food was delayed a free appetizer or something to hold them over. 

We wound up spending close to three hours in here from start to finish, and we were sweating throughout because the place was way overheated. 

In their defense, they were apologetic and gave us free desserts. However, the final annoyance was that we had a decent size group and asked merely that they split the check two ways, which they refused to do. All service issues aside, the core issue is the food is surprisingly bland and tasteless.",0.0
"Went here on a hot but windy day, and loved it. The alcohol is reasonably priced. I ordered a hamburger, and while there was nothing special about it, it did taste good. One problem: if you're a girl with long hair, tie your hair up if you're going to eat anything (my hair was constantly flying into my mouth while trying to eat and it was not pleasant lol). 

Food: 3.5/5

"Delicious bao. This restaurant's namesake hits the mark. The bao skin is supple and silky yet durable enough to detach from the steamer and safely reach your spoon via a set of claw tongs. The filling and soup inside are delectable and keep you wanting more. The anticipation for the pay off as the bao makes its way to your spoon is palpable and reinforced as each bao successfully reaches home. IMHO crab was the best but ymmv.

Another standout, the hot and sour soup, portioned for about 4 small bowls. 

The chicken soup was good for a sick day but lacked depth and character.

Overall well worth the visit, will return for more bao!",0.0

"So I would have given this a good 4 stars if the service was even mediocre.
I'm a bare burger fanatic and never had a bad experience at a location before until today. My waiter was extremely inattentive,from simple things like water and sauces to giving us a death stare as we ordered which made it all the more uncomfortable. I ordered a burger and took a bite into it and a river of blood literally went down my throat and made me cringe. It wasn't even medium rare , I prefer a little rare but this was in bearable for me. I felt sick to my stomach and the brisket in it was pure raw fat that wasn't properly cooked. I asked my waiter to change it to be as well done as possible because I couldn't force feed myself that blood bath even if I wanted to. When I asked he just brought it over to the cook who wouldn't stop giving me dirty looks and practically hissing at me. All I did was nicely ask for a well done burger, that's disgusting that the cook had the audacity to stare me down consecutively like I murdered someone. The second time the burger was brought out it was okay, no more weird raw fat globs sticking out or pool of blood. It was good. I definitely will walk right out if I see the same waiter or chef again because they are terrible.",0.0

"Amazing service, views and urinals? Let the lovely staff of SixtyFive Bar treat yourself to a night that will leave  you penniless, but rich with experience.

Our first rounds were cocktails. There was a large variety and the bar tender can pretty much make up any you like. We were glad to see they were filled with ice, as we intended to make our drinks last as long as possible ( we like to think of it as efficient and savvy not stingy and poor) ... And we were about 1 m away from the sun. They were delicious! Expensive at US$25 but let's be honest, we are paying for the views, not the drinks. 

*Advice- it costs US$30 to go up to the observation deck at the Rockefeller Centre. Dress up fancy and get yourself a cocktail at SixtyFive and you're literally saving yourself five dollars, with a 100% better experience.*

Mitch ordered beers after that,reasonably priced. I ordered a vodka, lime and soda (trying to watch my thighs) but I was terrified to order it as the prices weren't on the menu, but other spirits have prices surpassing the hundred dollar mark... for one shot! I asked the waiter what the cheapest vodka was, and as his 2004 Oakley sunglasses suggested, he was cool about it.

Mitch- I ordered the fried potatoes, and was more than surprised with the large portion of fried goodness that came out. Fluffy potato,  crispy skin and a very salty seasoning. They came out with a white sauce that can only be described as shallow and pedantic... in all seriousness it was a truffle aolii, which offset the saltiness of the potato (which I believe are purposely salted so much to make me drink more... at least that's what I told Katie). Overall I was happy with them as a large snack, and nothing more.

Katie - I panicked ordered (definition: when you don't know what you want yet, but your partner has already ordered and the waiter is looking at you.) I ordered the spicy tuna roll. I saw the lovely Japanese man prepare it fresh, which is nice because I've had food poisoning from sushi three times in my life. It was quite a small portion, but I wasn't expecting too much from a fancy bar. It was delicious... And I consider myself somewhat of a sushi slut... I've tried a lot of sushi in my time and this sushi was at least top 3.

I ate it painfully slow, which is very unlike me; I resemble a vacuum cleaner when it comes to food, like a little leprechaun is going to come steal my food if I don't eat it that instant. Mitch's portion was large as well, so I didn't want to be tortured by watching him eat his potatoes after this fatty finished her sushi 20 minutes ago. (It happened anyway; And I ate a couple of his potatoes) the sushi tasted very fresh; the sesame seeds and rice falling apart, like fresh food should. There was also a very generous little bowl of soy sauce... I love me some soy sauce. For the small portion of sushi we paid US$16, but I must say it was worth every penny, it surpassed any other sushi I have paid $10 for in New York... And I didn't shit myself the next day, bonus!

Mitch- I would have bought a $300 whiskey shot to get the view from the men's bathroom. It was the highest and most glorious wee I have ever had ...since high school. It took every ounce of my being not to fill my pockets with free mints and sit in the shoeshine chair like King Henry the viii. It was basically a birds eye view of New York City and I bet the cocktail prices reflect the plumbing maintenance.

Overall our experience was what we envisioned New York to be like, and although it is very expensive, it was worth every penny and we 100% recommend it. As a once off whilst in the Big Apple, it is definitely our pick.",0.0

"TL;DR The Bomb, that is all.

I was straight bout to give this place a three star until I found out how cheap my brother got me The Bomb for.  WTF!! This humongous sandwich for that price?  I thought Gentrification (with a capital G) prices reached Astoria?  To give you an example I recently got a crap Turkey sandwich from some overpriced gentrifying signal sandwich shop in the Lower East side for over $11...it tasted like microwaved off brand deli turkey.

Now here's Sal, Kris, & Charlie giving me the Bomb for like $8 which can feed two mortally obese people for lunch.  

Do I know what was in the sandwich?  I don't know...some turkey, some ham, I think I saw some pastrami....probably some salami.  Pretty sure a rapper can make a track about the sandwich and it'll just be a list of deli meats (sorta like when Jay Z listed out a bunch of monsters on the Monster track).  The point is a group of 4 homeless people can pool their money together and get a pretty good meal out of it.  So if you're homeless right now and in Astoria, Sal, Kris, & Charlie's Deli is the place to be.  It's either here or Prosperity Dumpling in Chinatown for best value food in NYC.  I can't decide.  I'd probably still pick Prosperity Dumpling.

Also The Bomb really reveals how much sodium is in deli meats.  Not necessarily a good point...but it is for me cause it just means they were very generous with the meats.  It will give a health eater a headache after eating this, cause I was reaching for a 2 liter bottle of coke while scarfing down this salt bomb.  But the point is a person in poverty can have a filling meal.

I would also say they put too much of the sauce on the sandwich cause the meat would slip out (that's what she said...yea I pre-empted your sick mind).  Do I know what sauce it was?  Again, no...maybe thousand island, maybe chris's sauce?  who knows. There were times I just ate bread and sauce, and then would need a fork to eat the meat that fell out (god you have a dirty mind).  But the point is a pauper could get a good meal.    

Seriously...the point is a struggling New Yorker can get a filling meal for the cheap.",0.0

If it was noted anywhere or someone called me after i placed and paid for my order would be VERY helpful. 
The next day i stopped by to pick up my order and was told i need to pick it up at another location (not sure why). Didnt have time to go and called the ""other"" location later asking for delivery and they were too busy saying they can only deliver it the next day (!) 
At this point i had no other choice but cxl this order and call Liquiteria.

"This is my first time at this location and first review. As for the crowd we went on a sat yesterday night around 8pm and wasnt crowded at all by time we left at 9:30 it was nearly empty no line. The deals are great so much options. The deli section was small disappointing for such a large store. Not many combo too choose and what was offered like boars head turkey and swiss was $8. I can get that combo at Guinta Meat Frams or Compare for $5 on sale. I have to say the deli employee was professional & friendly. There were some items that were stamped with a good expiration date yet the item had mold on it. Probably causedby over crowding the section or case just not set at right temp. We entered to double doors to a warehouse of meat & frozen items. The selection again was grand. We were shopping with my children one whom is a 3 yr old. She needed to use the bathroom my husband took her he asked 1 employee if bathroom was dirty he replied ""alittle"". My husband was mortified walked in to toliets full of FECES. My husband frantically found a bottle of bleach and cleaned the seat himself he was left with no choice or my daughter feces would have been part of the mess. The fumes from bleach caused my daughter to have a headache and my husband whom suffers from high blood pressure skyrocketed so much he came out physically flushes red faced made a scene. The young woman manager said she knew it was like that and had no one to clean it. She said customers were complaining all day.

"I thought it would be an interesting birthday experience to take my bf to a bourbon distillery. Plus, they made chocolate there. So, win-win. 

I contacted management through their website to inquire how to go about reserving a spot for 2 for a tour. We decided to go the walk-in route, as that is what they offer on the weekend for $15 per person. I received a prompt response, and was told that they did not take reservations, to just walk-in and voila. 

Well, when we got there for the 2 pm tour, we were informed by the front desk staff member that because someone called in that day, they would not be offering tours. 

I wasn't rude (I hope), but I admit I did not hide my disappointment very well. Sienna, the only staff member present, was extremely understanding and helpful, and because it was a slow day up to that point, she offered to give us a one-on-one tour. I thought this was very gracious of her, as it was not her (or anyone's fault, really) that her co-worker called in sick. 

Shortly after we started the tour, it got busy (of course) but she made every effort to try and handle our tour and the walk-ins as personally and professionally as she could. We were grateful, and she really helped to save the day.

One of my favorite drinks when its cold out or when I'm sick is the lemon ginger tea, they put actual lemon in it and shaved ginger which is really great...some places just use flavoring so this surprised me.

"Came here for a brunch/lunch not really knowing what to expect from the mixed reviews. One plus is that being situated on 2nd and 51st it mos def adds to the neighborhood a place where you can get a not only affordable but tasty bite to eat.

I got the Sriracha burger, which was actually pretty good, even if the burger was cooked a little more than what I asked (that's a whole other story). Most notably though, is it's made with bacon wrapped friggn' onion rings! They had me at ""bacon."" Then to add to the depth of the sandwich they add avocados and an amazing aioli. My so got the breakfast burrito, which was decent. It has a ton of ingredients from chorizo to queso Oaxaca. Unfortunately it was just missing that little something to give it a balanced taste (salt heavy)... maybe citrus?

3 instead of 4 stars. Aside from the burrito, we really liked our experience, the ambience was quite nice since it's obviously a sports bar by night. The service was fast and pretty friendly. BUT, those god damn health code grades are a mind f*ck. They have a ""B,"" no biggy in my mind, especially since I have a sort of insight of how bullshit they can be especially for sushi place. Anyways, when I went to order my burger, I asked for it rare. I know, I'm one of those sick freaks who likes the taste of meat with a hint of blood, I'm a freak, I get it. The servers reaction to my request though made be feel like I was back in the midwest, where ordering something rare is akin to booking your own execution date. Anyways, after  placing my order, immediately regretting because of the grade in the window, I then asked to change the order to med-rare. Well, the kitchen evidently took that as, ""Oh this kid has never ordered a burger before and I don't want this piece of meat sent back sooo, BURN THAT BITCH!"" Needless to say, the burger came out medium, barley.

In short, highly recommend and order your burger how you want it the first go around.",0.0

"Ok, so I came here with my hubby to celebrate his friends bday. It was during the Mayweather/ Pacquiao fight and we ordered a bottle package that included three bottles and one bootleg champagne , it also included a platter of wings and French fries. We waited in line about an HOUR just to get in, paid 800 for a package to suit 8 ppl, once we got in we waited another half hour for someone to show us to our table/ seating area. Once we arrived to our ""table"" we saw that we had to share a long white couch that was DIRTY and it wasn't even enough room for us to all sit down so about five of us had to stand. We complained to the waitress and her response was ""sorry this is the best we have"" the tables weren't even cleaned off, they were wet and smelled of vomit. Due to many ppl having to stand up due to not enough seats in our so called ""VIP section"". My neck hurt watching the fight because it was hard to see the screen with so many ppl having to stand. Once the food arrived I can't believe I was even desperate enough to try the food in this place but some of the wings tasted slightly raw. The food overall just looked kind of thrown together. There was also a drunk guy squeezed incredibly close to us and he kept falling into us from another table (security no where to be found). I had to use the bathroom and I had held it for as long as I could so I eased my way through the crowd ( the floors were incredibly greasy and slippery) so I was really afraid I would break my neck trying to get through in heels. So I FINALLY made it to the bathroom and OMGAWWWWD.. This bathroom had wet toilet tissue all over the floor, no soap in the dispensers, toilet paper clogging the sinks, toilet paper not in the rolls in the stall and when I picked up a toilet paper roll it was sticky so I got so grossed out I dropped the roll & didn't use the bathroom.. I then made my way back across that dirty slippery ass floor and told my husband we we really need to leave. YUCK, YUCK, and mother f-ing YUCK!",0.0
"Bad, extremely slow service. Rude servers and bartenders. Bathrooms were a mess, no toilet paper and vomit. Food was blah and way overpriced, I could of had a better sandwich at subway. Sat for almost 30 mins before our waitress came. Waitress messed up order and had the nerve to charge us for an add on that wasn't even served. When we told her she wasn't apologetic and since we were already half way done we said we no longer wanted and her response was ""well technically your paying for it "" and then 15 mins later while trying to track her down for our check a busboy comes with a tiny container like what you serve ketchup in with the add on ingredient...

"THIS WAS THE WORST AND MOST UNPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE EVER. PERIOD. On Friday, July 23, I took two friends from out of town here for some ice cream. I ordered two scoops of ice cream from the girl at the counter... no big deal. We sat down and conversed for about 45 min or so when the manager asked us (politely) to move to another area because he was mopping... ok, no big deal. When we decided to leave, I needed to go into the bathroom. I asked the same manager who asked us to move to unlock the bathroom. He told me it was for customers only... to which i replied that i was.He proceeded to tell me that i was NOT a customer and refused to open the bathroom door. 

Now, I'm a pretty cool and level headed guy, so I reminded him that he had just asked us to relocate earlier. He still refused. I told him to check his camera... he replied ""we have no cameras."" He asked me who rang me out and i told him it was a girl (who had already left) and then he told me ""Well, I didn't check you out."" 

The NERVE. I am a repeat PAYING CUSTOMER. Finally, he relented and gave me the bathroom key... 

The bathroom was ATROCIOUS! Vomit in the corner, clogged toilet with toilet paper, urine splattered all over the walls and floors... I, too, almost vomited. 

Upon leaving, I approached the manager with the keys and told him how extremely unpleasant and unprofessional he was (in loud tones). I was thoroughly embarrassed in front of my friends. I told him I will be making a formal complaint, and he responded very nonchalantly. I forget his name, but he seemed to be of Indian descent. RUDE.",0.0

The street is a distance away. I tell him I have never had to do that, I have children and I am sick. I ask him to plz come up. He calls me back not even a minute later asking me what I want him to do with the order! I told him to take it back. I unfortunately made the huge mistake of paying with a card and had to call the store. They were rude! I was yelled at! I was called a LIAR and other derogatory names.

"Some people see this hole in the wall as a simple, cheap eatery that serves up cheap roasted meats over rice. I, on the other hand, see a life time of dedication and skill. 

The store front is pretty hard to miss. If it wasn't for the constant line that can stretch out the door and down the block, I would not have found it myself. Don't let that line discourage you; your patience will be rewarded. 

From dawn until dusk. this team of 2+ serves up some of the best roast pork and duck on this side of Chrystie Street. Just be patient: this couple takes their job - and - their domain seriously. ""She"" works the morning noodles, ""he"" works everything meaty from taking your order, to chopping your meat, to packing, the taking your payment. The most bang for your buck is the two roasted meats over rice (usually roast pork and duck for me) for $5. I also go for the roasted meats by the pound (extra ginger/garlic sauce please!) when I'm looking to stock up.

But of course, there are some opportunities here. One thing I'm not super excited about is the roast pig. It's only made in small batches and is rarely as crisp as I'd like it to be. And then there's the level of cleanliness that always makes me a little nervous. With only two in the front of the house, it is purely impossible for any cleaning to happen during the day. Fortunately I never got sick.

Come with some patience. Just don't come hungry... or you'll just end up cranky from the wait.",0.0
"I came here on an impromptu date night with the girlfriend on a Monday night. When you enter the restaurant, you're greeted with a very cozy atmosphere. There is some Middle Eastern music playing in the background, but it's very subtle and you can carry on a conversation easily. Our service was pretty quick. 

We ordered kibbe and hummus moudamas (hummus w/ fava beans). They were amazing. I kind of wish they gave more than 3 kibbe balls, since they are smaller than what I am used to. Still delicious. 

The main course had us feeling like there could have been more done to make the main course shine since the presentation was subpar. We both ordered the mix dish (chicken, lamb, and kofta). The kofta was tasty, but really small. I did not like the lamb, it was kind of dry. The salad that comes with the dish was actually tasty, but the presentation was lacking--it's mainly just corn and cucumbers with some vinegar. Middle Eastern dishes usually have a more welcoming vibe, this one just felt hobbled. 

Finally, the baklava was great. It was right on the line between sweet and sickeningly sweet, but that's a good place to be for baklava.

I really want to give this place four stars since I think it has the underlying ingredients to be a great restaurant. We came with the groupon, but without it, I probably would have felt like I overpaid, especially for the main dish.

"OK, so this time we went to Iroha, the restaurant above Hagi that we went last week. Iroha serves more sushi & sashimi platters compared to their ""sibling"" downstairs. I love raw fish so we ordered sushi sashimi combo, bento box and assorted grilled appetizers on skewers. It was awesome! Good service, the host and waitress (Marika?) were very attentive, maybe because my husband speaks some (broken?) Japanese and I speak none. If you ask, which is better between Iroha and Hagi, they're different in many ways - Iroha is better for sushi-sashimi fans but Hagi is better for appetizer fans, younger version of Japanese with no focus on sushi-sashimi. Iroha is the place to enjoy sushi-sashimi. If I don't get sick from the raw fist it means ""approved!""

"Holy shiat.  A dear friend and I got two lobster rolls to-go (her recommendation) before a hasty taxi ride to La Guardia to catch a flight back to Houston..   The staff member or order taker (whatever you dub the person standing behind the desk who took our order) misheard me and didn't make the rolls to go, so while we awkwardly waited in a narrow NYC-esque restaurant with our luggage and minimal personal space (I'm from Texas), I caught sight of two wimpy looking rolls as my name was called.  No biggie, coincidences happen.  Some other guy named Daniel just happened to order the junior lobster rolls for dine-in. What a chump..  we Texans don't eat junior burgers or junior lobster rolls.   To my dismay, my dear friend (a former New Yorker) knew the gist and told the staff of their honest mistake and claimed our standard-size lobster rolls.  

So many thoughts raced through my head as he went to wrap them up.  How could something so dainty be worth nearly $35 for two?  Why are portions so much smaller in NYC?

Fortunately, I wasn't all that hungry and was more concerned about getting to the airport, through security and finding a toilet.  It wasn't until an hour into the flight while I was entrenched in reading the sick narration of the pedophile in Lolita that I recalled our lobster rolls, now cold, were ready to be eaten with our complimentary Southwest Airlines beverage of choice.  

I've rambled enough simply because the mundane events and low expectations leading up the first bite I took of the small, cold lobster roll didn't prepare me for what was truly one of the rare wow moments in my young, albeit varied terrain of food experiences.  It really was phenomenal .. I think I even did the cliché eye closing while chewing bit.    That said, I can't imagine how good this tastes fresh from the kitchen.  I'm going back again and I strongly advise anyone reading this to do so as well..   Please.",0.0
"Made a reservation for Cookshop 2 months in advance for my girlfriend's birthday brunch. Based on the reviews and rave, I thought it would be a pretty neat idea to check it out. 

Came here on Sunday noon, and had to navigate through a huge crowd standing in front of the store. Suggestion is obviously to make a reservation or suffer the pain of waiting. 

We came in and were seated immediately, received a few glares but that's ok with me. 

Sean was our server and he was a pretty nice fellow. Gave us a few recommendations and was very patient with us knowing that it was our first time here. 

Drinks:
The Champ: Essentially a ginger bellini, it was ok. 
Irish Coffee: As described, cappuccino on the rocks, definitely tastes good but it's like cheese, only some people can continue to eat it without getting sick. 

Appetizers:
Strawberry Cheesecake Danish: My girlfriend's favorite item, and I loved it too, great texture and delicious. Highly recommended.
Pecan Roll: By far my favorite item that we ordered, it's a variation of a cinnamon bun, it comes out warm and delicious. Highly recommended.

Entree:
The Egg Sandwich: My girlfriend ordered this, but I stole it from her because I did not enjoy mine. I expected something spectacular due to the raving reviews. To me, it was fried eggs with a really dry sausage patty. 
Huevos Rancheros: Was recommended this over the beef burger, though I think I would probably have enjoyed the beef burger way more. It was just messy to eat, and didn't go well with my pallet.

I think I am going to stay with steak, pancakes, waffles, fried chicken or egg benedict next time. #basic",0.0

I had the shishito peppers, pork belly baos, and sweet garlic wings and homeade lime aid.  Everything was insanly delicious.  The peppers were sweet and savory, and a few random peppers were spicyyyyy.  The buns were sick!  They were not overly fatty and the hoisin sauce added a great sweetness to em.

Mix of locals and others. Good, friendly,  bartenders, which is a huge plus, especially for the neighborhood. The waiters --as they say in Italian -- NOTTASOHOTTA. They are nice, but are either dumb girls who don't know ANYTHING (do NOT expect them to know anything about booze other than what they see on the menu...I asked once what Amaros they had, and she stared at me blankly.

Even with a much large space than the Nolita one there was still quite a wait on a weeknight in winter, so we made do drinking wine at the bar while waiting where I was lucky to snag a seat.  Once we were seated me started with the mozzarella sticks which I love and the baked clams which were also pretty sick.  I then had the chicken parm platter with baked ziti which is soooooo amazing.

"I went with my husband and daughter while visiting NY in May 2015. We chose to go to this restaurant for dinner too pay our  respects to the late, great BB King as he had just passed the previous week. Also, there was an Earth Wind and Fire tribute band playing which sounded like a good time. It was not far from our hotel (The Warwick) conveniently located in Times Square. We took a cab there for about $8 +tip. When we arrived there were 2 beautiful memorial flower arrangements which smelled amazing. (I'll try to include the pics). 

Cover charge was only $17 per person. Not bad for time square since prices for things are often severely over blown for no reason. We were escorted to a table right away and were able to choose a table with exactly the view we were hoping for. From here it was downhill. ...

It took over 30 minutes for someone to bring us menus and another 20 minutes after that to get water. (We actually had to flag someone down to get water). It was another 15-20 minutes before someone took our order and by that time we were famished. It appeared that there were only 2 waiters trying to cover the entire venue so not sure if someone called in sick or what. The prices were extremely overblown especially for the quality of the food. (My daughter's cheeseburger and fries was $22.)The bill for the 3 of us was $107. The only alcohol beverage ordered was a bud light bottle for my husband. My daughter and I had Sprite for $4 each and never were able to get them refilled. We asked for the check and had to wait another half an hour. 

The band was decent but we were so aggravated by the experience, we left half way thru the second set. 

We've been to Kings in Memphis and the experience was completely different. The 2 stars is for the band and the cover price. Everything else was a huge disappointment.",0.0

"Went here after 9 on a Tuesday night. The place was empty and I was worried it might have been a little on the late side to be sitting down for dinner with 5 other people but we were seated and attended to right away. They gave us time to order and our server Anna made some really great suggestions. We started with smo-fry wings and a fried pickle. Everyone loved the fried pickle -it was delicious! But the smo-fry wings with Thai Chili sauce were my favorite. Perfectly cooked (first smoked and then fried) and not greasy at all. The thai chili sauce was nice and sweet. As an entree I shared a half rack of ribs with a mustard based South Carolina sauce and 1/4lb of pulled pork with classic barbecue sauce. At first I was kind of skeptical about the mustard based sauce but it was highly recommended by Anna.She was right! The ribs tasted amazing and fell right off the bone. The mustard wasn't overpowering, it was light and a little bit sweet with a kick to it. Definitely try it if you've never had mustard based barbecue sauce. I would get it again. The pulled pork was  good too, but the ribs definitely stole the show. I did not feel sick or stuffed after eating here - just very satisfied.
To finish off the meal, a couple of us tried out their spiked shakes. If you like alcohol, their shakes are great. If not, then their shakes are still great. Had the dulce de leche virgin shake and I would definitely stop by just for that. My sister had the shake flavored with cherry and amaretto and you could really taste the alcohol.She could not stop drinking it.
Overall the food was great and it felt comfortable to sit and eat at Slide - dark paneling on the walls, big cozy booths and low light spotlight lighting. Very different for the neighborhood but I welcome it!

"As others stated, the quality of produce is questionable. Good luck finding a fresh onion/orange/ without mold - especially on workday nights! On top of that headache, they are missing basic ingredients (there is no canned green chilies, sweet potatoes nor fresh basil) entirely.  Sometimes I stop in the city to buy items I DOUBT I'll find here. Kinda beats the purpose of proximity of this  grocery store, right?

Worst of all - their chicken is always spoiled! I've tried 3 different brands (thinking THAT was the issue at hand), but all have stunk. I wouldn't buy salmon here again either. I believe Food Bazaar lacks quality in handling procedures of their raw poultry/seafood. Food poisoning is no joking matter, but I guess the cheap prices makes it an affordable gamble.

"Perhaps it's unfair to criticize Estela after only giving it a try for brunch.  But...I'm not willing to spend the dollars required to go back for a dinner, and I feel like potential brunchers deserve a heads up, especially when this was the first place to pop up on Yelp for ""breakfast & brunch"" while standing at Houston & Bowery.  



I came here with three friends for a Sunday brunch, and was able to walk in and sit right away even though one guy hadn't arrived yet.  Great start, and the toast with lardo and jam ""snack"" we ordered to tide us over was outstanding.  Coffee was weak and a bit bitter, but otherwise, things are looking promising.



The waitress told us that the menu was designed to share.  At brunch, and with delicious sounding egg/pancetta/avocado sandwiches, French toast, and eggs benedict (it's not called a benedict, and the waitress actually seemed offended when we called it a benedict, but it's eggs/bacon/Hollandaise, so that's what it is), I'm not super interested in small plates for sharing.  She then warned us that the French toast is ""very small,"" so don't order it intended as a meal.  Taking her warning to heart, we order egg sandwiches and benedicts.  



Everything was fine, but extraordinarily small.  So small that one of us joked that if the waitress was worried about the French toast being small, it might have just been a piece of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  For $16 apiece, an egg sandwich should not be so small that I'm still hungry enough that I agree to order dessert after eating it.  (A word on dessert:  stay away from the panna cotta, unless the phrase ""sickly sweet"" is appealing to you.)  Personally, I was not a fan of the bun that came with the egg/pancetta/avocado sandwich, which was also quite sweet, but the actual egg was cooked very well, and had some nice hot sauce mixed in.

I would actually rather buy from the limited organic supply at Keyfood because the people are just plain NICE and go out of their way for you if you ask for or need something.  So that's my two cents. I'm bummed because it was convenient for me but I'm just done!",0.0
"Other than the pesky fact that a bagel with lox and cream cheese ran to about $13, it is totally obvious that this place is run by two defectors from Zabar's smoked fish counter. I am admittedly no expert on lox - just know that it was delicious, because I finished said $13 bagel in about 3 bites (ain't no one got time for that thing called chewing). 

Whitefish salad ... why did it take me 25 years to discover this thing? I think my mom made a sad mayo-drippy rendition of it with tuna once whenever I was home sick from the stomach bug. They've got crab salad, lobster salad, tuna salad, shrimp salad, etc. 

People at the counter are awesome about giving you as many samples as you can handle. I am also crazy about their multigrain tortilla chips in the individual plastic containers. Yes, yes, I know you can buy a whole bag of it for a few cents more but while other people have pedicures and golf clubs, this is my irrational splurge.",0.0
"The fish tacos could have been good but they were so extremely salty, I could only eat a little bit of them. I would have sent them back, but I had gotten take-out. It wasn't just the fish tacos either, it was also the salsa. I got chips and salsa and could only eat the chips because the salsa was too salty. Literally their food tasted like they dumped an entire salt shaker of salt in the food, and I'm not even someone who is very sensitive to seasonings.

But the WORST part was our flan was covered in BLACK FURRY MOLD!! My husband and I saved it and walked back to show them, at which point the person working there took out another flan to show us the flan is fine, and I pointed that it was covered in blue mold. Yeah, I feel sick to my stomach right now.",0.0
This place is just awful. 1) They are infested with roaches. They should be shut down immediately. I saw multiple roaches while dining here. 2) The staff are all awful and rude. They have the worst service. Everything about this place is disgusting and makes me sick to my stomach.,0.0
"Please don't come here! It is filled with roaches (hence the ""grade pending"" sign). I understand it is New York City and roaches are a problem but it made me really sick to my stomach when I saw the roach AFTER we were finished eating and paid. The waiter saw the roach when we were leaving and did not do anything to get rid of it. The bus boys just picked up the plates and cleaned the table when we stood (he also ignored the roach and let it run away)!",0.0
Went to this place with my family to celebrate my birthday ! Waiter was so rude and unhappy or just because we have a child with us ...Not sure but he was coming with dirty looks all the time tried many times to clean the table while eating like just go ... Couldn't enjoy the steak the wine ... Made me feel so uncomfortable and disgusted in the same time !! Managers notice and apologize but how is possible to pay $300 dollars and ruin your birthday just for a miserable waiter .. Even the guy who came with the food was able to be nicer and tried to communicate with my kid ... Used to go there with the company and was different ... How u can discriminate families ..shame on this place !!! Understand children aren t wanted in restaurant but mine was very behaved ... Should say ! It's not worth it to go to this  place unless company pays ! The steaks are too salty and dishes not so tasty !And staff sucks ! It's like the most miserable guy on this planet comes to your table while eating and looking sarcastic and like enjoying that !!There are plenty steakhouses who can treat costumers with respect ! Trying to get the food while eating ??!! And having a nasty face all the time just made sick to my stomach ! Had table 803 on May 18 2015 !! Shame on management for hiring these people and having no respect for customers ! Paid 300 to fell disgusted !!  Uhhh... Maybe management should train these guys how to behave !!

I'm torn. Taste- and price-wise I'd definitely give it a 5 star. The issue is that I always get stomach pain when I eat here. Don't get me wrong. I just think that I'm allergic against something they put in their food. The food looks super fresh and it's always busy so their turn-around on food must be incredibly fast. Due to the getting sick issues I haven't been here for a year but really would love to come back and give it another chance because it's sooooooo delicious!,0.0

"I really wanted this coffee to be great.  I'm so sick of Nespresso's prices although their coffee is delicious.  I tried all of the HiLine flavors and they just seem weak to me.  The other problem I have with it is that the foil covering the pods seems too thick for my Nespresso machine to pierce.  I really have to force the handle down and I'm afraid of breaking it.  I read reviews on Amazon and quite a few other people experienced the same thing.  This might actually be the reason that the coffee tastes weak, the foil tops aren't being pierced enough to let the coffee through.  I hate to say it but I'm probably not going to order from HiLine again due to these problems.",0.0
My husband and I just went there for an early dinner this past Saturday. It was such an enjoyable experience! Our food was delicious and hot.

"We were here on Wednesday night to see Bonjourney. I had never been here so I didn't know  what to expect. We had a blast! First of all, we were not expeccting an opening band--BRB-Best Rock Ballads.  These guys were awesome.  The band was tight and the lead singer's  voice was sick! Bonjourney was amazing as well, the lead singer's voice was insane! So, great show. If this is the kind of talent showcased here, I'll be going back. There is a huge dance floor so that is great if you want to dance.
The food IS pricey but it was damned tasty--appetizers were so yum: chicken n' waffles, pulled pork sliders,catfish bites,nachos.
Sorry to say, the service not great. We saw our waiter at the start of the night and never saw him again , about an hour after our food came out.  Too bad for them we would have ordered more drinks. Maybe they were short-staffed.",0.0
"I have not tried any of the food at Montague Bagels but I was treated horribly by the owner earlier tonight and while there are many wonderful businesses on Montague, this is not one of them. 

My dog chewed on something on the street today and started choking. I was outside this bagel place and walked inside and asked for one of those tiny plastic cups of water (the mini clear ones intended for free water). The woman behind the counter was very nice and said of course. She filled a cup for me at which point the owner, who was standing by the counter, informed me that I would have to pay for it. 

I thought he was joking at first because it's waterfor a choking animal (and even if it wasn't an emergency, I have NEVER been given a hard time when I've asked establishments to fill up my water bottle at the sink, etc.). When I realized he looked serious-- in fact, he looked rather angry and aggressive, I clarified: you want me to pay? I didn't have my wallet on me because I live a block away and also it's WATER. He asked me if I knew how much the cup cost and I said I didn't know. He then asked me if I thought water was free to which I said yes. He asked if I'd like him to go into the back and get his water bill so he could show me it wasn't free. At that point, I was concerned about my dog and about this man's sanity/humanity so I left. 

Needless to say, I will never be going back here and my friends from the neighborhood who I met later for dinner were all equally horrified and will never patronize this place either. 

The owner clearly is on some sick power trip and I wish I had gone across the street to Connecticut Muffin in the first place where they filled a tiny cup of water at the sink and were gracious about it.",0.0
"the juices were not very tasty - granted they are a cleanse, but still, add some apple to all the juices. Apple makes things sweeter and taste better. Anyhow, I vomitted after the 3rd juice, not because of the taste, but because there was just too much juice in my stomach and I guess couldnt fit any more. I'm a very small person, thin, and short. I started this cleanse just to ween off sugar and caffeine, but I do not recommend this cleanse for people who are very small to begin with. Lesson learned. I gave away my juices since I was not going to continue with the cleanse after vomitting.

"If you ever see my check in history, you see this place has developed a spot in my heart.

Manhattan has so many great ice cream places. Seriously I can't go a block without finding somewhere new. 

But this place is unique so it stands out and gets some extra points.

It's creamed ice. It's not anything like a snow cone. It's not ice ice. But it's more like an icier version of snow days ""flavored snow."" It's a great fun texture that's truly refreshing.

And while my wife hates the texture, they have delicious soft serve that they make all sorts of exciting sundaes with (like the $5 sea salt caramel pretzel ghiradelli sundae with whipped cream that's so much ice cream I get sick).

They have a million flavored and ou can sample anything or return a flavor you unexpectedly didn't like (happened a couple times with me and the staff is always happy to assist)

NB: this place is just a stand against Baruch college so be aware if it's raining or you are going at a peak hour (it gets crowded). Go now! It won't last! It's seasonal and closes for good in October!",0.0
"After seeing all the amazing press that Atoradero was getting, the landlord of 800 E. 149th St. decided to raise the rent an extra $1200 a month.

Location is very busy, mix of officers workers and tourists.  Lines can be long during peak times.  Location is pretty small and tight.

Expect to wait at least twenty minutes until you get a chance to order.

Condiments bar was disorganized and unclean.

Staff is very nice and professional, but food tasted very bland for some reason.  Been to many other locations and others have tasted fresher.  

When I eating, the men's bathroom flooded.  $H!TTY toilet water was gushing out and underneath the door.  The pool then spread across the floor and next to the soda machine.  I have witnessed numerous customers reporting the incident to the workers, but they didn't seem to give a CRAP (literally) about the situation and continued to take orders from customers.  

It probably took them a good 15 minutes before someone came out to check on the toilet pool.  When a worker did come out to clean it, all he did was take a squeegee and pushed the water UNDER THE SODA MACHINE.  There's a hole in the ground, but it's the same hole that is shared by the soda machine tubes.  The same tubes that bring up the soda and syrup for mixing and thus...that is what you drink. I'm not sure where the toilet water went when it went down into the hole, but I sure as hell hope that it didn't mix with the soda people drink.

"I come here periodically and with the closing of Blarney Stone, find it one of the dwindling places were you can drink like its meant to be.

Booze prices are fair and service attentive.  Old school Irish bartenders who understand the relationship between a man (or woman) and their drink.  Even after only a couple of visits, the early tender knew what and how much I wanted.  Food is what you expect, since it is first and foremost a place to drink.

Commuters, old men, office workers (men and women), union guys . . .  everyone with their money on the bar, ordering clearly, drinking politlely and respecting the Drinker's Compact:

1. Know what you like - if not, learn on your on time/account
2. Don't waste the bartender's time - its my time too
3. Be ready to pay, don't act surprised or delay (see point 2)
4. Tip 15% or more
5. Repeat

I am not a bartender, never was, never wanted to be.  Just want to encourage responsible drinking and I don't mean moderation.

NOTE: I read a lot of Yelp reviews were bartenders are criticized without patrons ever acknowledging their responsibility as a member of society.  One recent review for a Chelsea based bar complained the bartender was unpleasant and she should find another job.  I know for a fact her father just passed away the day before.  Bartenders get $4.90 an hour without any benefits, do more than most patrons realize and  have bad days just like you.  They get no sick days or compassional leave.  No work, no pay.

"I really hate the fact the place is poorly designed with the furniture and air ventilation system. Black Tree is extremely tight since they want to make the most of their space.

We looked at the glass half full and looked at each other, then looked at the glass half empty and again at each other. Where the heck did the rest of the alcohol go?? I wouldn't recommend #1, maaaaaybe #2, but I didn't like the #1 cocktail on their menu. As my friend put it, ""It smells like something you'd rub on your chest when you're sick.""

Salad: Pretty good.

Bread sticks: Delicious!

Entree: It was really disgusting. It's utterly sickening that they consider Olive Garden authentic Italian food. Honestly, if i was an Italian I would feel really offended and start a petition to get this food chain closed. Me and my friend ordered the 5 cheese ziti, and I'm pretty sure the ziti is supposed to be baked since it looks baked in every single advertisement and on the menu provided online. Instead, we were given ziti pasta with flavorless sauce with Parmesan cheese. What happened to the 4 other cheeses? God only knows.

The food here is so delicious. I thought that this location might not be as busy as their main location on 125th st, but it was pretty busy by 6 pm on a Friday. Also, note that they don't give you a table until everyone in your group shows up. I had a green coconut thai curry and my friend had a tonkotsu ramen. We both loved our broth and how wonderfully deep it was in flavor! (We had different broths, which was nice to know that they don't use the same broth for all their dishes.) Too be honest however, the broth was so rich that it got a little sickening by the end. The green coconut thai curry ramen had three hot peppers next to it on the menu, but I don't think it was too spicy. I would love to try the kimchee ramen if I ever return. It was a pretty good price and the waiters were very accommodating and nice about that fact that my friend and I just talked for an hour after we paid our bill. 

The food was incredibly filling and a pretty big portion for the price.",0.0
"I really enjoyed my experience at Jacob's Pickles.  It is a cool atmosphere with tasty food to back it up.  

We were told the wait would be 20 minutes and that's exactly what it was, which is helpful.  The fact that they text you when your table is ready is also great.  

We started with the biscuits and fixins.  The biscuits are huge, buttery, fluffy, and flavorful.  The maple butter on the side was also delicious.  These are some of the best biscuits I've had.  

The entrees were also quite good.  I really enjoyed the catfish tacos--the fish was well cooked and the slaw and sauce were great.  The bacon,egg, and cheese biscuit was also awesome.  Everything went together really well and the chicken had a nice kick to it.  

Not to be forgotten, the drinks were also noteworthy.  I particularly liked the apple moonshine.

The one big miss of the meal was dessert.  If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I'm OBSESSED with bread pudding.  Naturally, I had to order the biscuit bread pudding.  First, it's HUGE (which is almost always a plus in my book); however, this thing was GIGANTIC.  I took a few bites and was disgusted.  It basically tasted like undercooked biscuits with a bunch of cruddy tasting ice cream on top.  This dish was not sweet at all.  It takes a lot for me not to devour dessert and I actually felt sick after 2-3 bites.  I think this dish would be much improved if they added something to sweeten it up like caramel or chocolate.

Overall, Jacob's is one of the better restaurants I've been to lately and I am definitely eager to return soon.",0.0
"I was visiting a friend in the neighborhood and wedecided to make dinner at his place rather than go out. We both had a craving for seafood and got the idea in our heads for stuffed squid, so we headed here.

This market doesn't have quite the kind of warmth or personality you might want from a neighborhood business. But that said, I've never seen a small fish shop like this one that was so clean. Everything was tantalizingly fresh looking and the prices were affordable. It makes the thought of shopping at Trader Joe's for seafood kind of a sick joke when you have a place like this nearby. I live in the UWS and even I have a hard time getting seafood this fresh and clean.

The squid for example was pearly white and impeccable.  I'd never seen squid so - perfect and thoroughly cleaned

"This might be my favorite Bareburger location. I've visited a few now and while I enjoy the bison burger I'll give this full disclosure: it's not my favorite burger in the city (what? why is she even bothering with this review then? what's haaaappening!?) Hang in there folks. Here's the thing. When I want a bison burger....nothing else will due but the Bareburger bison burger. It's like an addiction. I'm not sure what's going on, but it's like a GPS chip has been activated and I ignore all other directives. I don't respond to text messages, forget about Facebook, ignore my personal responsibilities, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars...go directly to Bareburger and get the bison burger. Because it's superior in its own category. This much is true. 

Last night, that's what happened. Maybe it's because I'm battling the sinus cold sniffles, but all I wanted, nay needed, was a bison burger and fries, and so I grabbed a friend and hightailed it to Bareburger. This was my first time at this location and was lucky enough to be seated in Hannah's section. Hannah saved my antihistamine swirled life. In my loopy delirum I (somewhat aggressively) ordered (demanded) my burger...then apologized and explained that I wasn't feeling well and was just really really hungry and out of it. Hannah was so sweet! When I requested a hot toddy (my go to sick beverage...seriously it works!) she figured out a way to put in an order for it even though it's not on the drinks menu.  

It was my friend's first time at Bareburger and he asked Hannah for suggestions. She had great suggestions that were totally different than the same suggestions I've heard at every other Bareburger I've visited, and she was spot on with our orders. The food came out fast, and Hannah kept checking on us (me...pretty sure she thought I was gonna keel over at her table but that's ok...she played it off well). And she didn't rush us out the door when the check came even though I'm sure it was a busy night. Thanks Hannah for the great service and for making this sick girl feel so much better!

"So here's the story.

4:28 PM: Placed my order and got a confirmation email. 
Seamless told me the delivery should be here latest within 45 minutes. 

5:30 PM: I called to make sure they hadn't forgotten about me. The guy on the phone told me the delivery guy was out with my pizza and should be at my place within 10-15 minutes.

6:00 PM: Walked four flights down to get some fresh air and hopefully see the delivery guy (by this time my stomach was audibly grumbling)

6:10 PM Still nothing. I call again. I'm told that the delivery guy is making several deliveries at once and ""should be here any minute"" 

6:20 PM: I go back upstairs and munch on cereal. 

6:30 PM: Doorbell rings. At this point I'm seriously debating whether or not I should tip. But I do it anyway out of the good of my heart.

"After reading mixed reviews for a few months, I finally decided to just go. I'm a long time vegetarian/2-year vegan but, like many others, just can't get down with much of the fake meat. I kept reading reviews about how heavily they relied on mock meats so I was nervous.

My friend and I went with the tapas option so we could get a fair impression of the menu. We were hungry so we got 6 total: Dijon Marinated Raw Kale, Mama's No-Soy Meatballs, Root Vegetable Latkes, Sunflower Lentil Pâté, Thai Ginger BBQ Seitan, and Beet Noodles with Peanut Sauce (a special).

Kale gets a solid B. Nothing to write home about but delicious and well-dressed (not dry, not drenched in dressing)

The pâté didn't do it for me. My dinnermate really liked it though. It was fine, just a little bland and didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. Not bad by any means, but I wouldn't order it again.

I don't like seitan, period. I don't know why we ordered it. Maybe because of the sauce, which was awesome. If I liked seitan's meaty chewy fatness I would be all over this but I just can't get myself there. This isn't the restaurant's fault so I'm not counting it against them. IF YOU LIKE SEITAN you will love it!

NOW, for the good shit. The meatballs are lentil-based rather than any kind of fake meat nonsense, and I wouldn't change anything about them. I was disturbed that I couldn't find anything wrong with them at all.  I couldn't believe it but it was one of the best tomato sauces I've ever had. I was shocked. Someone actually spent TIME crafting this sauce--the onions were fall-apart tender, it was garlicky, a tiny touch of spice, and the acidity was perfectly balanced. I would never have expected this and it almost feels weird to say it, but this is the real deal.

LATKES: what kind of sick, tyrannical bastard makes latkes in a fucking waffle iron? When I find the person responsible for this I swear I'll...*takes a bite*...give them both of my kidneys and write them into my will. This is what latkes are really supposed to be. Flat is out. And the dill? Jesus. Someone give this chef a raise straight from my bank account.

The beet noodles with a spicy peanut sauce need to be put on the regular menu. As I was scraping the leftover droplets of sauce off the plate with my fork (no shame) I was already trying to recreate the recipe in my head so that I could go home and eat as much as I could fit in me in the privacy of my own home.

I hate that this review is so full of praise, so I'm going to stop there. OH WAIT, but not before I tell you to just do yourself a favor for once and order the Triple Chocolate Brownie Sundae w/ ice cream, truffle creme, & chopped peanuts!!!!!! This shouldn't be a hard sell! Stop being dramatic and just tack 3 minutes onto your next run. Live a little!

Needless to say, I'll be back here again and again and again and again.",0.0
"Unlimited booze and food brunch on New Years Day! Happy New Year to me! We loves our unlimited boozy brunches here in NYC. Any reason to get liquored up in the afternoon is a good thing!

I set up this boozy brunch on New Years Day for a group of us since most stayed in on NYE. Heck, going out that night is amateur hour anyway and overpriced at best.

Had a 1:30 reservation and were seated around 2:00. No biggie, as I knew it would be crowded here. Unlimited brunch is for two hours and we were told they would not kick us out at 4:00 when it ended. Hey, for $39 it's basically a steal. Unlimited cocktails of all types and family style plates of tapas on the whole menu. Yes, the WHOLE menu. There is a lot to choose from here. I really loved the spicy bloody mary and the mango mimosa. Those went down way too easy! Plus, they certainly did not skimp on the booze! I also tried the lychee mimosa and the tequila spiked agua fresca. A few traditional margaritas also made it into my mouth. Wowza! I drank a lot of booze in those two hours.

Have to love a Mexican restaurant with this kind of deal on New Years Day. To me, there is something so festive about Mexican food that it was a perfect fit for our celebration. As I said, there was so much to choose from. Mexican style corn on the cob, chipotle crispy bacon, huevos rancheros, chicken enchiladas, bacon wrapped hot dog, ceviche, chicken tamal, Mexican French Toast with Nutella, quesadillas, braised pork shoulder tacos, eggs benedict, tortas, carmelized plantains, and many more. I'll admit some plates hit it out of the park, and some were just ok. You name it as we ate it! Get in mah bellah!

Service was hit or miss. Our waitress was nice enough and seemed a bit forgetful on some orders but it didn't matter to me. We had a lot of booze and food flowing. The food came out slowly at the start as the place was packed. Being in the industry as a bartender back in the day I just knew they would be short staffed today. It's notorious for people to call on sick on New Years Day and this was no different. She was working all the tables in our area by herself. I think it was the owner/manager who came up to me and chatted for a bit to apologize for the slow service and waits on food and drink refills. Again, it was no big deal as we were all having a blast with great company over booze filled fun conversations. I did notice that after he came by the food and drinks started hitting our table a lot faster. I do appreciate the great customer service. That always adds a positive to my review of any business.

Overall. a wonderful choice for our New Years Day partying. The food was pretty decent, and the drinks were flavorful and strong. Beats the heck of going out on New Years Eve and paying $100 or more for lackluster drinks in an overcrowded place filled with the bridge and tunnel crew. 

Dat nutella French Toast tho.,....

And dat crispy plate of bacon tho.....

Dat spicy bloody mary tho.....

"The food is very good. I believe the best way to eat it is to go there, or to order through Seamless. I had way too many delivery mistakes when I've called that I don't comprehend. Dennis (the owner/manager) is a good guy. David is nice. The rest of the guys could be a bit friendlier and could work harder to get basic orders correct. Thank God for Seamless, even though there was one tiny mistake in the last delivery (one of the mini bagels wasn't sliced, as requested), everything was correct for the most part. That hasn't been the case when I've called and was extremely clear on the phone. I hate to be a complainer. And the issue isn't just with Bagel Bobs. It's like every place I order deliveries from there is always *something* not right. I guess these restaurants are just moving too fast to make sure the orders are 100% correct. I'm about to give Bagel Bobs another whirl through Seamless. I'm really hoping they get it 100% correct. But again, the food here is very good. If you're getting a delivery, however, you can expect *something* to not be right.  But I do believe Dennis cares about the business and about his customers. He's probably sick of my reviews. I just remember everything always being perfect when I was a regular at Bagel Bobs on University in the Village back in the 90's and early 2000's....this place would be 5 stars if I judged on food solely....and if I can get like 5 perfect deliveries from them in a row, without any tiny (though annoying) mistakes, I'll bump the 3 stars up to 5.",0.0
"Just dined here earlier tonight with my boyfriend and it was by far the worse Applebee's( well restaurant in general) experience we've had. Our waiter from the get go was very rude, unprofessional, and  inattentive. He did not bother bringing out our drinks either. We stopped a waitress after a while  to ask if they only bring out drinks with the meals. She replied no and went to inform him that we wanted our drinks. The entire time we watched him chatting away with another waiter.  Regardless after she informed him he did not bother getting the drinks right away. When our food was brought to us we asked where our appetizer was..  Our waiter than brought out our appetizer which was not hot and barely warm because it was probably sitting there for a while. The mere fact that he did not bring out our appetizer before our entrees just shows how inattentive he was towards us. The sad part is, we watched and listened to him take orders from another couple sitting in front of us and his demeanor and attitude was completely different towards them. It made us wonder and question why we were being treated so poorly in comparison to the other couple. Our entrees were not good either. My boyfriend barely ate his meal he ordered the tilapia. I took one bite and understood why he could not eat it.  It looked and tasted horrible. My chicken tenders were not good either. I tried to eat as much of my meal as possible. I obviously did not  want to waste food. The food tasting horrible is not the waiters fault. However the terrible service is. Also not offering to comp his meal or at least our fountain drinks in my opinion was sad. Poor customer service and probably poor training by the manager or whoever's in charge of that. We are still wondering why we were treated so different compared to the other people he waited on by us. If he was judging us based on appearance or maybe he thought a young couple would not tip well so why bother trying  well he's in for a rude awakening. We are actually huge tippers when treated politely . Even if the food is horrible we truly believe in tipping great service. I don't believe in discriminating or treating customers different from one another. This was the first time I'll admit we did not tip. As hard as it was to not tip the guy I wanted to stand my ground. In the past I would tip well no matter how good or bad the service. However not anymore, I'm sick of poor service at restaurants. I don't care if you are a 5 star steakhouse or a casual Applebee's.  We wanted to make it very clear to this waiter that the way he treated us was not okay. Better training or hiring a more qualified wait staff is something the manger should take into consideration. You are better off going to Little Lamb next door if you enjoy  Asian cuisine. At least the food is decent and the staff is very friendly and attentive!",0.0
"I think you must hold a restaurant of this caliber to a higher standard. It was meh. Not everything, but enough to end up with meh.
Started with an uni app, lardo, seasalt. The uni was fishy (?!). I love uni. No, like i want to bathe in it. Serious problem. Why did they ruin the uni? I think they torched it or put it under the impinger. Why?! You sick m-f-er! It doesn't work. At all. Ever. Hang your head in shame. 
We got caviar next. They didn't make it. They only serve it. No points for opening a container.

Skipped the oysters because they didn't have anything really that special that I can't get at home.

Next was butterfish crudo. Really really really excellent. Well done. Right temp. Bravo.

Pasta was our fourth. They originally were out of the pasta my wife chose. Then they made it anyway. That took balls. It was a thick noodle with spicy ragu with crab and uni. No fishy taste or smell, which confirms they messed up the app.They also made us a lovely take on linguini with clams. This stole the show! Wow! Get this!

We then shared a scallop dish. Good, but not memorable. The scallops were slightly overcooked. They should be rare/ med rare. These were medium. Chef strike two. Ruined another expensive ingredient. 

Deserts were meh. Too many layers.

Strike three: no amuse. 

We did get a fabulous bottle of champagne ('99 Salon), with a hefty 200% mark up. 

Would i go back? No. Would I recommend it? No.
Does it deserve anything? No.",0.0
"Venue: Sketchy entrance and dark creepy hallway to the elevator. Take the elevator to the top. The bar itself is pretty nice with views and outdoor rooftop seating. The summer is better.

Service: Horrible. Inattentive. Unorganized.

Came here for an event that the organizer called beforehand. Happy hour starts at 5pm. We came after 5pm and they were still setting things up. No bartender in sight. ""DJ"" had one of Avril Lavigne's songs on repeat (we got really sick of it after heaing it replay over 5x). Called again to make sure it was actually open and that a bartender would be there. Bartender didn't show up until 30 minutes later (he was clearly taking his time smoking on the outside patio and definitely saw us come in, but didn't care). We basically sat there unattended for over 30 minutes while all staff members ignored us and chatted with each other.",0.0
"While I like the Arby's Markey Fresh Sandwiches I am about to go on a rant about a new item I just saw on the menu. Gyro's? NOOOO! Oh no you didn't!

One does not simply put deli meat on a pita bread and call it a gyro. This is not a real gyro. I am not even Greek but I am offended on behalf of all Greek people everywhere!

Aside from that the chicken sandwiches aren't too bad but those and the turkey is all I will ever eat here. The rest of the meats look super processed and unappetizing. What is cool is the fact that I am always getting bogo coupons in the mail from them. Those pretty much run you a little over 5 dollars for two sandwiches which is great for a inexpensive meal on the go. 

The Horsey sauce is the bomb, I put it on everything! Not really a fan of the curly fries. The shakes are bad ass when they have a promotion good flavor. The last time I went all they had was Orange Cream which I'd imagine is pretty gross. The salted caramel shake needs to make a comeback, I could drink myself sick on those. 

Free refills on the drinks, plenty of sauces available to go around. Before and after school hours you can find this place mobbed with Francis Lewis High School kids hanging out but on the weekends it's not so bad and the drive through moves pretty quickly.",0.0

"This Italian franchise which has only this one single outpost in New York after the other one closed is by far, and I mean BY FAR, the best frozen yogurt I've had in the city, and it's really unfortunate that the location of this place in a more clothes-shopping-oriented stretch of Broadway just above Houston has kept it under the radar.  Everyone I've brought here -- friends, relatives, European tourists I encountered nearby on the street as I was coming out of Yogorino who were saying sour-sounding European words and seemed like they needed something sweet to eat -- has come away raving about it.  Even if you're used to the sickly sweet artificiality of Pinkberry, Red Mango, 16 Handles and the rest, unless you eat Lucky Charms for breakfast, guzzle Big Gulps and down Slurpees for dessert, you will experience this frozen yogurt as a revelation because it tastes like, well, ACTUAL FROZEN YOGURT, with just the right super-creamy, tangy sweetness without the artificial junk (and they actually DO use really good ingredients).  They may have only one handle rather than 16 (sorry for those who want their frozen yogurt to come in a popcorn-watermelon-cotton-candy-high-fructose-corn-syrup flavor), but you'll see that that one handle dispenses stuff that renders the other 15 handles purely superfluous.  If you need other flavors, they have great toppings (I enjoy the dark chocolate ganache and sour cherry sauce myself, but there are also fresh berries).  In addition, they have great organic gelato (I also like the sour cherry flavor, but I happen to love sour cherries), and in the colder months, they have crepes (including gluten-free crepes) that you can wrap your gelato or yogorino in.  I'm not employed by Yogorino, I don't get paid to promote them, and I'm not friends with the owners or anything, but I'll keep singing this place's praises because I really don't want it to close like the other Yogorino on Bleeker St. did (though I think they closed because those guys were lazy and kept closing the place earlier than their official hours said, so that I came here like five times before their posted closing time and found they'd closed down early each time).",0.0

"Very disturbing experience here last night. Watched the owner - who was standing stock-still at the back of the room while a brand-new waitress struggled to keep up with a full house - angrily shove her from behind toward our table. Never in my life or in all my travels have I ever seen a business owner raise his hand like that against an employee, let alone a man (or rather, a ""man"") against a small woman he outweighs by a good 40 pounds. Truly sickening, and we're done with Generico's based on that alone. 

The food? Yeah, there was a problem with the food, too, that was handled unprofessionally, but who cares? We stayed to support the waitress, who was definitely shaken by what this guy did, but he's made his last dime off of us. If you want to support a business where employees are literally pushed around like that, well, that's your call.",0.0

"Two friends and I planned a private brunch at Tribeca Tap House for two friends who are expecting their first child.  I've hosted and/or planned a fair amount of private events, and this, by far, was the worst service I have ever received from an event planner and staff.

* First, the event planner, Jaclyn, was rude and miserable.  Event planners at almost every other restaurant I've worked with are welcoming, warm and accommodating.  She was miserable, disorganized and unprofessional.  Her overall attitude put a damper on the afternoon.

* We were told we could show up at 11 AM to begin set-up for a 12 PM start time.  When we arrived in the room, it was a mess and not ready for us to begin set up at all.  There was a baby shower the previous day, and leftover favors, bottles of wine and other odds and ends were scattered all over the room.  Chairs were stacked on the tables, and the booths were dirty and covered with crumbs.  If my husband and my friend's husband were not there, we never would have gotten that room ready in time.

* We were also told that there were three TVs in the room, and that each could display either a slide show or a single picture if we had a USB memory stick.  Not only did two TVs NOT have USB ports, but the staff couldn't get the third to work, and just gave up!

* With regards to the pictures, I handed the memory sticks to Jaclyn at 11:30 AM.  When I asked her at almost 12 PM why they weren't in the TVs, she told me that only one member of staff knew how they worked, and he was manning the bar upstairs, and he would be down when he was done serving customers.  I'm sorry, but I'm paying you over $1000 to host a private event.  Get him down here.  

* The bar was a MESS.  First, none of the taps worked, so at a place called the Tap House, only bottled beer was available.  Then, either a glass of red wine was spilled, or the sink in the bar leaked (didn't see which), but there was a puddle of red wine on the floor, and the father to be had to ask one of the staff for a mop!  Furthermore, the event started at 12 PM, and we didn't have a bartender until 12:25 PM.  

* At the beginning of the afternoon, Jaclyn had a cash box and a table outside.  She started collecting money, and then became the bartender and had no one take over for her.  So we're running around, trying to figure out who paid, and who didn't, because halfway through, there was no one to take money!  Which made settling the contract a nightmare (see below).

* The food service was terribly slow.  The dishes didn't come out until almost 1:30 PM, and the penne vodka was extremely al dente, bordering on undercooked.  

* Settling the bill and the contract was a complete and utter disaster.  Apparently, Jaclyn is relatively new to the job, and when we first we working with the Taphouse, and their previous event planner, they agreed to lower the minimum spend from $1500 to $1000.  She initially insisted that the minimum spend was $1500.  Furthermore, some people weren't able to make it at the last minute (sick kids, family emergencies, etc.), and she was also saying that we had to pay for the no-shows.  You are NOT a wedding venue (believe me, I know the difference, since I only got married 6 months ago).  As long as we hit the minimum, which we did, just re-adjust the contract.  

* To add insult to injury, since she wasn't on top of people paying, she insisted that we came up two people short, so I needed to make up the difference.  Given that you and your staff were unaccommodating and disorganized, the bar had no draft beer, and the food service was slow, wouldn't you MAYBE consider giving us a discount?  Nope!  So, I paid $82 for mystery guests.

I will NEVER go back to the Taphouse again for a private event.  I was beyond disappointed.",0.0
"The service is definitely a whole lot better than the food. We went for brunch and were squarely disappointed by both orders of eggs (the truffled one and the za'atar). The za'atar eggs arrived tepid on a somewhat tough English muffin (unless it was a bagel, I couldn't even tell!) and the truffled one had a sauce that was just too sickeningly fatty. The sumac fries here are great but for most of the year you can just get them down the road - on the street- at the Ilili box kiosk in front of the flatiron with the same dip and dressing. The dessert was ambitious (gastronomically speaking), complicated (I liked asking a friendly staff member to deconstruct all the elements) but in the end not entirely successful in terms of how it tasted (the pistachio cake element is all style with its airy puffiness but tastes like factory made plastic covered asian grocery store cake). But, this part I don't have too much problem with because if the chef's going on a limb trying something magnificently different (sphericalized pear bubbles, dehydrated brown butter etc) then I'm willing to risk not liking it. Tepid eggs are however another story. On the bright side the staff is attentive, friendly, will make sure you're comfortable and have what you need. I'm not too inclined to go again though dinner (which doesn't involve eggs) could be a very different experience.",0.0
"My daughter is quite the little Francophile so when she saw a macaron shop she was thrilled! It's just too bad that the staff vanished when we walked in. Honestly, I could have stolen their stock if I wanted! The shop was literally abandoned when we walked in. Sickening. I was left to explain why someone would refuse to serve us without touching on the fact that I think it's because we're non Jews. How would I explain that after we just discussed her great grandmother surviving the Holocaust?! Forget it. I'll take my business elsewhere and make sure to warn my friends to avoid this place. Not cool, bo bon, not cool.",0.0
"The Frying Pan is definitely not for those who suffer from sea sickness or constant rocking of the ship/boat but you'll have a great experience overall. Went there on a nice, hot summer day, met up with friends, had to order fries because that alone was pricey ($5 or $10 if I remember) but it tasted awesome. Also had sangria which was very good. The design of the bathrooms below the deck was decent and efficient. I went around 7pm on a Sunday so there was a crowd but it wasn't too little nor too big a crowd. The only downside is finding a place to sit even though the boat/ship is huge! So you may have to send a friend early to save a table or sit for ya.

"There was only 1 other table besides ours when we went in for dinner. The server was asking how we were when another woman whispers in his ear while pointing and looking at us. We were immediately concerned over what she was saying. There was no way it was anything like ""make sure you treat them well"" or she wouldn't be whispering. I don't know what possessed us to stay. We had the fish and it was just okay. We were concerned the food was tampered with from the whispering. Fortunately, neither of us got sick but there is no way we will return. Why stop our server, look and point at us and whisper something in his ear right in front of us? We talked about it afterwards and came to the conclusion that if we return we are just begging for them to make us sick.

"I've had a lot of frozen yogurt and of all places I've tried, Fresk'o is the one of the few to blow my mind.  The outside looks like an overrated overly decorated neon-colored generic frozen yogurt place, but trust me, this stuff is delicious!  

Make sure you ask for sample cups so you can try the yummy flavors and offerings.  Prices are something like 49 cents an ounce for froyo - pretty average.

Flavors you HAVE to get - watermelon sorbet and cake batter.  The watermelon sorbet isn't what you'd think it is - it's not too crazy sugary and the consistency is just like a soft sorbet and not icy at all.. it's also not too tangy.  Perfect if you want something refreshing.  If you're looking for something creamy, the cake batter is where it's at.  It's smooth, creamy, not too rich, and tastes just like vanilla cake batter... mmmm.

"I really can't say anything bad about this place!  Tonight was my first experience with them.  I'm usually a bit hesitant to order from a new place. One that I don't know much about.  I wanted to try something new and I'm sick of ordering from the same places all of the time so I gave Fresco a shot.  Glad I did because this is some of the freshest food I've had in a while!  The guy who called us to make sure our order was correct and the delivery guy were both very friendly and helpful.  Delivery was quick.  Prices are decent.  You get a good amount of food for what you are paying.  Glad there's a place in the area to get a great sandwich from.  I really don't want to go to a place like Superior Deli or the like for something like that because you're not really getting quality and Subway isn't fresh.  They use all Boars Head cold cuts and everything is homemade.  The sauce is so yummy.  Nice chunks of tomatoes.  You can tell the zucchini sticks were hand cut and breaded right then and there.  Not all uniformly shaped like they dug them out of a bag in the freezer.  Beef Barley soup was full of chunky pieces of meat and vegetables.  If you like spicy then you have to get the Spicy wrap which consisted of boar's head cajun turkey, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and avocado.  It was a huge wrap too!  So fresh and filling.  Yes, I said fresh again.  Can't help it!!  Everything really was!  You also get a huge hero with meat piled on for about $6.50.  Even though this was my first experience with Fresco, I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with anything you'll get from here.  Can't wait until I'm in Ridgewood again so I can order me some more good eats!",0.0
"Wow - just wow....

I'm a pessimist - I'm a cynic - I'm a grouch.

I hate yuppies. I hate hipsters. I hate foodies.

I really hate what the nightclub mafia has done to our neighborhood in the past decade.

I'm skeptical about ""healthy options"", ""fusion cuisines"", and pretty much anything marketed as ""modern"" or ""efficient"".

High praise for me for food options around here is ""pretty good for the hood"", ""Inwood adequate"", etc. Basically if it tastes ok, doesn't make us sick, and isn't a front for money laundering clubs it's probably as much as we can hope for.

Until this place.....

I'd heard that the original Pick and Eat was supposed to be really good. But I figured that was ""really good compared to..."", ""alright for the neighborhood"", ""ok if you stay away from the...."", etc....

No.....

Pick and Eat is awesome. Pick and Eat is delicious. Pick and Eat is the best thing to open around here in the 21 years I've lived in Inwood.

Pick and Eat isn't just good by local standards. It's insanely delicious by any standard.

So far we've had garden burgers, salads, quesadillas, pizzas, and soup. Everything has been unbelievably good. Everything has been extremely fresh. The recipes are all Dominican/Latino influenced and a lot of the combinations are not things I'd naturally think of as going together (like maduros on pizza) - but everything we've tried so far works perfectly. None of it tastes like an experiment. Whoever created these recipes is brilliant.

The whole place and menu are obvious labors of love. Everything is set up to allow maximum choice and allow substitutions of anything for anything. The ingredients are primarily healthy and everything is labeled so that people can plan their diets easily. Ordering is computerized and the kitchen is extremely efficient.

Staff are exceptional. Everyone we've encountered there has been extremely nice, fluent in both English and Spanish, and extremely efficient. Everything seems to be functioning very smoothly despite being very busy and only open a few weeks.

Just can't say enough positive about this place. My usual yelp reviews are five lines long, but no amount of praise could do this place justice. If there is any justice in this world, this place will not only be a huge success but will multiply. Once it gets on grubhub and/or gets its own web ordering up it will be unstoppable. No joke - if I had any money and this place went public I'd buy all the stock I could . It's _that_ good and _that_ unique.

Thank you thank you thank you Pick and Eat!",0.0
"There are better Jewish delis (kosher and non-kosher) scattered throughout the 5 boroughs. Just because it's kosher doesn't mean it's good eats. That being said, I've been to several Mendy's throughout the city and surprisingly I have never had a satisfactory meal. Here are some of my findings:
* Chicken soup (with or without matzo) - It was winter, snowing, and I was getting sick. I walked into Mendy's wanting soup. I assumed it would be good, I mean what could possibly go wrong with chicken soup, right? This soup was very, very, very salty and had absolutely no chicken flavor. The broth color resembles urine, and I suspect they're using artificial color. And, oddly enough, it's greasy! How does one make a chicken soup completely devoid of flavor (other than the salt) AND greasy? At least the matzoh balls were edible.
* Pastrami sandwich (on rye with mustard) - I admit, it's hard to go wrong with pastrami, but Mendy's manages to slice it too thin and too greasy - they don't slice to order - and it ends up being tough, greasy and stringy, not tender. The rye bread (not seeded) was OK, and it's only purpose was to soak up the globs of grease from the pastrami. The best part of the sandwich was the deli mustard (spicy and sour).
* Turkey sandwich (on rye with lettuce, tomatoes, onion and Russian dressing) - It was a fair approximation of a kosher deli turkey sandwich, except for that the turkey was not roasted fresh. They used a ""Boars-Head"" type turkey breast - completely unacceptable and inedible. 
* Brisket sandwich (on rye with mustard) - I've eaten steamed cardboard that was better. No flavor whatsoever. Tough, stringy, leathery.
* Chopped liver - I've had better and I have worse. Since it was in the the non-memorable category, I'll give it the benefit of a doubt and state it was just OK.
* Salad - I admit, I should have seen this coming. As a rule one does not wander into a place known for sandwiches and ask for a salad, but there was a line of customers getting salad. So I figured it would probably be OK. The salad was absolute crap: it poorly prepared with very little lettuce, way too many onions (and I love onions), and meat (roast beef) that looked like it had been leftover from WWII. To make matters worse, the idiot behind the counter completely screwed up my order: I asked for balsamic vinaigrette, he gave me balsamic vinegar.

"Picture yourself sitting in coach on a domestic flight.  Now imagine the sandwich that you might be able to purchase onboard, probably for around $6-$8.  This sandwich is edible, it's probably not going to make you sick...but it's definitely not good.

Was there anything unsatisfying about that hypothetical experience?

If your answer was ""yes, I wish I had paid $16 for that SAME sandwich!"" then you will LOVE dining at EAT.

If your answer was pretty much anything else, then you should eat elsewhere.

Yes, the UES is pricey, but for the amount you'd spend at EAT, there are a lot of places where you can actually enjoy delicious food.",0.0
"This is a great addition to the neighborhood, they have all the ingredients for success packed into a small cafe. Being sick over the weekend I quickly learned there is a lack of options as far as fresh juices go but I remembered this place had opened. The staff was knowledgeable and able to make a quick recommendation based on my sinus infection that was delicious and pack with vitamin C. The only issue I have is that they do not have their own juice blend options as part of their menu. Something for immunity, colds, congestion, or protein would be a great decision for indecisive customers or those going for something specific. Making your own juice is always a good option but a few recommended blends would be perfect.",0.0
"I don't get what the hype is about this gelato place. They were incredibly stingy in their tastings, offering only samples one-fourth of the amount at other gelato shops. I felt that the two flavors I tried were way too sweet and wanted to try another flavor. I was then told (with an attitude no less) that I was limited to only two tastings. That left a bad taste in my mouth.
I instead opted for a random flavor that I couldn't try. Again, the gelato was sickeningly sweet. The consistency was also more like cheap ice cream and started melting even before I left the shop. I suspect the temperature setting was off. 
Overall, it was a bad experience. Will not go back again. So many more better gelato places to choose from in the area.",0.0
"The cupcakes are very moist and not too sweet. Even the frosting was just right. The banana bread pudding was an absolute must. Also not too overwhelming. I thought at first it may be too thick, and sickening after a few bites, but was the complete opposite.

"Absolutely LOVE this place! Good price for good sushi if you're a big eater! My bf and I come here once a week (lunch/dinner varies) during our summer vacation. It is easy to get to where I live. The space could be bigger, but it's not really a bother to maneuver around the restaurant. 
When it comes to timing, you just have to know when to go. Be prepared during lunchtime and dinner time on Friday's and Saturday's for it to be super packed. Bigger groups wait a pretty long time to be seated. Service is usually quick and the food is pretty fresh. Getting the soup udon is a good for settling your stomach at the end when you're sick from eating all that sushi. It is certainly a good choice if you're just hungry to stuff your face with sushi!",0.0
"I have been with Peapod for about 9 years? It has become so bad.  Always a call saying that delivery will be late for two hours. Sometimes they come after the call with missing food, spoiled chicken, broken gallon of water all over the front of my door, it's unbelievable. So sick of trying to call customer service. Have been on the phone for hours at times waiting for someone to pick up. They might as well go out of business since now their customer service is only open till 3:30 PM on Saturdays. Unreal, when their are still missing deliveries out their.  Forget about emailing them, there is no one that responds.  Me...going back to Fresh Direct exclusively.  Waiting at home for Peapod to come on Saturday night, forget it. Going out and ordering Fresh Direct for tomorrow. OUTRAGEOUS, JUST OUTRAGEOUS. The guys who deliver tell me they are run ragged and don't get reimbursed to drive out to the warehouse. Peapod, no more. I loved Peapod for several years, no more love left for you.",0.0
"If this place was called ""The Whole Shitty Attitude"", it would get a 5 star rating for sure. I'm honestly shocked this place as such a high Yelp review. It's not that it has awful food (I wouldn't know despite massive pressure to be able to tell you), or bad drinks, but the service is just the absolute worst. I've never written a negative Yelp review before, but I feel an obligation after a few really poor experiences here. 

About 40 of us roll into the bar at once after our corporate outing, so understandably the staff is a little overwhelmed, but you would think they would at least attempt to be half polite since we're spending an enormous amount of money in their bar. Wrong. They were not only 'not polite', they were flat out rude. Our group is genuinely a nice, well-mannered group of people, but they acted like we just walked in and demanded free drinks and Nickelback spotify. The bartender repeatedly barked at people who were trying to get drinks and looked annoyed any time anyone had an order. She barked at me to not block the servers way, and I apologized and politely moved out of the way. Then someone else from the group came up to grab a drink not realizing he was in the hot zone, and got yelled at by a server. A simple, ""please don't stand here"" works. 

A third of the group decided to move outside to their patio to give a little space to the indoor patrons and staff and were immediately told we couldn't be out there. It was completely empty except for two small tables against the back. They said that the patio was reserved for people who were actually going to eat, despite the fact that neither table already out there had food or remnants of food. We politely offered to leave immediately if someone wanted to sit out there to eat, and got an eye roll. The hostess then huffed and puffed to the front, and came charging back with ""Reserved"" signs. She angrily said ""Excuse me"" in the most rude tone I've probably ever experienced in my vast experience at NYC drinking establishments and literally sighed and groaned as she walked by. I want to bear in mind that we are not a rowdy crowd, we are sitting/standing outside on the empty patio chatting quietly and having beers. She then went to grab a chair and one of the men in our group leaned over to help her grab it and she snapped at him ""I can get the chair!"" and pulled it away from him. So over the top. I started to actually question if I had gone so far West that I was actually living in an alternate universe where people pay you to drink at their bars. 

Then another hostess/server came out and said we really couldn't be out there unless we were ordering food. I want to point out that we're not sitting back there taking up space and potential checks. We're ordering multiple rounds of drinks in a place that would otherwise be empty. Again, we said the second someone wanted to walk back there, we'd head inside, but that we were blocking the servers way inside and wanted to give them some space. I then attempted to compromise by asking half of our group that was out there to head back inside so that we were only taking up one precious eating table. 

Even though no one ever came for the tables, I ended up feeling so uncomfortable sitting out there with everyone huffing and puffing and eyeing us like patio terrorists, that I told the remaining 4 people out there to head inside. We did and were immediately met with snappy attitudes and shoves aside, so we gave up. For the amount of money we spent, and how polite we were, I'm mind-boggled at the experience. We headed to Jake's Saloon one avenue over on 23rd and 9th, where there was just one bartender who took the influx of people like a champ, got our orders out quicker, and at least pretended that he enjoyed paying his rent.

There was one dude out back who was relatively chill once he realized we weren't d-bags, so I'll give him credit, and that patio would be a sick brunch spot, if by chance they hire an entirely new staff that has an ounce of customer service acumen.",0.0
"My first visit to Bento was alright. The spicy tuna roll has cucumber in it, I appreciate the greens but another local spot puts scallions in their spicy tuna and I like that more. Nothing to complain about there. The ambience at Bento is good, it's a rather bright lunch spot with loud generic pop music, a non offensive choice, and wi-Fi (which is awesome and worth five stars by itself). I just came back for a spicy tuna samurai combo, for which $9.79 w/tax isn't bad, but the sushi was. I ate the two salmon nigiri ok, then started on the tuna ones. The first felt funny and the slice of fish fell off the top and had to be eaten separately. That's never happened before and it definitely tasted funny. There were four spicy tuna rolls in the combo as well and two tasted fresh and delicious but the other two, along with the tuna nigiri just tasted fishy... You know what I'm talking about. How fresh fish has such a delicate flavor and old fish tastes like bacterial vaginosis. I had to leave one nigiri uneaten, which sucks as I was hungry. Upon reading previous yelp reviews I'm now hoping I don't get food poisoning from this. *fingers crossed*

A colleague of mine eats here once a week and loves it. I wish I hadn't had the misfortune to pick up a piece of bad fish. It's a longer walk but I'll be going to the Japanese grocery store for my sushi from now on.",0.0
"Keen's is one of my handful of ""go-to"" places in Manhattan, especially when someone comes to visit from out-of-town.  It has great, personable service and terrific food, and you can't beat that awesome 7-minute free tour, with all of its history and quirkiness.  It's also interesting, but odd, how many in-the-know NYers I know/meet who have never even heard of Keen's.

I've been going to Keen's for years and have never sat at a table.  They have a full bar including about 150 single-malt Scotches, if that's your thing.  The bartenders give great service, are personable and clever/funny and will remember you, even if you've only met them once and haven't been to the bar in 6 months.  The bar food is excellent and much cheaper than the menu in the dining room (I recommend the filet mignon skewer at about $18).  Make sure to sit at the actual bar where the bartender is (and not on the bar rail against the opposite wall where you're, um, facing a wall).  If you go between 6:30-8, the bar will likely be packed but give it 10-15 minutes and you'll get a seat as people get seated for their reservation.

Also, you should speak to the person sitting on the bar stool next to you.  I've never NOT met a fascinating person at Keen's bar (though, obviously, you have to be interested in people to find a conversational spark).  One time I met an engineer who helps keep NYC's water clean and, when asked, explained to us how it is that terrorists cannot kill NYC's population by poisoning our water supply. (I loved that conversation but, for those who wouldn't, there are plenty of non-geeky, fascinating people at Keen's.) 

As for the history and quirkiness, ask the host/hostess for the (7-minute) free tour of the joint.  You'll hear the story about the 45,000 clay smoking pipes hanging from the ceiling, see a stuffed bull moose shot by Teddy Roosevelt, and some unbelievable items from 1865 related to President Lincoln's assassination.",0.0
"Bad customer service, employees working with a cold (sick), and the food isn't all the great. This morning I walked in to order a breakfast sandwhich, and right after I placed my order I noticed that the cook was sneezing, his eyes were watery and his face was red: he was coming down with a cold, no doubt. I squirmed, but felt bad not paying for the wrap I had just ordered, so I bought it anyway. When I was about to pay, I took out a $20 and the cashier, whom I think is also the manager/owner, gave me an attitude because I didn't have exact change--she ALWAYS gives me an attitude about something. She then gave me my change very rudely, and didn't even say thank you. I've worked in customer service before, theirs suck! Never ever going back to this place!",0.0

"Watawa used to be my favorite spot for sushi in Astoria. I've been going there for almost ten years now and have always been a loyal customer even as their quality has steadily declined over the years. The last time I had their lunch special it gave me food poisoning. I convinced myself it was just a one-time mistake on their part but today I ordered an eel avocado hand roll to-go from Watawa and it was full of BONES. Of all the sushi meals I've ever had, I've literally never found bones in any one of them. I was completely disgusted. What was worse was Watawa's response when I brought it to their attention - they weren't at all apologetic and asked what I wanted them to do. Are you kidding me?! It's a shame but you'll never see me eating at Watawa again. I recommend Aji sushi if you're in the area - much cleaner restaurant, fresher food and much nicer staff.",0.0
"The day has come. The new bridge and tunnel is the Manhattanite who crosses the Manhattan Bridge for nights out in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.  And if there is a single bar that could be responsible for this phenomenon, it is Casablanca Cocktail Lounge. The bar proves what all of us 30-plus something, aging, sick of the scene, bridge and tunnel types don't take for granted. Being kind will warm your soul, make you a better person and get you across the bridge. These principles can indeed live in a bar and if there is any bar that lives up to this kind of standard, it is Casablanca Cocktail Lounge. Shouldn't ""nice"" be just a really nice way to spend one's down time? I think so.  This spot has an amazing vibe, good drinks, friendly bartenders and killer DJs. It's a true gem that gives this Bridge and Tunneler a reason to cross a bridge at midnight and then again on my way home at 4 am.",0.0
"Probably one of the most vile supermarkets in Manhattan. It starts with a check in that requires you to pass the Key Food mafioso (sometimes representing themselves with badges but seriously.. i've found better badges at the bottom of a cereal packet. ) 

So.. declare all your bags as the sausage stealing ingrate you've already been tagged as. But move on quietly to the shopping carts that haven't been cleaned since David Dinkins was mayor and you're sure to feel scuzzed out before you've even seen the butter aisle. But let's move down..mmm .. what is that scent in the meat section? yes that would be the freshly sprayed bleach wash. You really don't get to taste it unless you buy some pre packaged goods from their meat section... it's all great.. until you cook it and it has ..that taste.. you know the taste of a freshly bleached chicken. PS watch the chicken labeling.. it's all torn off and replaced with new sell by dates. 

But I digress.. never ever ever ever buy anything from here that isn't sealed with the original manufacturer. They're not butchers, bakers, or dealers of anything that requires fresh. Let's zoom through the market now.. pastas, soups, canned goods are perfect .. as long as none of the vile staff has had the chance to put their fingers on it. sure the deli section people are nice but it's just your slices rammed through a machine that just made someone else's slices. They're not happy to serve you..they don't care if you have a nice day ( I only say that because there are butchers and deli owners that build a relationship with the locals)  these guys couldn't care if you left/laughed/moved on..Now look at the contained salads and ""things""..There isn't one dish in that deli section that any normal resident could possibly consume without  vomiting. At the end of your fabulous shopping journey you're met with the shittiest broken and run down cashiers to hit Detroit... if you want a macaroni salad ..go to fairway where it is mad fresh instead of the shit pavilion it was pushed through to key food..it's gross.

oh wait It's not Detroit because they're actually working at being a better city, it's the UPPER EAST SIDE where you're treated like a Detroit shop lifter. The staff are vile, the food is vile, the management is even worse and propagate their lack of knowledge with violent threats if you choose to argue. They're not very clever and god forbid you encounter a situation that requires something more than a third grade tiimeout and they won't know what to do. Oh and please push down your merchandise as nothing works.
YOU have MUCH better options. Associated on 96th and lex is the best price with best turnover.also on 101 and 2nd.. gristedes is only good for emergencies because of high prices but at least they're happy to see you .. The Rite aid and Duane Reades have become better and cheaper soda staples. Go back to Fairway for good stuff and soon we'll have whole foods on 3rd

"Over all, I'm glad this place exists. 

Before I get to the good and bad, I want to discuss the rudeness that's commonly mentioned. I personally don't find them to be rude. I can understand why others have written that though.

It is true that the stocking people sometimes block the isle, but I haven't noticed it to be worse than the Whole Foods. If you look unhappy they'll usually move out of your way more than the Whole Foods people, who just ignore you. 

The sales people don't smile a big smile at you or make small chat (though some of them do). To me this ins't rude. To some people, it is. If you engage them in conversation they seem happy to talk to you. They probably won't give you a huge smile though, and this doesn't bother me. 

My goal in a store is to be efficient and just buy stuff. I'm not there to get my dose of friendlies for the day, so I don't take this personally, because it's how they treat everyone. If you talk to the cashier's, they're typically quite nice and helpful. They've always seemed fair to me, and they ring you up quickly -- which I prefer over chat.

They just don't smile a big American smile at you, which I don't have any problem with. Some people do have a problem with that. I also do like the friendly attitudes at Whole Foods, but sometimes they take forever to bag things up. 

Quite a while back, I also saw a celebrity here also! I'm 99% sure I saw Zack Braff! The guy from Scrubs :). It looked exactly like him, so I'm more like 100% sure, but I like to leave that room for error haha. 

The good:

Celebrities shop here (see above, haha). 

I've run in here several times when I felt I was coming down with something, bought some type of supplement or natural remedy (I'm really into this stuff) and ended up not needing to go to the doctor or getting sick at all. They have those rarer health items perfect for this purpose. 

If you ask for help in the vitamin section (by the registers), they always helped me find the products and no one acted annoyed. Again, some of the items are marked up higher than I'm willing to pay, others are reasonable. 

I've asked questions about the products, and was satisfied with the answers. 

I was happy to see some good prices on (some) of the alternative flours. Their baking section could use some more items, but they do have Sweet Leaf Stevia, Millet flour, Coconut flour, etc. 

Great natural shampoo and personal care section (without evil chemicals) make-up without chemicals, etc. Chamomile shampoo! 

Nice selection of berry juice concentrates without added sugar. Such as blueberry, cranberry, etc. You can mix with stevia to make a healthy juice without sugar. 

There is a wide selection of teas but I'd like to see it expanded. The essential oils are too pricy for me, but the incense is a decent price. 

They have puffed millet! Steel cut oatmeal. Kimchi and sourkrout that isn't pasteurized (this stuff is like downing a $35 jar of probiotics, per bite). Greek yogurt, organic cheese, etc. 

They sell food grade hydrogen peroxide, which you can use to wash vegetables (please google this and learn to properly handle it, as it can severely burn you!) but I was thrilled to see they stocked it, because I'd never seen it in any stores before. 

The bad:

Sometimes the prices will be double the going price for a product. You really need to know what the typical prices are. Sometimes, a product might be cheaper, or the going rate. Not everything is more expensive. I did see a face cream that I saw only for half price was listed at twice the price. 

I don't go here for my regular grocery items, but for hard-to-find things, like more unusual items. They have a small section of produce and dairy. I got a green juice one day, and it was good. 

They might not have every item the regular store does. I didn't see horse radish, for instance. 

I'd like to see more baking items, such as plain 0% sugar baker's chocolate, but they have a good selection of flavorings and spices.",0.0
"Something is Roti in the state of Queens.



When I was playing a concert in Minneapolis, I had all my stuff lifted in and out of the venue by a ""Twin City Roadie."" I really appreciated him. I hit on him, but he was not interested. I'll never forget the way his big roadie hands grasped my Casio keyboard. This place is named after him.



What to get: Excellent Doubles, Amazing Peanut Punch

What else: Please don't punch my peanuts



This restaurant contains all kinds of delicacies from the Trin Citi region of the USA. Minneapolis and St. Paul. Such as Pimento Burgers and freezing cold temperatures and snow. Yes, you can find it all h... wait, what's that? It's Caribbean food? OK never mind. Ignore me.



The US Women's Soccer team loves getting food here. Probably because they always Win-citi Roti.



I came here just minutes before they were due to close. It was dead quiet and in a supposedly sketchy neighborhood (I really don't think it is) late at night, and they didn't have to even give me the time of day. However they gave me more than the time of day and earned themselves a 5-star rating in the process.



They sold me - for next to nothing, no less - one of the best doubles I've had. Only Royal Bakery on Nostrand and maybe Michelle's in Buffalo have better doubles (of the ones I've tried). Absolute deliciousness. Loved every nibble. Nice and spicy too (I always ask for extra spicy).



By the way, they also do haircuts, and they're changing their name to Trimciti Roti.



If you don't know what a Doubles is, then here:



A doubles (it's always plural, even when it's singular) is a soft puffy kind of pita-ish pastry that is more doughy and not at all flaky... it's squidgy. It's filled with chick peas and spices and sauce, and topped with very hot sauce - but not hot sauce as you know it, child. I always ask for extra hot sauce so it blows my head off. So to speak. Wink wink.



They are a very happy bunch of people, for sure, hence the name, Grinciti Roti.



I saw some weird light brown liquid behind them, so instead of assuming someone had got very sick or that there was some underground European gross porn being made, I asked them what it was. Peanut Punch! Yeah right, I said. I know peanuts, and those, sir, are not peanuts. Oh wait. It's in a punch. Okay. Now I get it.



The people that own it are wrestlers. Which is why they named it Pinciti Roti.



I don't even like peanuts. But I took a plunge and I got a peanut f***ing punch. It's like a rabbit punch but less painful. Oh my goodness! This drink was out of this freaking world people. It tasted like home made peanut butter milkshake but with a nicer, smoother consistency. I loved every drop of it. I can't believe I'm saying that. Usually there's only one kind of milky drink I like and it comes from my boyfriend.



Michael J Fox comes here. So much so that they are considering renaming it Spinciti Roti.



So the bottom line is, get yourself to Trincity Roti and try some of their stuff. Next time I'm here, I'm going for the Roti, baby. I Roti these guys a letter but they have yet to respond. And before I make the drive back to Queens I must remember to Rotiate my tires.



What's that darling? You can't feel it? Well I'm pretty sure it's in-citi Roti. Maybe it's just not large enough for you? It's okay, I have this problem a lot. It's not you, it's me. Well actually it's U2. Thinking of Bono and Adam Clayton making out always makes it shrivel up and yet I can't get that image out of my brain. I'm sorry.

"I came here for my anniversary on the recommendation of one of my friends who was raving about how amazing his food was from here. Never have I ever been so disapointed by food and the restaurant manager in my life. 

I made reservations and mentioned it was our anniversary and requested a booth table ahead of time. The restuarant had maybe 10 guests tops and we were given major attitude by the manager on the floor when we were not happy with the table near the cash register in what was a pretty empty restaurant. At this point I was ready to leave and they wanted to just put us at the bar/lounge although there were 4 booths and an almost empty restaurant. I said no and she reluctantly gave us the booth and told us we needed to leave by 8 because that table was reserved for some ceo. 

Personally I don't care if the Pope himself was coming don't talk to me like I am less important then someone who had reservations 3 hours later than me. Then talk to my husband who was fine with anything and not ask me who was clearly upset. Really awful start to what was supposed to be a romantic night out away from the kids. 

I ordered oysters to start, these were actually really good...the only good item really. We also had Wagyu meatballs which were ok they weren't amazing as the reviews make them out to be. For dinner I ordered the dry aged ny strip. Probably the worst steak I have ever had in my life. Burnt to a crisp, completely charred on the outside. My husband had the bowery steak ordered medium rare and was burnt to a crisp as well. Tasted like mystery meat with salsa Verde dumped on top. We were famished when we arrived so we still ate it and feared the staff would probably spit in our food cutting around the burnt pieces.

We didn't want dessert at this point and just wanted to get out of there. 

This was probably one of the most dreadful experiences I have ever had at a restaurant, so poorly managed. Completely dissapointed. The waiter we had was great ...nothing else ...even the freebies sucked! If this was my restuarant I would have been mortified that any of my guests who are dropping a couple hundred dollars were treated and fed this way...

Would never recommend... run run run! The only benefit of the doubt I can give is that maybe their real chef called out sick that day 8/1 or something, and maybe this was a substitute manager. This is a huge inconsistency to my friends recommendation and the other recommendations on here. Regardless this was my true experience.",0.0
"Bistango was one of the first gluten free pasta places in NYC with good food and that did not get me sick.  Its so nice to go into places that actually know what gluten is.

The ambience feels kind of casual even though they put out candles in the evening and dim the lights.  The food is so good that I journeyed from the upper east side after 10pm one night on a bicycle just to get there gluten free spinach & feta stuffed ravioli pasta in a creamy white sauce to go.

The dilemma to all of this is that I did not have a chain for my bike and by the time I got there at 10:30pm, the restaurant was starting to close.  One of the servers told the manager that I was outside desperate to order.  The manager was so nice that he had the servers leave one of the outdoor tables and chairs for me to stay with my bike while they made my food.  They gave me warm gluten free bread with water while I waited near the side entrance and they checked on me from time to time.

I always have good service when I eat inside but this was them going above and beyond.  I love the food and the flour-less cake is to die for.  This is the perfect spot for food, cocktails, and dessert completely gluten free.",0.0

"This place makes me happy. 

This place has authentic Brazilian food and service. It's hard to find good and authentic Brazilian food in this city. 

Cheers to Guaraná Antarctica, because that's the best one and every Brazilian's favorite. The pão de queijo is wonderful, although no one in Brazil would ever pay that much for 6 little bites. The coxinhas are very good too, also a bit pricey for the portion. WORTH IT. Home sickness beats monthly food budget. 

OMG the caipirinhas are a must. Love the guava & caju ones. They use Cachaça Leblon. Very authentic and delicious. 

The picanha entree was amazing too. The entree portions are pretty large. The food takes a while to come out. The service is lovely,but also a bit slow for the city's standard. Do come here with friends so you won't notice the wait. 

Take a seat in the back, because it's cozier and start downing caipirinhas. Wish they had good happy hour deals because everyday should be caipirinha day.",0.0
"You wouldn't expect that the guy behind The Meatball Shop could turn out a great seafood joint, but surprise surprise!

I like the open, airy space of the restaurant. Even when it's crowded (and believe me, it will be no matter what), it feels spacious. We managed to grab one of the last tables available. The server was friendly and took the time to explain the menu for us, which was good because it's kind of confusing.

Their thing is fresh seafood from LI, so they serve whatever the catch is that day, which is  indicated on a wall in the back with these cute fish signs and orange spoons. We decided to split the tuna poke and some tacos. The poke was very fresh and dressed with an interesting mix of peanuts, avocado, cucumber, onion, and some other things. Delicious and pretty good size portion. We chose the crispy dogfish and spicy squid tacos. Even though there were only two of each order, I'm rather impressed by the portion sizes. The dogfish tacos were my favorite of the two. Crispy, well-breaded fillets with guacamole and chipotle mayo. The squid tacos were good as well, but the flavor of the squid was kind of jarring, sort of spicy and sickly sweet. I liked the corn nuts added for crunch though.

The server talked us into getting their only and only dessert, a kaffir lime ice cream (lactose free! yes!) with toasted coconut on top. It came in a cute cone. Needless to say, I loved it.

Definitely a place worth checking out if you can get in.",0.0
"The food is good, but expensive and they only mostly serve PORK with like hot dogs, and hamburgers turkey and ri tip as an exception.  being outsde when its nice  is fun. but its too hot disgusting n humid to be chowing down  pounds of meant.. while seating ,  theres also tons of kids running around almost  running into people. Also the port o potties are DISGUSTING and unsanitary , the kids piss all over the seats and i saw one port o potty leaking into a puddle of piss on the ground..  my appetite is shot after having to pee over piles of other peoples diarrhea. just not my thing....   nothing to say about the food, but the kids , the heat, and the pissy portopottys are  RANK and unsanitary! but i'd totally come back, mostly for the BAR!
Please consider normal bathrooms?  no one wants to sit on piss covered seats or step in urine. just a thought.. Hope you guys get normal bathrooms at some point  because poop +piss don't mean business especially when youre drinking and dreading having to go into that filthy plastic shit collecting box while you step in puddles o pee...

"I used to come here every day. The best cheese danish ever!  But after 2 years of having cheese danish for breakfast I got bored. Lately it seemed like the cheese is different ( not in a good way). But when I think about it,  maybe I ate it so much that I got sick of the taste.
American cheese cake with strawberries on the top... Perfection!  The best ever.  And the cannolis are pretty good. ( the plain ones only,  the chocolate ones are too much). 
Service is ok. They got a lot of new girls lately,  I liked the some other girls that left a lot more.

"Ridiculous private messages between the owner, Andrew, and me, after he left his public comment.

Me:
1. I don't buy your BS about your wifi system. Why doesn't every other coffee shop use Webbeams if that's the case? And what does a two-hour time limit have to do with enforcing piracy laws?

2. Hamilton Heights may now be an ""artist enclave,"" but at the expense of long-time neighborhood residents who were here long before you and your coffee shop. I'd rather see people be able to afford their rent than have cutesy, overpriced coffee shops available. Do yourself a favor and google ""gentrification."" You may learn something.

3. Finally, your bad attitude is astounding. You should take a crash course is customer service. You make yourself and your business look bad by accusing me of having ""disdain"" for my ""neighbors."" By the way, dude, these AREN'T my neighbors. I don't live in Hamilton Heights, thank you very freaking much.

Andrew:
Well I'm sorry you think our reasoning for our wifi codes are BS. I don't know how other shops deal with it but this is how we deal with it. 
You should learn about who is really responsible for gentrification and back off accusing small business owners for it. Frankly I'm sick and tired of new transplants like yourself getting on your high horse and throwing that tripe around. You only direct your ire at small businesses because we are a much easier target than the lecherous landlords and corporate big wigs with franchises like Starbucks willing to pay crazy rent out there jacking up everyone's rent including ours. 
I'm sure you'll have a great time at Starbucks in whatever neighborhood you've decided to make your new home since moving here from Seattle and tell yourself you have no part in the gentrification of that neighborhood by living there. 
People like you make yelp a toxic place.
Good day.

Go for it! I'm not a business owner, so I have no stake in this fight. You're just making yourself look immature and petty.


What this business owner fails to understand is that Yelp is a public forum that evaluates businesses, not Yelp users. My only stake in this fight is retaining my credibility as a Yelper, which means very little to me since I have no profit to gain here. His stake is much greater, and his failure to demonstrate basic principles of customer service is illustrative of his short-sightedness and hot headedness. When a business owner calls a customer names, it's indicative of a greater problem with the way the business is run.",0.0
"This bar is very different than its sister bar in LES. It's much bigger and much cheaper for one thing, also it is crawling with hipsters. 

This first time I ever visited this location was a one star experience. It was around 1am on a Saturday night. Super crowded, drunk people everywhere, I mean that's what you expect from a bar on a Saturday night. It did take a while to get my drink, just a beer nothing fancy, but again super busy Saturday night. The reason I did not enjoy my experience here was the bathrooms... one was out of commission and the other one should have been as well. After waiting in line for ten minutes I open the door to see a vomit covered floor, used toilet paper behind the toilet, vomit in the clogged toilet and the toilet seat was on the floor. Was I suppose to use the bathroom here? Well I didn't, I chugged my beer and left. Now that is not the staff's fault, but still they had to of known about it. 

My second experience was not as bad. When my date said he wanted to make his way over there, I literally just wanted to yell no I'm going home now, don't make me go back to the place with the bathroom of my nightmares. Well I am glad I went back. It was a Sunday night, not as crowded, I had a few Jack and Cokes, they were good. Oh and the bathroom was spotless. 

Overall I'm going to say this is an average bar, nothing too crazy. It did have outside seating and a pool table though which was neat.",0.0
"The worst buffet experience of my life!!!!! 
Just came out of this place.

First off the parking lot smells so bad.  It smells like there's garbage everywhere and someone dumped all of over place. Yuck!

We first walked into the buffet and the waiter took our drink order.. the cups werent washed properly so it smelled very fishy. Alllll of the food was very mediocre and there was no lobster as we though there would be from the advertisement.  We asked one server if there was and he pointed out that there was.  When we asked another guy because we couldnt find it, the guy just laughed and said ""tomorrow"" when i was told lobsters are only for weekends. Get your stories straight! Im just praying i dont get food poison from this place.

**There was a beef station where we went to get a slice of meat and my bf got a slice of FAT and asked if he can have a different piece and the spanish guy just says to him.. ""one piece per person"".. so we tell him ok then take this piece of FAT back and give us a slice of meat and he starts cursing in spanish and gives a hand gesture to leave. WTF?! We walked away to not have a stupid confrontation with him.  Moments later we hear him arguing (very loudly) with another customer. The manager was called but it had seemed like the manager was not helping the situation but was arguing with the customer as well.

Fyi there is an automatic 15% gratuity added on to your bill.  Must be why most of the servers are such a**holes. They know that they get tip no matter how much of an a**hole you are to paying customers

"***CASH ONLY***

I thought about subtracting half a star just for its difficulty to get a table (both walk-in and to make a reservation) and another half a star for its higher prices (after all, ramen was originally made to be an extra affordable cuisine for..well, people who can't afford pricey food). Ironically, the ""trend"" that ramen has become allows places like Mu Ramen to up their prices, have fancier decor, more elaborate menu items, and the worst... OUTRAGEOUS waits to be sat! However, I am still compelled to give this place 5 stars for a multitude of reasons. 

First, Mu Ramen is currently my favorite ramen house in NYC. Coming from someone who regularly dreams of ramen, this actually says a lot. Let's just say, I have a couple t-shirts exclaiming my undying infatuation for ramen. I can honestly eat a good bowl of ramen every other day and not get sick of it. 

I have already gone to Mu Ramen 4 different times and each time has been a different experience, so I'll share them all.

1st time I went was with my boyfriend. They were all booked up. I never knew ramen houses took reservations (most do not), so naturally I was upset, heartbroken, disappointed, hangry, the whole works, especially because of how the restaurant is arranged. There's plenty of room with not enough seating. They certainly did not utilize their space very well. They can definitely seat double, if not triple what they're set up for. The only explanations I can possibly think of are 1) perhaps they want to continue to be that high in demand for a long time by lacking seats and 2) they do not want to take a large number of covers to keep the quality of the product high. Both are reasonable justifications on the interior arrangement. Anywho, the hostess/server explained we should call ahead next time after 3pm in the afternoon and make a reservation for that day in advance. So basically we left with that one tip of info and empty bellies. 

2nd time around I, of course, called ahead. After multiple attempts at getting through on the phone, I finally got seating for 2 and took one of my gal pals. With all the hype on this place I was ready to splurge. She and I started with the U&I bowl (one each), the foie gras stuffed chicken (gyoza), and I had the spicy miso and she had the tonkatsu ramen. The food was nothing short of AMAZING. 
-The U&I bowl is outrageously good. I was told people are complaining about the price. Wake up people! Uni is rare and expensive. The price on that dish is a steal. The restaurant loses money by charging that low. If you think it's overpriced, don't order it and stop complaining about it. You're ruining it for everyone else who understands how this works!
-The gyoza. WOW. Must-try. Very unique and delicious. 
-The ramen. DOUBLE WOW. Noodles are cooked to perfection, not soggy and has the right amount of bite. The spicy miso already comes with amazing corn. I hate having to pay $1-2 more for a few kernels of corn. It also comes with my favorite type of ramen noodle, the thick wavy noodles. Thank you Mu Ramen for serving your miso ramen with the proper style of noodle and corn! The tonkatsu is fantastic if you're not really the spicy food type. The broth is rich and you can truly appreciate the pork bone flavor. The thin noodles go perfectly. Both broths were not too salty, not too oily, and full of excellent flavor!
The con: After ordering that much food, a beer each and sharing a bottle of sake, the bill was fairly large. Especially for a Japanese ramen joint. 
*However, we happily paid and tipped our amazing waiter generously. He was awesome. Totally worth it. 

I had such an amazing culinary experience the 2nd time, so I HAD to bring my boyfriend on my 3rd time. I was raving for weeks about everything I had. I explained to him about the U&I bowl and unfortunately, AS I was talking about it, the server brought to our attention that they were out of the U&I. I shrieked! What a bummer. Just punch me in the face instead why don't you :( but the overall experience was still wonderful. Great food. Great service. Such a great place in general. 

4th time, now that this is officially my favorite ramen house, and ramen being my top 5 foods in the world, my boyfriend decided to surprise me and make a reservation for our Valentine's Day. We were lucky enough to sit at the bar and watch all the action! We even met the owner, Joshua, and he was super cool. He shared with us the joys and struggles of running the place and was super hospitable. We exchanged restaurant industry stories (my boyfriend and I both being in the same industry) and had a great time chit chatting. 

*Their beer selection is unlike any other! They are all imported from Japan and I guarantee most of them you've never heard of or tried before, which is a beer drinker's delight in my book. 
*They have good sake
*Their wine is so-so

"Starting to get sick and was in the need of some nice hot sul-lung tang to help my body recover faster... I don't think my taste bud have disappeared quite yet but their soup was so bland. I kept adding more salt thinking that was the problem... but the noodles were soggier than I would have liked and there was just something missing. Kimchi wasn't the most amazing either. I would have expected more since I love the one in the city... I could get better Suhl-Lung Tang and for cheaper at many other places...
My friend wasn't that hungry and got a Spicy Tuna roll. While the presentation was beautiful- it came with an interesting soup and a egg thing? The sushi rice wasn't flavored at all and I don't even think the tuna was... 
My other friend got a combo deal of soon du bu and Chilean Seabass for $20- that was ok. I would try one of those deals next time. 
The salad they give in the beginning of the meal was my favorite part. Strange but interesting. 
Overall- I think they're trying too hard for a presentation for what is supposed to be homey comfort food... 
Feeling sick- as soon as I got home I changed into my sweatpants and t-shirt but felt I had to change again to eat suh-lung tang... Who dresses nice to go eat suhl lung tang? Apparently, I do...

"Ordered a $12.95 chirashi and I guess I should know better, but how do you review a place like this? Probably not on taste or preparation, cause you know already what you're in for. I guess... on its health effects?

The ""fish"" was all kinds of fishy, colorfully noxious shades of disgusting. It's funny how a single letter makes all the difference. FISH, not FISHY, please. You can't just hit up ShopRite, pick up some chum, slice it up and call it ""sashimi"". The fish I ate from here had HISTORY. Like, weathered a long journey from the time they met their end, passed along and handled by many a soiled hand, and left on the counter to meditate and reminisce before finally getting served. 

So, how should ratings for terrible sushi restaurants be distributed? Is it necessary to actually be poisoned for a place to deserve the minimum, or it is sufficient to merely FEEL sickened by the taste to earn that mark? 

If i felt a lower rating was appropriate (if that were possible), I'd have to call the police.

"Not sure what all the hype is about. They are in a prime location, they are open super late, food is cheap. great!
But last time I ordered falafel, they were deep frying the falafel and the guy who was trying to wrap some food for someone else dropped the plastic forks (like 4 forks) in the oil. He just kept going while the plastic was melting adding the extra flavor to the falafel. This is ridiculous, someone who eats that falafel with that crazy melting plastic can get really sick.
I pointed it out to the guy and he was like, that's fine. Obviously I didn't buy and left the place amused. 
Food can be delicious, location can be convenient but end of the day no one wants to get sick because of the quality.

"Went with a guy friend to celebrate my promotion. In short, the ambiance and service was great. The food however was disappointing. We opted for the 7 course tasting menu and would not opt to spend that $80 again. I also got sick that night although I can't unequivocally blame the food.

The nondescript door, open kitchen and intimate setting was lovely as was the service. Our waiter suggested a wonderful wine (white I don't recall what from Brooklyn...where brooklyn at!?) and did a wonderful job of explaining the different dishes. 

Nothing stood out. Our tasting menu was just slight variations of the basic menu and the additions were...interesting. I was not too pleased with chicken skin or funion crumbles being presented as fine dinning. I will say that the brussel sprout were delicious and the dessert was excellent. 2/7 isn't good enough to return. My friend also enjoyed his lamb.

"In its heyday, it was a pillar of old-line Chinese - American tiki style dining. Now it just sucks. In fact, my digestive tract is still reeling from dinner there 24 hours ago. The current ""B"" rating by the NY Board of health appears to be well-deserved. 

I had a credible Mai Tai, but the shrimp with lobster sauce main course tasted a bit off, the pork in the sauce being somewhat sour. I should have sent it back, but instead I am streaming it live on the porcelain net...

The egg roll was greasy. The portions small, and grossly overpriced ($13 for a combination plate that goes for $8.50 at any takeout joint, but the take out joint gives better portions and probably won't make you sick because they still have the sales volume). They even skimped on the fried rice.

"My absolute favorite drag queen gay bar. I go once a week with my friends. Always have a fabulous experience  usually walk in before 10, because that's when the first drag show starts. And these are some real drag queens, not the ones you see idolized on tv. Real woMEN with real bodies and real costumes, which is what I love. They're all unique and always put on a great performance. The bartender (pink is our favorite) makes decent drinks. Last time I was there (and reason for 4 stars over 5) is I ordered a pineapple rum, and in return I got literally that. A full glass of pineapple juice and a full glass of rum, separately. I'm sorry, what am I supposed to do with that? My friend then ordered a pineapple and vodka. She got 5 fingers of pineapple jar and ice. So when ordering make sure to be EXTREMELY specific.

"Awful experience.  I went today with my mother and her friend to have lunch at Artisanal.  We happened to be close by and were excited to take advantage of the Restaurant Week menu.  Two of us opted for the menu and chose the skate entree.  I am very familiar with this entree and have eaten it many times at other restaurants. Our mushroom salads to start were very tasty.

When the two orders of skate were served, my friend said it smelled fishy but I proceeded to take a bite and was hit with a powerful taste of ammonia which proceeded to rush up my nose causing a terrible burning sensation up to my sinuses.  It was clear that the fish was spoiled and the new manager (he had just come on a few minutes prior) said he smelled it as well and concurred.  When speaking to this first (new) manager, he apologized and offered a substitute -- I indicated that since the fish I was served was spoiled that at the very least, I should not have to pay for my meal.  He indicated that he didn't have the authority to authorize this and would speak to the other manager, Vincenzo when he was free. 

Vincenzo arrived and I stated my wishes again and indicated that since we were offered a substitute, the restaurant had no obligation to make any sort of accommodation. It was the principal that we were served spoiled food which could have potentially made us sick.  I mentioned I would be potentially writing a review on Yelp and thus am sharing today's experience so that others may be alerted as to how this restaurant handled this delicate situation.

During all of this my nasal passages were still burning.  After this wonderful interchange with Vincenzo, our substitutes arrived -- chicken paillard -- hard and dry as as hockey puck with nondescript slaw on top. 

Suffice it to say, we were made to feel that our upset -- being served spoiled fish was unmerited and by then we had lost our collective appetites leaving the entrees untouched.

Result--We left the restaurant being charged for the two prix meals despite eating only the appetizer.  I must give credit to the kindness of the first manager to which we spoke who did try to advocate for us and our waiter and the hostess who collectively were embarrassed and genuinely struck by Vincenzo's lack of sensitivity and harsh response.  

I guess in the end being served spoiled food at a restaurant doesn't really matter and clearly Artisanal doesn't feel any true regret in doing so.",0.0

"How do people not like Bareburger? It has something for EVERYONE! Farmer's quinoa patty is amazing for the vegetarians in your life! Beef is great! A friend of mine once had some bizarre meat like Ostrich or something and it was GREAT! Once I had a salad - AMAZING! I've been to at least four different Bareburger locations, and they're all stellar, but this is my local Bareburger so I'll review them.

It's an expensive burger. Once you order a burger + fries + tax + tip you're easily looking at $20 a person. But it's sustainably-raised, organic when possible, creative and delicious. So that's okay with me. The salads are fantastic but in my opinion they are overpriced (like $11-15 for an average-sized salad with no protein), so unfortunately I won't be having one anytime soon. When I'm feeling poor but still need my Bareburger fix, I'll buy a kids meal and no one ever looks at my adult self funny. Once I had brunch here and it was crazy good, and totally reasonably priced considering the portion sizes. I've heard the milkshakes are the best, and they sure do look good, but as I don't want my very lactose-intolerant body to implode, I won't be having one anytime soon (vegan milkshakes! vegan milkshakes! subliminal messaging!).  Service can be a bit slow, but it's always friendly and I'm not ever in too big of a hurry. Plus I usually get take-out which is super fast! Delivery is $15 and as a single lady who is budget-conscious I typically only buy a burger which is not $15 and make my own fries at home, so I'm stuck with take-out. It's alright, I literally live two blocks away so I think I can handle it. I would avoid Seamless though. They're very slow with fulfilling Seamless orders for some reason. Just call them or order on their website. So, in conclusion, I love this place. There's a couple of little annoying things (detailed below) but these little nit-picky things won't kill my 5-star rating.

They have a lunch special (eat-in only), which I haven't tried, but seems like a decent deal if you like your burger actually totally bare. Wish it included an upgrade option for a burger that's not totally plain, or let me elect to not have a soda and instead get a modest burger upgrade or was generally more flexible for those of us who don't drink soda and like a couple of toppings on our burgers. I'd probably actually eat there a lot for lunch if this was the case. But that's a tiny thing. But hey managers, fix this and I'll see you at lunch! You can upgrade your lunch special to include a specific beer for like $3 or something, which is pretty neat.

And my only service critique is that sometimes they can be a bit nickel-and-dimey about sauce substitutions. For example my regular burger comes with plain mayo but I like a spicier mayo, so they charge me $.55 to upgrade. I'm alright with that - my choice, I want a fancier mayo. But the kids meal I get comes with ranch, and I'm super lactose intolerant so ranch will actually just make me very sick. And I'm not really crazy about paying extra because I'm intolerant of their only included option. The first couple times they charged me for the upgrade, but once I explained that ranch doesn't work for me because I am extremely lactose intolerant, they stopped charging me the $.55 for the upgrade. I mean, listen, it's $.55 so I'm not gonna throw a fit if they want to charge me. But I just thought it was an amazing example of Bareburger's fantastic customer service that when I explained my sensitivity they gave me the sauce upgrade gratis. Seriously, it's the little things. Thanks Bareburger, keeping my belly pooch real since 2012. See ya this week, I'm sure.",0.0
"The service at Sizzler, in general, has been hit-or-miss throughout the years.  I remember one time at their Rego Park location (Queens Blvd and Junction Blvd, now closed) where I ordered a burger entrée with salad bar and the [censored] server didn't bring the salad plates until the entrée was ready!  The whole point is to be able to enjoy the salad bar BEFORE eating the entrée, and on this occasion if I did that the burger would have gotten cold.  I wish I had called the manager and read him the riot act.

But that was a different location, now closed.

Back when they had numerous locations in the NY area, different stores had their own policies and practices.  At some locations, the salad plates were at the salad bar and you help yourself.  At others, the server brings you plates.  I remember one time at Metropolitan Avenue (this location) where we had to wait a long time for our plates.  The sign above the salad bar taunted us: ""Nobody salads like Sizzler!""  My inner Sam Kinison wanted to shout, ""I'd like to find out for myself, if only you'd bring me some [censored] PLATES!!!!!""

As far as the food...

I generally order the Malibu Chicken entrée.  Malibu Chicken is a breaded piece of chicken with a piece of ham and cheese melted on top of it.  It's pretty good.  It comes with your choice of potato (fries, baked) and a large piece of ""Sizzler Toast.""  Once in a blue moon I've gotten the burger but it wasn't that great.

When it comes to the salad bar, I only like a few things.  On the hot salad bar, I like the mac and cheese and the corn fritters/puffs/(whatever they're called).  I take a couple of onion rings, and sometimes I take a couple of pieces of sausage from the sausage-with-peppers tray.  On the cold salad bar, I just LOVE the tuna pasta salad - I could probably just order the salad bar by itself and fill up with this!  The only thing I don't like about it is the red things, which I presume are tomatoes.  When I fill my plate I make sure not to take any of the red things.  (I just don't like them, I'm not saying they're 'bad' in the sense that if you eat them you'll get sick.  You won't.)  The tuna pasta salad would be a perfect dish if they didn't have those red things in them, so I don't have to deal with fishing them out.

They offer free refills on sodas, which is a definite plus in my book - but depending on the server, it can be tough to get their attention and even after you ask for the refill you might have to wait a few minutes before they bring it out.

Desserts: the ""ice cream"" is more like ice milk.  It's very thin.  I prefer the chocolate pudding, which is available in the salad bar.  Sometimes I take one of the ice cream cones and put some pudding in it.

Final thought: I was surprised to learn that this was the only location in the Northeast United States, because there used to be many more in NYC and the metropolitan area - Rego Park, Bayside, Massapequa Park, Elmont (just to name four), and we used to go to those locations all the time.  The food is okay, and I'd go back. If you're visiting NYC from one of the areas where Sizzler is common, you might want to check it out to see how this one compares to the ones back home.",0.0
"I came down with a really horrible stomach flu last night and have been completely bedridden with alternating fever/chills. Really awesome stuff. At about hour 24 of feeling absolutely terrible, I realized I needed to get some hydration but water wasn't doing it, so I decided to see if I could get some gatorade from somewhere. Now, if I was feeling capable of leaving my apartment without fear of losing control of my faculties, I would have just gone out and gotten some, problem solved. However, as that wasn't the case, I decided to call around to see if anyone was able to deliver.

The man I talked to on the phone at Associated was very nice, and took my order. I ended up ordering more than I wanted to be sure I met their minimum, which was a very kind $10. I was planning on tipping more than I normally would for the silliness of what I ordered, 2 big gatorades and 2 big gingerales. I was told that was enough for delivery, so I gave them my address (about 3 blocks away) and phone number and was told that it would be there in about 10 minutes. 

10 minutes comes and goes, then 20, then 30. I call back at about 40 minutes and ask, as kindly as possible, if I may have missed the delivery person somehow (though I don't know how as I hadn't moved since I'd called). The man said that the delivery person had left about 10 minutes ago, and that he would call him to check on where he was. I never received a call back.

An hour and 10 minutes after my original call, and still nothing. I called back and a woman picked up and I told her about the issue. She told me that the delivery person had gone out, COULDN'T FIND MY ADDRESS, and had come back. And since there was only her, the manager and the delivery person at the store, he wouldn't be going out again. As I continued to feel my stomach turn, now from a combination of being sick and lack of anything in it, I informed her that that was impossible since the building was only 3 blocks away, extremely clearly marked (it's kind of notable building in the area) and literally the only building on that stretch of my street between the two cross streets I'd given. She said she knew, but that he couldn't go out again. I clarified that he in fact did go out and came back because he claimed he couldn't find the address, she said yes, so I asked her why he hadn't called since he had my phone number. She said she would go check, and that was when I was hung up on.

I would have loved to air these grievances over the phone with the manager because I'm not usually a fan or negative reviews based on one experience, but I wasn't left with much of a choice since it became abundantly clear that they didn't want to speak with me over the phone.

I'm fully aware that I do not live far from this grocery store, and that in a normal situation, I could have just gone out myself. But anyone that has had the stomach flu knows that you really don't want to be out anywhere when in the throws of it, and sometimes the only thing that helps is a little bit of gatorade and gingerale and kindness. I'm so fuming mad that I was given the run around on this simply because I really needed the stuff, and if they had just told me that the order was too small to deliver or they didn't have enough people, I would have understood and moved on to my next option then instead of an hour and a half of grossness later. I can't believe that they consider it good business to not only not deliver on a promise that is actually very simple to fulfill, but then not even apologize or acknowledge that they did something wrong, but instead end the interaction by hanging up on me. I used to shop here occasionally, but I never will again, simply because I don't want to support a place that is dishonest. It's literally called a convenience store. Be convenient and if you can't, at least be honest.

I gave it two stars because it's a decent grocery store when you go in person, aside from the fact that the customer service in person is usually pretty slow as well.",0.0
"I'm very picky with hookah lounges and this review is based on me going to X-hale about a dozen times. Good amount of my friends do their birthdays and anniversaries here, so I cannot really say I chose to come here but more like ""forced"". X-Hale has a decent variety of hookahs but they are expensive for no reason. It's about 4$ more than most lounges around the area. 

Another huge CON is their customer service, it is disgusting. The workers are just plain rude. On several occasions they would not listen to you when you ask for something as simple as a bottle of water. Another bad  occurrence was when I came in on a cold January night, I came in to wish my friend a happy birthday. Not only did the security give me a hard time because I left my ID in the car and made me walk back to get it, even though I said I will be in and out. Once I came in with my ID I come in to say hello the waiter tells me to leave. His reason was that I had a cup of tea and they do not allow outside drinks. I was sick and drinking TheraFlu with Vitamin C. I explained to him that I'm just coming in to say hello. His words were and I quote ""get the f*ck out of here"". Who in their right mind would treat a customer like that? Will not be coming back here intentionally.

"Came to have breakfast and the food is super cheap for the area.

I ordered an ice coffee with a breakfast platter. For $4 I received a sausage patty, home fries, 2 eggs, and 2 slices of toast. The coffee was $3. Totally a great deal for this area. They also have additional seating upstairs. 

My qualm about this place is how frugal they were when I asked for a cup of water. I was told that I needed to purchase a bottle instead. I understand that this is midtown, but I am already purchasing other things from your store. Business tactics like this sicken me.

Other than that the food is a great bang for your buck. Don't expect much service, though. Basically a typical grocery storevwith seating.",0.0

"Review for the cream puff only.  From the look and sound of it on here, I could not wait to get a  matcha cream puff.  Waited an hour for them to come fresh out of the oven at 11:00am.   In reality the puff was tasteless - both the shell and the 'matcha' filling.  If you're going to call something matcha, then please have some real matcha or at least green tea flavor. No-taste too-crunchy crunches on top made it even worse.  Also got the dark chocolate one -- no better but this one did have flavor-- an over powering much too powerful chocolate.  Sickening.

Wings were great. Came out hot, cooked perfect (well done, but not burnt). We wanted the shots in a glass with ice and Eddie did it no problem. When we ordered the 3rd round, he made specialty shots on the house for us.

Please don't put those benches and chairs in the middle of the street. Please don't mingle in the middle of the street. Please don't trash the street with cigarette buds.

"Maybe this place just doesn't have a vibe that vibes with me, but I cannot describe how utterly disappointed I was with my experience here. My food was less than memorable, and the service, albeit friendly, was atrocious. Of course we all want friendly and polite staff, however, I don't want them to be SO laid back and SO ""chill,"" that they forget they are doing a job. When my server messed up our order, he seemed so nonchalant about it, as if the establishment was forgiving ME for complaining.... 

Moreover, i ordered a Kettle Extra Dirty on the rocks, but they didn't have Kettle -- understandable, i guess. However, when I received my drink, I thought I was going to suffer from alcohol poisoning after the first sip. Now, I know some people complain about drinks not being ""stiff"" enough, but I am not one of those people. Bartenders are taught to count their pours (or eye-level them, whatever) for a reason. And these counts are to set up a proportion to make the drink taste less like I'm dying to get intoxicated, and more like I am trying to enjoy an alcoholic beverage -- make sense? I get that they are probably just used to the crowd requesting a heavy pour, however, that is not the right way to do things. And a heavy pour should only be used at the request of a customer who WANTS a stronger drink. A martini is a strong drink in and of itself, which i understand. But that is also why I ordered the drink to be extra dirty. It was all alcohol and no olive juice. 

Maybe I don't remember my meal bc it was just ok; maybe I don't remember it because I was too busy wondering where my waiter was half the time. Or maybe I don't remember it bc the smell of my martini (which I couldn't even finish) erased all of my memory from that evening. 

The other customers, however, did seem to be having a good time. But do not go here if you are a stickler for objectively great service and objectively well-made drinks.",0.0

"My friend begged me to not write this review because she loves this place, so perhaps they were having an off night, nonetheless I'm going to state right now that I will give this place another shot. We went here on Friday night to chill out with the ladies and enjoy a few drinks. It was empty in there. We might've been the only group. It's kind a small place, the lighting is dim and intimate just how I like it. The waiter approached us, basically coughing and barely able to speak, he seemed really sick and I was automatically turned off. Don't come to work if you're sick and work in the service bizz that's just not right! We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, and one of the girls ordered a mojito. Oh and my friend ordered the cheese plate. He came back quickly with the most bitter sangria I've ever had in my life. Literally tasted like wine on ice. No fruits. No nothing. It was really not enjoyable. My friend that ordered the mojito agreed how bitter her drink was. We flagged down the contagious waiter and told him that the sangria was not to our liking and that we did not want it. He took it back free of charge (as he should've I took two sips). Wasn't rude about it but wasn't really nice about it either. He didn't even try to offer us anything else. But whatever. My friend said the cheese and bread was good so one star for the store bought cheese and bread (don't mean to sound rude but c'mon).

"The look of the store is great, they candy looks great, they have funny chocolate bars like the boyfriend bar, the where's Waldo bar, the bacon bar, the I love you bar. They have super Sized candies. all the candy nice and well presented, but it is pretty over-priced.
        That wasn't the real problem i had with the store. My friend and I entered the store around 1:30 in the afternoon on a friday, we didn't have school. We are both in our early teens, tho i am pretty tall for my age (5,7) and she is 5,5. We are both of mixed race and have a darker pigment.
      I was looking for presents for some of my friends as well as the secret santa gift exchange we were doing at school. My friend and i were chatting about the different kinds of bars and what to get for whom and so on. I do not think we were being overly loud or obnoxious.
     at one point i picked up a candy bar (the bacon chocolate) and mentioned i would probably just get this for my friend.  This whole time the one lady at the desk (an older white woman)   had been staring us down and glaring at us, while repeatedly asking if we needed any help. I had responded to each inquiry with ""no thanks, we are good"" and yet she kept asking. Eventually when my friend had bagged all the candy she wanted, she went up to the cashier to pay and i put the chocolate bar telling her (my friend) that i would come back to buy it on tuesday because we were not doing our exchange until wednesday. I met up with her at the cashier, after putting the bar down, and the woman asked ""where is that candy bar?"" and i responded with ""i put it back"". She then glared at my hands in my pockets and my purse. I promptly took my hands out of my pockets. and returned her glares with handing my friend, my debit card from my purse and paying for her candy. 
      As we left, the lady STILL continued to stare at us angrily and then walked up from behind the desk to check and see if the bar was where i had put it. 

TO SAY THE LEAST: i felt incredibly uncomfortable and wrongly accused of something i didn't do.  I WON'T be going back to buy that over priced chocolate bar on tuesday. i'm SICK of the racism in some places.

"One of my favorite places in the West Village, so glad they opened up a second location. I went in for my first visit and was impressed with the beautiful new space with (yay!) outdoor seating.  I brought a friend who is dairy-free and was impressed at the detail that the staff takes to handling dietary restrictions. From the detailed menu to the knowledgeable staff, you never feel like you're crazy for asking for exactly what you need.

Additionally, the food is just GOOD. I'm addicted to the breadsticks and we enjoyed a really fresh salad to start. Following, we both had risottos. I had the porobello, mozzarella and truffle oil, which is an old favorite from the old location that didn't let me down. 

You can't go wrong with most of these, although this one is the perfect comfort food and they're very generous with the truffle oil (definitely sick of other places calling something 'truffle' when they just sprinkle a little cheap truffle salt on it).

Finally, the wine list is SOLID. You can't go wrong with any of these picks, and they're always reasonable and constantly changing. Great girl's night, and not too expensive either.",0.0

"I went here on Saturday night with three others before venturing to see the tree. My boyfriend and I arrived a bit late due to traffic and I'm always happy when a restaurant will seat the party even before everyone is there. My friend ordered a salumeria platter which was quite delicious. It was a nice selections of meats accompanied by cheese, olives, and a grilled polenta cake. 

The main courses were veal piccata, fettuccine ai funghi, a pasta dish with a red tomato and eggplant sauce and a shrimp dish. Everyone said their food was wonderful but I sadly didn't feel the same way. My pasta was extremely oily to the point that I had to stop eating because it was making me feel sick. The truffle and garlic flavors were trying to overpower each other so much that it ended up making the dish fairly unappetizing. 

I would definitely go back as I think I just picked the wrong dish/the chef had an off night with that entree. I still do recommend Maria Pia for the location, atmosphere, menu, and courteous staff.",0.0
"We dined here during peak hours and although it was quite busy the service was still great. Our waitress were very nice and accomodating. Trying to get around in the restaurant with it being that crammed was not very easy though.

The drinks were strong, not watered down in the least. The food was also fantastic. I ordered the The Jdob Lobster Roll with Waffle Chips and it was quite delicious. The fries were yum and crispy. My friend is a huge fan of their kedgeree. I tried it as well and it was pretty good but the portion size for the price just doesn't add up. 

The bathrooms are super clean. It was a little loud so I would not recommend bringing a date here but it's perfectly good for a friendly hang out session or a late night. 

I returned again and tried to do a takeout order. They told me they don't do takeout and the chef was pretty stern about his response. I mentioned that I had a friend (the same one who I'd dined with prior) who was home and was very sick (true story) and she loves their kedgeree and that I wanted to do something nice to surprise her and cheer her up. The waitress thought it was a very nice gesture and told me she would do what she could for me just this once. She told me to ask for her by name upon arrival. Clearly I won't post her name here because I don't want to get her in trouble.

That was so nice of her! She really didn't have to do that for me. My friend was really happy too and was shocked that I made it happen because she knew they didn't do takeout. Nothing was going to stop me though. I would have gladly sat down and pretended to eat and then asked them to wrap it up to go haha

He asked me what party I was with and I didn't know I needed to be with a party to get in so he told me to have one of my friends come outside so he could confirm I was there to meet people for reasons I don't really understand. When my friend came out he proceeded to explain to her that he wouldn't let me in unless we got a table which would cost about $500 for four people, 3 of whom were already inside giving this ridiculous establishment their business for hours! To say the host was rude is an understatement. He honestly made me sick but his orgasmic power trip was quite entertaining.

To all the black customers, he told them they needed to buy bottles, and would let them know how many they were required to purchase based on the number of people in their party. The white ones were told absolutely nothing and to enjoy their evenings as they were let right in.

"I gave 4 for my first eat-in experience but I could skip Shokudou lunch set (see photo)

- Shokudou set -
The homemade Yuzu dressing on the salad was refreshing, crispy and tasty. Miso soup was packed with tofu cubes but the deconstructed Sukiyaki, main dish, didn't wow me. It didn't make to come back for more like other dishes, Katsu-sando and Eggu-sando. If I want sets (Teishoku), I rather go to Ippudo.

-Other items I want to try -
There were other nostalgic items like Omurice and Kissaten-style pasta with a ketchupy tomato sauce.

- Must dish -
We were both absolutely blown away by their pancake, outer texture of the cake is nutty-crunchy-sweet and fluffy soft and all combination was sick! It wasn't rich as Castella, a Japanese egg cake introduced by Portuguese in 16th Century. Excellent choice for sweet breakfast. Think of it, Castella could be a good choice as a pancake if toasted and give a crunchy outer skin.

- East meets West -
HC dishes are Japanese version of HK Cantonese style dishes or vise versa. HK style restaurants in C-town are Cha Chan Tang and, recently introduced by Michael L., Cafe Hong Kong. I found their dishes are ""East meets West"" like Hi-Collar.

- Sweets -
Another items that I want to try is their milkshake with cream(?).  Two big guys in a restaurant business-types were really enjoying it. I understood why those big boys were sharing only one, it was packed and high but I think it's a manageable portion for sweet lovers. Next item, they were having was the pancake.

- Entertainment -
Chatty and charming Yuko(?) talked fast, like mostly people from Osaka, with her uniquely Osaka dialect, Kansai-ben. She was comically very entertaining. Most famous comedians are from Osaka. It is worth coming by and see her show. She is the one closer to the entrance, and Chika is the one mostly in the kitchen, 

- Dream -
If I live near HC, this will be my go-to place as a neighborhood cafe, no sitting outside and watching people but feeling fresh in a clean and calm Japanesey space and listing to a ""swing"" feel Jazz and spend relaxing time for some minutes in the morning before going off to reality.

"I have lived in this neighborhood a long time and shopped a lot at Frank's Market, mostly because of the lack of choice up here.  I am fed up with the bad customer service.  Many of the checkout personnel have no concept of customer service.  They seem unhappy for whatever reason.  They are careless.  Don't apologize if they make a mistake.  Act like you are inconveniencing them if you have to come back because they charged you wrong.  Give you attitude.  Make excuses instead of just saying sorry.  The checkout setup is very cramped.  Customers are too close together.  Often someone is blocking you from being able to place your purchase on the counter.  The staff never help with this and ask the other customer to move over.  Once a checkout girl completely blocked me as I was making a purchase and I wanted to pick up my own bags to leave.  She got mad that I asked her to move.  She could have waited until I had finished to shove in front of me.  She yelled at me.  Nice customer service.  They act like they have a chip on their shoulders.  Customer Service.  It's very important.  Get someone to train your staff.  They don't say hello or thank you.  I have to say that.  No smile, no thank you.  You have to draw it out of them.  We customers have to be the friendly one.

Also, I have low confidence in the freshness of anything in the store.  A lot of the produce often has a wilted quality.  Once I bought Haagen Dazs ice cream and it had freezer burn and was icy instead of creamy.  I've never bought any there again. Other things I've bought were bad or past expiration.  Packaged salads seem to have post-dated expirations as they are already wilted. It turns you off and you lose confidence.  Inconsistent stocking.  They rearrange the store constantly so you have to work to find things.  A regular cup of coffee had a hazelnut flavor and they insisted they kept it separate in coffee pots then I realized they probably ground the beans in the same grinder.  It had to get the flavor somehow, I tasted it.  They told me I was wrong.  Prices always seem high, especially for this neighborhood or any neighborhood.

Mostly I am sick of the bad attitudes of the staff.  I often have spent a lot of money there for convenience.  I'm really going to try not to go there anymore.  I can get some stuff at the Associated Market nearby (their produce is even worse).  And I'll try to shop downtown at better markets.  Fairway or Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or LifeThyme Market or Union Sq. Greenmarket.  Have to plan a trip but I won't resent shopping there.  The produce down at the Korean Market at 181 St. is always fresh.  At Associated at least the checkout girls are friendly and professional and rarely make mistakes.

I'm sick of being treated like an annoyance instead of a good customer.  It's been like this for years.  Obviously they don't care.  I've been up here 17 years.  Before their transformation from a smaller old-fashioned market.  They seem to never have learned how to operate a market on a professional level.  They don't know what they are doing and don't care as long as they are making money.  If they had competition they would close for sure.  I hope a Trader Joe's or something similar opens up here.

But it's really all about the food.  I came for the bone marrow tacos (because duh), but that octopus was the best I've ever had.  And the sauce that comes with it, I think it was cilantro-jalapeno-lime, was the sort of thing top chef judges lose their minds over.
I wish I lived closer, or that it was open for lunch, but it's worth planning part of my Clinton Hill / Fort Greene outings to include stopping in here.",0.0
"The restaurant is located right near a beautiful garden shop in lower Manhattan surrounded by historic buildings, so it has a pleasant feel to it. Inside, the spare clean lines of the dining room were restful. 

The lunch specials looked price-worthy, but I declined because I was specifically after one thing.  After all the street cart papaya salads I had grazed on throughout my recent visit to Thailand (without once falling sick thanks to the smacking hot chillis), I was hankering for a ""Som Tam"".  In fact even as I write, the mouth juices start flowing; the sour/sweet/hot taste conjured up by the very mention of papaya salad  is so compelling.

Their papaya salad is a great size, and you can ask for additional spice.  I relished it, it was crunchy, nicely presented, and hit the spot. My hankering was nicely satiated.

Gratis addition: A nice New York City touch as the table rumbles when the Subway runs underneath.",0.0
"One of my go-to Indian spots in the neighborhood (the other one being Papadam). 



The lunch buffet is a great deal and most importantly, has never gotten me sick thus far. The notable entrees here are the fish curry (when they have it), lamb curry, and saag paneer. The chicken tikka is not bad but could be spicier. The tandoori chicken also could be better if other chicken parts were used besides drum sticks.



I don't come here that often... Maybe once a month. But it is worth noting that the wait staff are always friendly and helpful, willing to talk about what food they are serving and ingredients. Always a pleasant experience here, thanks!",0.0
"I had lunch takeout and they offer a 10% discount Mon-Fri before 5pm. I had pho with beef brisket, tripe and tendons, and the veggie spring roll (2pcs). The pho was a very comforting and simple bowl of noodle soup, not a ton of depth in flavor, and I don't even know if it was authentic, but I was feeling sick and looking for a warm bowl of comfort food and the pho definitely did the trick. What made the pho particularly good were the tendons - so chewy and soft. Wish there were more! They actually mistakenly gave me shrimp spring roll instead of veggie. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and I thought the peanut chunks in the dipping sauce were a nice touch. $10 credit card minimum. The restaurant has really limited seating and I don't even know if there is a bathroom, but central park and morningside park are both nearby and I definitely recommend getting takeout for a picnic.",0.0
"The good:
Glasses were clean.  I did not get sick from the food.

The bad:
The service, the food, the experience.

Not sure what was going on here when i came last week, but i wish I went to subway instead.  After waiting for an eternity for my water and my food, it came out and honestly was terrible.  The broth was cold, the rice cakes tasted like they were microwaved.

"I never leave reviews but this place was just  plain awful. Easily the worst dining experience in years. Empty on Friday night at 10:30. Margaritas were ALL sugar and too sweet to drink.

"Our yesterday's visits here (5/14/2015, 2:45pm)  was one of my worst experiences. First of all one of their employees had a horrendous sneezing fits, he had nothing to cover up his face and so he was sneezing happily around the bakery. I wanted to leave, as it was disgusting, but my friend likes the coffee there, so we stayed. Later I tried to find out the name of the sneezing guy, but David, who was the ""in charge"" refused to give me his name. I guess David was ""in charge"" as the rest of the employees did not speak English - and I do not speak Korean. The pastry we chose (we liked it before) was so soaked in oil this time, that it made me sick. Obviously, the cook, Youn Hwa,  did not fry it in hot enough oil. When I wanted to talk to her, she also did not speak English. She talked for a long time to David, and David's  only translation was ""she is sorry."" I did ask for the name and phone number of the manager, Taylor Young, presumably also Korean, but he did not pick up his phone and his answering box was full .... I have no idea why this place is called Paris Baguette, when it is such a Korean ethnic outfit, perfectly unfriendly to American visitors - or is that the French touch ?",0.0

One guy wanted the snow crab since he's been sick of all the king crab.  

My friend and I got the king crab.  I ended up getting cajun spice with my king crab and shrimp.  They got Garlic butter which was also good.  

We got the catfish and fries which was really good on seasoning and breading.  I think next time were going try the raw options as well.",0.0
"When my friend suggested this place and said ""shaved ice"" I was a bit hesitant. All I gotta say is that this is not your normal shaved ice. I've never had anything like this, and it's pretty amazing. It's kind of like a light fluffier ice cream. They have only a few flavors but they're all pretty good. I wish they had more fruity flavors though. Green tea is my favorite. They also have a lot of great toppings.

If you're sick of ice cream or frozen yogurt, this is the place to go. You won't regret it.",0.0
"Since I work in the Lipstick Building, I am really familiar with Crimson & Rye and their food. We have ordered catering from them a bunch of times and the food is always really good! So when someone suggested stopping by there for food and drinks as a celebration, I was really excited. 

We originally thought we wouldn't be able to get a seat since they were hosting a private event but we got in and got seated at a booth. They were really busy which I suppose is why the service took a LONG time to come greet us. As always, the menu for drinks is really expansive and their specialty drinks are delicious even if you're paying $13-16 for them. We got there around 5:00PM so I was a little disappointed in their food options, light apps mostly but we ended up ordering both kinds of popcorn, beef sliders and the kettle chips. The kettle chips were definitely my favorite but the table was pretty pleased with our food and drinks all around. 

My one friend was sick and asked for tea and they brought her a kettle full of tea and even some honey which was really sweet. Unfortunately, the kettle had a leak in it. It wouldn't have been too big of a problem except that since it took our server about 15 minutes to check on us after dropping it off, it made quite the mess. 

As our meal was reaching the end, more people began to stream in which wouldn't be a problem except they couldn't all fit around the bar and some people wanted to sit so they stood next to our table. I was curious if someone would ask them to move away from the seating area since we were trying to eat and drink and being stared at by a group of strangers who are intent on getting your table is extremely uncomfortable, to say the least! However, a server actually gave them drinks as they stood there commenting loudly about how they want to sit down. We were not dragging our feet but rather waiting for our server to return to get the check but the discomfort that the entire table felt made half of us WANT to drag our feet and the other half just want to leave. It was an uncomfortable way to end a so-so trip.  

Overall, the drinks are exceptional and varied and the fare is light but delicious. When they are busy, expect to wait for both seating and service. I wish they would designate a waiting area rather than allowing people to crowd around the booths but otherwise an alright experience.",0.0
"I have been going to Friend's Tavern for years. Our community usually involves people that are understanding and compassionate but last night was one of the worst night club experiences I have ever had. To celebrate a friend's birthday we decided to head to Friend's Tavern only to be turned away while the bouncer pointed at one of our friends and said she was drunk. We told him she was sick with brain cancer and she was not drunk but he only called us liars and told us to go away. I managed to get inside to get the manager feeling that he would remedy the situation. Instead, the manager who refused to give us his name said if indeed she was sick she shouldn't be out in a bar anyway. Obviously we were very insulted and most of all felt the pain and humiliation our sick friend who was being called a drunk to her face must of felt. The manager continued to say that he had to back up his staff and that we would not get in. I will never step foot in this place again. The compassion, friendly atmosphere and care we usually find in our community is no where to be found in this place. DISRESPECTFUL and DISCRIMINATORY place.",0.0
"I made my final shopping trip to Fairway tonight, where I learned exactly how they keep prices down and do well enough to open more stores and (rumor has it) IPO. They make the cashiers, and all people who work there and touch your food, come to work sick. My cashier was coughing into her shirt and looked terrible. Overhearing her conversation with another employee (while she touched every item of my  purchase) I learned that she had 102 degree temp this morning and 107 last night, but Fairway does not accommodate sick days or even calling in sick.

"When I turned quarter of a century, I decided to ring in my birthday at the elegant and very composed Kumo Sushi. 

Let's be real, I love this place for what it is, an absolute mess. The sushi is okay, don't come here expecting high quality sushi, Japanese food, or great sake for that matter. Sushi comes out by the plateful, sake and beer in pitchers. What I find especially admirable is their ability to control the chaos that ensues from the all you can eat and drink 2 hour show. I had a group of about 25 with me and I can very confidently say that college did not prepare us for what we encountered. We were messy, loud, and some people in my party got sick. Somehow, the servers navigated through the throngs of drunk people to continuously and promptly bring us our food, refill our pitchers, and collect our bill. One disgraceful member of my party got sick right outside of the restaurant, a server promptly brought over a bucket of water, washed the sick into the street, all evidence gone. 

This place deserves 10 stars for tolerating raucous and ""unable to cope with turning 25"" customers. Kumo, you will always have a special place in my heart. I love you for your infinite patience and grit.",0.0
"My girlfriend got sushi here for lunch, and got sick from it. After getting back on her feet she came back to let them know about it, only to be harassed by the sushi ""chef"". This person was far more concerned with other people overhearing that the sushi was bad than with the fact that it was bad.

This is no way to treat anybody, much less someone you've caused to be physically sick.

I'm assigning 2 stars instead of one because I've picked up lunch and groceries before and it's an average, if overpriced, experience most of the time. Obviously the sushi isn't bad 100% of the time, but I would strongly advise to steer clear of this location. Go to LZ Sushi, or Monster Sushi nearby for quick sushi...anywhere else but here.",0.0
"I've always had a love-hate relationship for egg tarts...probably because I munched on them every chance I got at dim sum as a kid, and got sick of them eventually. 

I recently went on an egg tart ""craze"" and started going to Flushing a lot more than usual--just to get my egg tart fix. I love their ""buy 3, get 1 free"" promotion, but the egg tarts themselves are still a little more expensive than normal--at $1.50 each.

This outpost is particularly pushed all the way to the back to J-Mart, where the fruit section is, so it can be easy to miss this and see this as another unestablished bakery. This place is always fully-stocked with egg tarts and has more variety than its main location--probably because it has an emphasis on its egg tarts. Their Egg Custard tart, is by far, their best egg tart. It doesn't have an overwhelming sweetness to it and it does taste like it was made with fresh eggs. The Portuguese Tart is also really good, and a lighter version of the Egg Custard. The Sesame Tart isn't that great...it lacks flavor in the custard itself and in the sesame paste they use, which is usually all grounded in the bottom. It's almost as if it's flavorless. I got the Papaya and Milk Custard for my mother, both which she said were good, so the Milk Custard is on my bucket list the next time I go. Their buttery, flaky crust is absolutely delicious. Try to get these when they are hot and fresh out of the oven!",0.0
I loved this place! I work right around the corner and got sick of the same ol same so I ordered through Seamless as a pick up order.

"Well to start off I loved Sushi Samba,my wife and I went there a number of times before it closed. Since we live in the area and were delighted to see that space transform overnight into a restaurant again. We made a web reservation in which seemed sort of hard to get even though it is their first week. We came in and promptly shown to our table. We were approached by our very ""enthusiastic"" server. He smiled a hell of a lot. Every time he came to the table his attitude was so positive it could make you sick.
There was a small snag, we ordered dumplings, they took longer than expected, the server took care of it spoke to a manager, and were made up with the next round of wine on them! We didn't mind, but they were so insistent.
We had questions about the menu, and were pleasantly surprised that in the first week the server knew about the food to a T. He offered some things, but we decided on others. Still the food was tasty the drinks were nice, the ambiance was exciting, everything came out a little quicker than we had wished, but that was ok, we were going to see a movie anyways.
At the end we asked the server for his name, he hesitated then smiled and told us. Which added to his goofy persona. Well in the end the food was good, the atmosphere fun, and the service great!",0.0
"We went last week and each got the $99 prix fixe:

**Appetizer: I was expecting to prefer the lobster, but the octopus was definitely the winner. Would order again! I usually love lobster, but this one didn't have any flavor. I recommend skipping, especially since it's an extra charge with the prix fixe.
**Pasta: I got the famous fusilli without the bone marrow, as it's veal and my bf doesn't eat beef. I can tell you it's still delicious! However, after having the octopus app, the octopus in this dish isn't quite as good. Would order again, none-the-less. My bf got the gnocchi with ruby red shrimp and chilies. The waiter automatically assured us that it wouldn't be spicy, as if this were a common concern. However, we asked them to please make it spicy. Marea chefs don't mess around!! It was SUPER-spiced, good flavor, but this pasta was definitely skimpier on the meat, and I wasn't a huge fan of the gnocchi itself. Unsure if I would get this again.
**Detour to the bread basket: There were 4 kinds. The black pepper focaccia  was my favorite (omg), closely followed by the olive focaccia....the other 2 were very plain, which might be good if you want to sop up some extra pasta sauce without other flavors interfering.
**Mains: I got the scallops and they were amazing - big and juicy. I was scraping my plate, and would definitely order again. If you're an idiot like me, the lamb's quarters in the description are a green...not actual lamb. My bf got the branzino - i have NO idea what people are talking about when they said this was too dry. Maybe they ordered the whole fish, which is prepped differently? Ours was flavorful and moist, and we loved it. It also came over corn, among other things - i usually don't like corn that much, but this was good. Success.
**Dessert: He got the semifreddo which I would recommend. However, I don't think I would get the bomboloni again. I'm not a fan of donuts so i dont really know why i ordered it. However, if you do like donuts, these are probably the best i've had.
**General note: With the tiny portions, we were worried about being full. However, neither of us could finish our desserts. We were thoroughly stuffed! If I did this again, I would recommend eating less bread....im not even going to admit how many pieces i ate:)

**Drinks: I started with the poire royale with vodka and pear - somehow the pear translated to a weird banana-like flavor. Neither of us liked, but still finished it. Then we asked for their other vodka cocktail (nuvoloso) - the waiter immediately said he wouldn't recommend it - not a good sign. We instead went with the melone d'estate (gin), which was much, much better, but still not amazing. For $17 cocktails i think they have room to improve!
**Ambiance: We were seated right above an air conditioning vent - i put my jacket on (in july!) and was still freezing. The wait staff were aware of the problem without us even complaining, as they  were trying to place our candle away from the stream of the vent so it wouldn't blow out...i don't understand why you would seat people there!
Additionally, there was a woman next to us who brought her tween-aged daughter along....which would have been zero problem if it wasn't for her deep/hacking cough throughout our dinner, which she partly covered. She also played a music video on her phone (with volume) and at another point just started singing loudly. Please please please, when you're not at a family-style restaurant, do not take your kids along if they are not going to behave - or at least say something when they are being rude? Also if you have a really bad cough...i'm sorry you're sick...but maybe hold off the fine dining until next week? Would be much appreciated. If you get a better seat than we did, I think Marea has the potential to have a wonderful, romantic atmosphere.",0.0
"One word - RUDE RUDE RUDE. The front desk is INCREDIBLY RUDE. I am sick of dealing with rude people at restaurants, we are the paying customers and you are charging a premium, at least make an effort to be nice or even professional, do your job. No wonder people don't like to tip anymore. When you reserve online, you NEVER find seats for more than 2 people unless you book at least 2-3 weeks in advance for weekends. Even though they have seating the online system only books round tables for more than 2. I always have to call to make change because they can accommodate you, they just don't want to. I have gone there for years and sent many people, but things have gotten progressively worse. The front desk treats you like crap, Cleo is the woman's name. She doesn't care whether you are a new or regular customer, she will bite your head off and won't even listen. And their food takes at least ONE HOUR to arrive. Why is there always a wait here and they are packed? Because you have to wait forever for the food. Their menu has also changed and is just not the same anymore. Nobody there seems happy with their jobs. I will NEVER go there, thanks to Cleo's rudeness. I suggest going here if you like being treated poorly. It is just not worth it. Walk a few blocks to Rosa Mexicano and get treated better, their margaritas are good too. For a low-key breakfast, walk to 59th St and 5th Ave to the Wafels and Dinges mini-truck for their awesome waffles. Or go to The Plaza underground on 5th Ave, they have good restaurants and a wide selection. There are so many good places in the area that the poor treatment, premium prices, and long wait at Norma's is just not worth it.

"Well PK, if you wanted me to stop coming here at all to eat, with my last visit you may have succeeded. 
Came here for brunch at the recommendation of a friend when we had plans to go elsewhere. There was no paper brunch menu apparently-the waitress didn't know what was going on-I just said I would like scrambled eggs. She didn't tell me the brunch plate came filled with meats, nor did she seem to know anything about the brunch menu at all. As I usually get burgers here, I should have stuck with a burger. The eggs/sausage/ham/bacon beef platter was uber greasy and made me almost sick to my stomach. I ate just the eggs and picked some at the bacon. I ordered this with a bloody mary-which I never received and had to request from the bartender by walking up myself. Something was wrong with it-it had an irregular smoky taste to it which tasted different than the bloody mary my friend had ordered earlier. Bad mix? Unmixed mix? I didn't think it was a house mix but I sent it back and switched to beer. Ah. Cold bottled goodness. 
The waitstaff disappeared throughout our stay-things like forks and drinks went missing. We would order drinks from one of the several wait staff that was floating randomly around and then they just didn't appear. We had to get them ourselves from the bartender. Then, now over a half hour since the initial drink order, the waiter told us our beers would be right there. Um-ok. The bartender had no issue in the 30 seconds it took him to open the friggen bottles. 
Oh-taps were inoperational for the beginning of our stay. Nearing the end, I suppose they got them working again-gave us warm, flat beer in warm glasses that tasted like soap. Or something weird and not right. Apparently this place does not believe in ""cold frosty mugs from the freezer"" to serve beer in. You do burgers and beer and don't have cold glasses? Hmmmm. 
Ah yes-and they revealed at the last second that the credit card machine was not working. More evidence that this place is an absolute mess. And the ATM in house was broken. 
Sigh. I really, really wanted to like this place. It has actually gotten worse over time. The service and food here were awful. If I ever go back again, I would love to update this review to a more positive one. Previous visits were a dingy environment made up for by good burgers and beers and a wait staff that seemed to know what they were doing. This time, I left here very sad.

The atmosphere is very clean, modern and great for getting lunch with friends or catching up on work. The seating is very spacious and the people who work here are very friendly. Bonus is that there is an ATM inside.

The sandwich I got wasn't too heavy on the bagel dough, which I like. The bread was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The bacon also wasn't overpowering. I'm a small person and heavy breakfast foods generally make me sick, but this sandwich was delicious and just filled my stomach enough. They use real eggs, not from a carton. The cheese in the middle was perfectly melted as I opened up the slices. No, bagel fillings did not fall out of the sandwich as I was eating it. No, I did not get grease drippings all over my hands.

The bartender said no worried it's not a big deal if the owner or the manager come in she will throw that drink away!!seriously? I really won't hire people like this on my own restaurant so I give 2 stars for pre shucked oysters that sit in the room temp in the container with no ice! I hope I don't get sick from this. 2 stars for a Very simples seared salmon with simple salad they is nothing wrong with the dish but it took longer than 30 minutes to be serve and when I asked the server we still missing one dish she said it's a cook food so it will take longer than peeling strawberries or shucked oysters. What kind of attitude is this?  It doesn't take longer than 10 minute to cook a medium rare seared fillet salmon and salad. Bad bad service!!,0.0
"Meh. 

For some reason, when my boyfriend is sick he craves BBQ. We decided to head over for lunch since a coworker suggested this place to me. I heard there is usually a crazy long line for this place so it was nice to just grab our food and chow. 

Something I did appreciate was that when we placed an order for 2 pounds of meat and 2 large sides, the counter guy told us that it would be too much for us. Thank you for saving us from buying TOO MUCH FOOD (is there ever such a thing?) but I was totally ready to give you my money and take the leftovers home for a killer omelette. Soon you'll read why I was even more grateful that he stopped us from getting so much food.

Brisket- I judge all BBQ places by how their brisket it bc it's a hard one to do right. Rub was good, but the meat was SUPER DRY. We got some small pieces of burnt ends that I savored. I guess I'm spoiled from Hometown BBQ's Brisket- see review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn?hrid=FCahcv7cCLgcWzaZKImlPA ... 

Berkshire Pork Belly- Pretty good! You can't really mess up pork belly. I also wish this was a little more tender but it was delicious with their Carolina vinegar BBQ sauce. I wish I had more of the PB. 

Beans- The brisket in the beans was moist bc it was sitting in the juices... so, I'll give you that Fette Sau. The beans were delicious. It was like they made pork and beans more luxurious, but with burnt ends. It was pretty hearty as well. I liked dipping my bread in the sauce 

German Potato Salad- I liked this so much because it was a good contrast from the beans, bbq, and meat. I usually also get potato salad at bbq joints bc coleslaw is a waste of space... except when its on Chili and a Hotdog. 

I'll definitely be back to try more meats and sides because one can only eat so much in one sitting. Don't worry, I will change my reviews accordingly.

Cons: there's so many customers that it's difficult to know where lines for the prep stations begin or which customer is next to get serviced.

"Let me preface this by saying, I hate Rite Aid.  No, I don't harbor some personal vendetta against the chain that I passive-aggressively express via a Yelp review.  This is as objective as they come.  The Rite Aid chain (at least in New York) is simply horrendous.  

I can't express how pharmacy-dependent I am.  I'm always sick, preventing an imminent cold or just in need of something that pharmacy's tend to carry.  So, I can safely say I've been to many branches, of every huge pharmacy chain (Rite Aid, CVS, Duane Reade, etc). 

Now - on to the business at hand.  This Rite Aid branch (like many of its sister branches) is a pitiful mess.  It is horribly understaffed, unorganized, and almost consistently a pigsty.  

I've never once come here without waiting at least 15-20 minutes on line.  The lines are long, the cashiers are few, and the rest of the staff just lingers.  I've seen employees standing behind the counter, singing or rapping, and refusing to open up another cash register.  

I came in one time looking to get a passport photo taken.  There was ONE cashier attending to a parade of customers.  And that's it - nobody else. I walked around the entire store, in and out of every aisle, looking for somebody - anybody - to assist me.  Nope.

"Let me start this review by saying that this has been my favorite place to eat for the past year... until today. 

I have gone here so often that when I walk in, the guy I usually order from (who I believe is named Angel) begins making my order immediately. He is always sweet and professional and the food has always been great. 

Today I ordered the same thing as usual, but was incredibly disappointed when I got home. Firstly, the sandwich just looked horrible (picture attached). I've never seen anything put together so messily. I took a bite and immediately realized they had used American cheese - American cheese makes me sick, so I always get cheddar). Additionally, the bacon was so undercooked I had to spit the bite out. It was honestly one of the worst sandwiches I have EVER had. I called immediately and I believe I spoke to Angel, who said of course they can remake it.

I walked back (through the snow) feeling pretty happy - I've never had an issue with them before and knew they'd take care of me.

When I got back, however, the man who helped me was incredibly rude. He insisted over and over that it was Cheddar cheese - not to sound like a dick, but that's bull. Cheddar and American cheese don't look, taste or feel the same. At all. He was really mean about it - after I'd say something, he'd just stare at me without responding at all. Finally, I told him whoever I spoke with on the phone said they could remake the sandwich and could he please just remake it for me. He responded ""Well, yes the bacon may be undercooked but that's Cheddar cheese"". 

He took the sandwich back and they began remaking it. He IMMEDIATELY began speaking in rapid Spanish (sounding very angry) to everyone else who was working there, and looking at me. I know for a fact that he was talking about me and it made me feel absolutely awful. I don't think it's wrong to ask them to remake something that is clearly made incorrectly (regardless of the cheese situation - the sandwich is prepared poorly).

The new sandwich had cheddar on it (and, to be honest, was delicious)- the difference between the cheeses was almost laughable. I couldn't believe how rude he was and how insistent that they had made it correctly when the evidence clearly showed otherwise. What happened to customer service?

I am so upset about this experience - this has been my favorite diner for so long. I went here ALL the time. Will never return here again.",0.0
"I was so excited about this place: sick music, dark DIY atmosphere, great beer. 
Seemed really chill until after just the first round I asked for a glass of water and the bartender refused because my group gave him a ""shitty tip."" 
We were giving him 20-30%. 
So I handed him a $10 bill and said can I please just have some water. 
He said no and he actually wanted our group to leave immediately. 
We had only been there for maybe a half hour, we were planning to go for another round, and we weren't being loud or at all obtrusive. It was so bizarre.

I really wanted to like this place, but I have never experienced such outright hostility from a server, bartender or otherwise. 

Bottom line, wouldn't recommend unless you happen to carry enough cash to tip at least 50% per round.",0.0
"Definitely offers the healthiest and most diverse line up of fresh juice in the area. I was sick for most of winter and so I'd drop by to get me some of that ""ginger ale"" to clear my sinuses.

"I was hanging out in a UES apartment and was looking for some place cool to check out nearby. I found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go. I was a fan of Bao Haus in the Village, so a place that was closer, bigger, and less crowded? Awesome!

When I went, it still definitely looked like an Eddie Huang, even if not an original. But the hip-hop vibes and fusion bao is a winning formula in my book, so I went for it.

Both of these aspects were well done. They must have put some effort into their sound system, as you don't get a set of sick trap drops like that with a pair of walmart speakers. And the food, of course, was great.

I ended up getting a Hungry Buddhist and a beef & scallion pancake. Both of these were great; simply amazing. The hoisin sauce in the pancake complimented a dish that is amazing if done just right. And the hungry buddhist left me feeling just right - not too greasy, but ""meaty"" enough to fill me up.

I had a great experience here and I highly recommend it for everyone if you're in the area. Bao that will have you saying ""D-D-D-Damn son, where'd you find this?""",0.0
"Everything in this Italian restaurant is GLUTEN FREE. I'm celiac so I literally can't eat gluten, not by choice but because it makes me very sick. This place felt like PARADISE. Here I can pick anything from the menu without worries. The food was DELICIOUS! I have Italian family and learnt to eat real and good food since I was a kid. We ordered risotto (one with duck, another with shrimp and another with bacon & chicken). The three plates were amazing! For dessert we had nutella crepes and tiramisu. Everything was PERFECTLY DONE AND SUPER TASTY! The chef is a Mexican man that has over 20 years of experience working in NYC in different restaurants. He was our star for the evening! The manager was very nice too!",0.0
"Here's the thing.  I go to Mason Jar ALL the time because it's near my office.  I've recently realized the following:

Their lunch menu is very limited.  They don't serve nachos at lunch.  They've obviously got the ingredients, so I find that a bit mind boggling.

The service is SO slow.  It's never very busy, so I also find that strange.

On more than one occasion their credit card machine was ""down"".  It's 2015.  Get it together.

They're randomly out of staple foods, like french fries and kale.

On average, the food is good.  They serve Magners which is nice.  But honestly, I'm sort of sick of spending my money at this place.",0.0
"Let me preface this with a bit of positive before the storm. The interior around Christmas season (or maybe it's always like this?) is super decorated with THE MOST shit you'll probably ever see in a restaurant. It's nice and festive. Also the portions here are pretty hefty, so Rolf's has that going for em.

Okay, here's the reason why I gave the place one star. I came here with my parents and no matter when or where my dad orders steak, he orders it medium well. ""No blood,"" he always insists. It's just how he likes his steaks - bloodless and medium well. Cool. I like them medium rare but you know, he can do him, right?

WRONG, says the chef of Rolf's. We were sitting around waiting for our food for a good 40 minutes after ordering, and my dad asks the waiter where our food is. Cue the chef coming out of the kitchen to tell my dad, ""You order medium well steak, no? Well, medium well take time. It take at least 20 minute."" And we're like well it's been 40... and the dude just KEEPS insisting that it's my dad's fault for ordering medium well. He also keeps insisting that my dad should have ordered medium rare, because ""it's the best way"".  

Five minutes later, the steak gets plopped in front of my dad. A minute after eating, the chef comes out again and asks him, ""So how's the steak?"" to which my dad just kinda says ""Good... but a little burnt"", which it was. The whole top and bottom were charred entirely. The chef then goes ""Well YEA, you ordered medium well, that's what happens. You should always order medium rare."" He repeated that statement 5 more times.

Then the chef proceeds to stand around my family, inquiring where my parents come from. When they responded ""Boston"", he was like ""No no, I mean REALLY come from."" At this point, we were all weirded out, disgusted, and tired of this guy. My mom thought telling him ""China"" would get him to fuck off but NO. He then proceeds to inquire where in China we are from, even though it is quite clear by now we're sick of his gross invasion of our privacy. When my mom finally says Beijing, he says ""Oh I've been to Beijing! Are you actually from Beijing?"" and he repeats that question at least 5 more times, before showing us several pictures on his iPad of where he stayed in Beijing. He got uncomfortably close to my mom and my friend while showing us these pictures. WHILE WE WERE EATING OUR DINNER.

This was the most ridiculous display of horribly invasive service I've ever seen at a restaurant. Not only did he TELL a customer what they should have ordered instead, but he told a customer he was wrong for ordering something. What kind of chef does that???

"GHETTO GHETTO GHETTO

This place gets a one star because of the crowd! I use to come here all the time for lunch/dinner/drinks, it's in MY neighborhood & convenient. Lately I've gone had to deal with ghetto people staring at me, making loud noises, and being completely disrespectful. Maybe they come for the cheap drinks and food, who knows...what I do know is after they have their cheap drinks & food they come down residential blocks causing trouble, loud noises, robberies, and fights, I've seen several fights on my block with people who have just came from this restaurant. I don't pay extremely high rent (no I'm not rent stabilization, or control) to deal with people from other neighborhoods causing trouble! If I wanted to feel like I live in the ghetto, I would have moved there! Every weekend there's a problem, every weekend there's a fight, robbery, car damage, or loud music being played from cars that they park on residential streets. It's not cool that I don't feel safe in my own neighborhood or block because of this restaurant! I understand that the restaurant can't discriminate, but residents are sick of it! It use to be SAFE to walk on fifth avenue at night, now we aren't feeling that way! Because God knows if a fight is going to break out, or are you going to be harassed by the crowd there. 

Word of advise to the owner, do something! Because people are getting tired of it, and before we start going to the board, or before something big happens and you get shut down!",0.0
"i freaking HATE this place, but i go here often b/c there are no grocery stores in this neighborhood still!  i will go to santo's farm as often as possible, but sometimes i need some other stuff that he doesn't offer and i'm kind of getting sick of the children's math lessons while standing in line.  

CHECK the expiration dates on everything here...most of the stuff is close to spoiling and the produce is pretty much crap...even though it might look OK from a distance.  the prices are also INSANE for the quality.  avoid the repackaged items like dried fruit and nuts...marked up beyond belief and i'm pretty sure whoever is stocking them doesn't use gloves.  

a word of advice to the staff:  i know that you are a high school kid working the cash register at a grocery store and life is tough...but will it kill you to smile?  will it kill you to pack a bag in some sort of order where my tomatoes won't be mushed by the time i get home?  will it kill you to say one..or two...coherent sentences while making eye contact?  if you don't want to be working a cash register at Gourmet Fresh forever maybe TRY getting your stuff together?  maybe...just try?",0.0

"King Noodle!!!! I have to send my compliments to the chef here. If you're sick of your old repertoire of cuisines, you've gotta go to King Noodle! Their menu is so unique, it's unlike any Asian style restaurant out there. I've been consistently impressed with every plate they have!! 

First, the kimchee carbonara was Perfect. A crazy unique combo of flavors, I've never had anything quite like this. The sauce was so tasty! 

The marinated beef skewers were the highlight of dinner, for me. The highlight of the last few dinners I've had! The steak is so tender, and the marinade- freaking delicious. I want more. 

Okay, the chili fries are also a MUST- I can't describe how good these are. We were scraping the plate at the end!! 

Not only their food, but the drinks were awesome too! The Grand mariner The scorpion bowl.. That's all I can say :)

"Sick of the terrible service of the rude and crazy crew from this food place.  I decided to order take out and go feed my kids (the food is okay, just the people working there are wiredo.)    When I got there pick up my food at 5pm on a Saturday.  Four waiter/waitress standing there and talk to each other.  Fine, let me go pay and pick up my food and go ( mind my own business).

I went pay with the lady cashier (should be the owner of family member of owner).  She took my money and ran away.  I asked the guy with grey hair; ""Where is my take-out order of food, can I have it please?""  This guy got no response; acted like a tree/ treeman.  Holy cow.  And the other staffs were just keep talking their personal issue.  WTF, I had no choice, they gave me no receipt; I need to get my food from the cashier lady who just took my cash and intentionally given my no no no no receipt.

Finally, after I wasted my time standing there and listening to the four staffs talking about their personal issues again like usual and not doing their job (take care of customer, helloooo....).  I asked the cashier lady, ""Miss, I just paid you few minutes ago. Can I have my food that I paid? (Why she gave me no food but only took my money?). Now, here is  the funny park that makes my sick.  The cashier boss lady said to me: ""oh, they did not give you the food?""  Hey, what is that supposed to mean? (You took my money, are you suppose to finish up and take care of the customer before finishing the money part?).  Then, finally this lady got into the circle of the four staffs who had been talking about their personal issue and never look at the customers in this place for more than 10 minutes since I got in there.  This lady let the staffs keep talking; she gave me my food finally.  (What kind of management and service is this?).  I only can see this kind of show in this restaurant; if so busy yalking about personal issue; why come to work? Go take care it first, please. ( do not treat anyone like nothing)

"We walked away ambivalent as it felt like this place was trying a little too hard.  It's like when you meet people for the first time and he/she is wearing too much perfume/cologne, has on too much make-up (either sex applies), overly manicured eyebrows, too much Botox around the pouty lips, or too much silicone, signaling with overly-branded clothes, etc.

Feeling like an old fart bitching about how loud it is in here, but it's impossible to have a conversation as the music is aggressively, almost obnoxiously loud.  And with everybody yelling to try to impress their dates with useless information about their lives, the volume just ratchets higher.

We tried a bunch of dishes - probably too many...most of the food felt overly flavored and the most memorable part was the more subtle herby lentil salad.  We also had the marinated white anchovies, twice cooked duck, the pappardelle, and Brussels sprouts.  Once every now and then you get sick of eating as the flavors are too heavy and you hit the wall.  We hit that after two bites of the entrees and zombie walked thru the rest of it. The desserts were well presented but ultimately not that interesting.

We'll give this place points for service and effort but not sure if we're coming back any time soon...sorry.",0.0

Anyway, my friends and I were seated once a table opened up and given our menus. We decided on a mix of wings and drums and zucchini fries.

As far as the food goes, not as good as I remember, but still good. If you have never tried it, give it at least one chance. Service was eh...waiters weren't very responsive.

"Let me start with this disclaimer: Little Dirt Candy was my favorite restaurant ever.  So when Chef Amanda Cohen announced her opening for Big Dirt Candy I was so excited.  I set an alarm for 9am on February 3rd, when reservations would go live on Open Table.  I felt an obligation to go early and let them work out the kinks on a true believer.  There was no need, everything was amazing.  I got a reservation for Friday.  It was a cold night in NYC and big DC has a comfortable bar area to wait for a table, this was the first improvement.  There were quite a few times that I showed up a bit early at little DC for a reservation and had to wait outside for my table.  The next thing that struck me was the gorgeous open kitchen.  It's bigger than the old restaurant.  Chef Amanda was prepping a Chocolate Onion tart near the bar and gave us a welcoming, familiar smile.  We chatted for a bit and she was off.  Once you had been to Little DC a few times you couldn't help but feel like you knew her a bit.  After all, she was probably taking your order,  bringing your food or pouring your wine, possibly all three. 

The old favorite snack of jalapeño hush puppies is still available but the new addition of Korean Fried Broccoli sounded like a must, it was.  The broccoli was perfectly fried and I could have put away the whole bowl.  Do yourself a favor, get both snacks.  The appetizers were perfect.  The potato salad is great and I had a kale matzo ball from my wife's soup, I want a plate of them.  We shared the Brussel Sprout tacos which I loved.  Each ingredient come separate and you can build your own tacos.  Every combination is amazing.  For dessert my wife had the aforementioned chocolate Onion Tart and I had the Vegetable Ice Cream Salad.  The onion tart was quite good but the ice cream was amazing.  Each flavor was more wonderful than the previous one.  But the highlight of it was the walnut cake croutons and the golden beet ice cream, I could eat that everyday and never get sick of it.  

So when I said that Little Dirt Candy used to be my favorite restaurant, I wasn't saying that it no longer was because it had closed.  It's because Big Dirt Candy is my new favorite.  Although, I do miss the walls at Little DC that looked like Matzo. 

Congratulations Chef Amanda Cohen, and Thank You!",0.0
"Completely rude & inconsiderate of them to continually put their sandwich board practically in the middle of sidewalk. And its also completely ILLEGAL, no biz in nyc is allowed to have any tables/chairs or signs more than 3 feet away from front of building. So if you too are sick of their carelessness, feel free to call 311 to file a complaint, & the city will inspect & fine them. It doesnt take long to do this, just have the above address ready, & u can remain anonymous if u want, either way the city never reveals identity of anyone making such complaints.

"I'll give this place a 3 for their brunch. It does get very crowded here, so I advise on making reservations.

My gf and i came here for brunch. I do have to admit that their brunch cocktail menu is pretty nice. I ordered the BLT Mary, and it was delish. I wish the bacon wasn't as fatty because when it's cold the rendered fat isn't as yummy, but the bloody mary itself was solid. Not the best, but not the worst. 

My gf ordered the cucumber soda 1st and then the canteloupe cooler. Both were very solid drinks. I actually really enjoyed the cucumber soda as it was very refreshing. 

Since my gf and I really do have a passion for food, we ordered 3 entrees..... Yes we ordered lemon ricotta pancakes as our appetizer! Don't judge! It actually wasn't that bad, and it pleasantly better than the pancakes that were served from Jane.

The chilaquiles and huevos rancheros..too be honest i'm not sure what the difference is. I ordered the chilaquiles, but if they came back and told me it was huevos rancheros, then I wouldn't disagree. I do admit they have both dishes on hte menu and the waiter indicated that chilaquiles are better. It was pretty much a LOT of tortilla chips, 2 slightly overcooked poached eggs, doused in tomatillo sauce that was yummy. The pickled jalapenos added some heat and the cotija cheese added some salt. Overall the dish was yummy, but it was just too much and you kind of get sick of it after a while. Plus it didn't help that the eggs were overcooked.

"Is there any way to give 0 star???

Outrageous is my first and only impression to the way how this seemingly popular restaurant treated its customers. From the right beginning when we walked into this restaurant, the atmosphere didn't feel right. We were seen as 'invisible' by the staff there even though several tables were already cleaned up and ready to serve. The waitress skipped us anyway, and started serving the person who arrived after us. Hey, come on, are you blind???

We had to ask for being seated. However, you know what, we were even not allowed to choose where to seat. Funny, right?!

During the entire stay, we were treated as 'invisible'. No staff served us water, or, even made an apology for not being attentative. We were just treated like third-class citizens. 

Finally, we raised our voice to get the attention from everyone who was dining there. This time the staff there was no longer DEAF and BLIND. But again, they just don't care about customers. Their attitude just really made people sick and pissed off!

So, we cannot speak for the food quality there. But, if you want to have 'invisible' experience, we will definitely recommend this restaurant!!!",0.0
"Was sick and needed a cookie and ice cream to feel better so I had to give this place a try!  Hot fresh cookies delivered to your door?!? Yes please!

Ordered online and had a coupon for 10% off.  Got a mixed variety of cookies.  Ordering was easy, delivery was fast, and the cookies were hot and toasty when they arrived!  They didn't have the ice cream I ordered but the store called to ask if I would want a different flavor. 

Everything was delicious - would def order again!  Cookies had a good amount of filling/chocolate pieces and were reasonably sized.  Could see this being nice to order at the end of the night if you're at a friends and forgot dessert.  (Or just because, warm cookies are the best).",0.0
One of the worst experiences I have ever had in the city. The bartender/waitress was deathly ill but said the manager didn't care about infecting customers of the restaurant. Spoke with manager who didn't care she was sick and said staff was low. Worst off I got a bill for the most inflated drinks I have ever seen in New York London Miami or Dubai. 50 dollars for a shot that's 16 other places. This place was totally empty in a trendy area on a Thursday night. Don't recommend.,0.0
"I was really confused after being here once why people were so negative about this location. In my sleepy/sick/dying state, it didn't seem so bad. That was until I realized they didn't have much that I needed. 

The selection wasn't very good. Not the hair care products I wanted (popular black hair care brand found in any Rite Aid/Duane Reade I've been to) and  not the foundation I needed in my shade. 

They did, however, have the one most important thing I needed: Dayquil. Nothing crazy. Just a daytime cough syrup. It wasn't behind the pharmacy, or behind a glass container like some of the heavier meds. So, I picked it up, took it to the register to purchase. The cashier requested my ID. For an OTC medicine. I'm 30 years old. I didn't think I needed it to just pick up an OTC medicine. The teenage cashier said that he could ask his manager to see what she said about it. She looked at me and reiterated that they can't sell cold medicines without ID. I've never been carded for a non prescription/non-glass container medicine before. 

I walked a block away to a grocery store and bought Dayquil on my way home. I'm glad the area has some more dependable spaces when you're sick.",0.0
"First time in this store and hopefully my last. I walked in with my little one in his stroller both of us under the weather. The line was very long with only two cashiers until a third one got there there were more than 14 people before me. Baby was fussing and the items that I shopped were on the stroller canopy and some fell off. What appeared to be the manager some big guy named Velez-Perez (or vice versa) was just looking and didn't attempt to help. I was tempted from walking off but with sick babies I don't mess around. 

The gentleman in line behind me helped me and scolded the not so helpful person two feet from us, and says that he was doing serious surveillance security work for possible theft so he couldn't help. He thanks the man for helping me and keeps his James Bond work. 

The lovely useless roundish man tells me that this wouldn't have happened if I would have taken a basket or cart at the door. I just looked at him and responded 'how am I supposed to do that with a stroller?'  He said that then I'll have that problem everywhere then. 

I was pretty upset but needed the medicine. The man behind me says that his behavior is shameless. Then the roundish man tells us that because we made nothing into something that some guy probably walked out with a bunch of stuff. The man shook his head and said that it's shameful to blame us for someone stealing. 

I told him that if that was the case then he wasn't a good security guy. 

When I was walking out he said 'Be well' and frankly I just wanted to tell him that I'll never come back there, but frankly I don't thing to he cares. It's sad that a Latino will treat one of his people badly when we have much spending power. What a shame.",0.0
"I recently had an experience at City Bakery that left a feeling of not ever want to go back -   and I've been a customer there for 15 years. 
      It was one of those snowy, winter NYC weekend saturdays.   I went in for a for a good old grilled cheese sandwich.   The whole thing was astonishingly disorganized & inhospitable.   
     After waiting in line at the grilled cheese bar for 15 minutes,  with 2 or 3  people cutting in line in front of me,  I was still unfazed and just chalked it up with, oh well thats' just NY !
     But whe I  finally got to the front to order the sandwich,  there were only 2 types left in the case.   i asked the girl  if they could heat up the grilled cheese, and if they were getting more chicken and cheese,  and mushroom and cheese...   she kept saying          ""i don't know"" in a  who cares type of way,  and was clearly not interested in asking the chef who walked right by us about 3 times.  She obviously couldn't care less.
      Finally, hungry & a bit frustrated at this point,  I had been there for a half hour, with my wet coat on -    I went straight to the chef who  again walked by,    and asked  him  directly if he would mind heating up the only type of sandwich left, and he said sure, took it in the back, and brought it to me now at a table.
     I looked at the line to pay which was about 10 people long on both sides, I decided to take off my wet coat, and eat the warm cheese sandwich first and wait in yet another line,  after.
     As I was eating the sandwich finally ( ! ),  the owner Maury Rubin walked up to me in a fury -  and said that I didn't pay for the sandwich and was furious.
When I said I was planning on paying for it ( because why wouldn't i ?! ),  that I had been to his restaurant probably 50 times  and was an incredibly loyal fan,   he was unfazed and furious.
      The whole situation just immediately brought to mind the longing of the incredibly pleasant & incredible hospitality of going to any of the Danny Meyer restaurants.  
Is Maury Rubin jaded and just sick of being in the business?",0.0
"I rarely find myself in this section of New York, but was scheduled to tape a podcast appearance on a show that films at Otto's Shrunken Head.  The show was terrific fun, but as soon as I walked into this bar, I was asked for ID.  I laughed, because I'm 59 years old.  I asked the bartender if I should step into the light so she could see my wrinkles, and she started loudly proclaiming, ""It's not about age; if it were about age, I wouldn't have to ask,"" and then rudely insisted I show her ID.  Well I carry ID, of course, but not anything with my birthdate on it.  Why would I?  I clearly haven't seen 21 in decades.  The bartender then started insisting it was the law to carry ID in New York.  It is NOT the law in this state or in any state in the United States of America.  What an idiot.  Did you ever try to contradict a loud, belligerent person who insists she's right, when she isn't?  I had a credit card, which this establishment doesn't take (they take cash only), and I had work ID which includes my photo, but no birthdate as it's not relevant.  I don't drive and had no license.  Since I wasn't drinking anyway before the show, ultimately it didn't matter, but I wondered what the hell this chick thought her job was: to sell booze and create a friendly atmosphere ... or to repel potential customers?!  I read a free newspaper until my colleagues arrived, but then she started up again with me when she carded them.  She started loudly yelling that it ""was the law"" for everyone in NYC to carry ID and that I had been arguing about it ever since I walked in the door!   Not only was that absolutely not true, because I walked away and read for a half hour ... but then when I again showed her my work ID, to show her what she clearly missed the first time around --  that I worked for a police union (and knew a lot more about the topic than she did) -- she started yelling that it would be the same as showing the police her food handler license if I was arrested.  Why the hell would I get arrested?  I was 38 years over the drinking age ... and wasn't drinking!  She was so nasty, insane, rude, belligerent, and WRONG, that after we filmed the podcast, we all took our business a few blocks away to a lovely Italian restaurant where, of course, they did not card three middle-aged people.  And NO folks -- you do not have to carry ID in NYC.  Of course, it makes sense to carry something that identifies you, in case you get sick or hit by a car (in addition to my work ID, my credit card, and business cards, I wear a Medic Alert bracelet), but it does not have to include your birthdate, unless you look very young.  I would not visit this bar again if they gave a bottle of booze away with every peanut.  But of course they can't, because they don't serve peanuts: they serve no food here, either.   They only serve up aggravation.  What a hole!  Go someplace else.  NYC is full of wonderful places ... there is no need to visit this dive.",0.0
"This place is great for brunch.  I've been here twice and have ordered the sick and waffles both times. It's so delicious.  It was my first time trying anything with waffles, I didn't think I'd enjoy it but it was so juicy and crunchy at the same time. We also tried the burgers and boy those were great as well.  Loved their version of tater tots, little square bites with tarter sauce.

The atmosphere is great and they provide popcorn as the free smack prior to the meal. The popcorn seasoning is actually quite tasty, I wished I knew the exact seasoning!!

I'd definitely come,  most likely next weekend.",0.0
"Great salads, I'll give them that.  However, the fact that their delivery guy refuses to actually DELIVER to your apartment equals 1 star or less in my book. He makes you come down and meet him on the street.  This began when I was sick with the flu in the dead of winter, and since then I've always added a note that if they can't actually provide proper delivery service, to cancel my order.  Most times, one of the owners comes himself and is very cool, but the most recent time I ordered they said that the delivery guy ""didn't feel comfortable"" coming to my apartment and that he would cancel my order. FWIW, I live in an upscale, residential neighborhood, and the only thing this guy doesn't ""feel comfortable"" with is climbing stairs. 

It's really sad that since online ordering has become popular, and delivery people are tipped BEFORE they actually do any work, and feel entitled to a tip for doing half their job. I'm honestly amazed that this place has retained this guy, as he is HURTING their business. Your mileage may vary, of course, but my hope is that people who have lived in NY long enough and know how delivery is supposed to work, will stand up to slackers like this.",0.0
"Had the worst experience at this restaurant.

Am a strict vegetarian and they gave me food with Chicken, we only realized after accidentally eating it.

They brought a new one but didn't comp the dish and the OWNER was one of the rudest people I've met. She yelled at us for ten minutes about how they made a replacement which defeated the purpose. Meat made us sick.

"June 15, 2013

Went their for late lunch/early dinner.  Seated right away.  Very clean.  Friendly staff.  Our Waitress, Christine or Christina (If my memory is correct) was one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  Looked to be very young, but very pleasant, accomodating, and always smiling.  Personally, if I went back, I would surely request her.

The rest of the staff seemed really attentive as well.  Literally, my glass of water was refilled after one drink.  There was one waitress who, apparently, was upset at her schedule because her grandmother was sick, and it was her birthday.  Apparently, and I quote; ""She (I) don't care if they fire me.""  Didn't really feel it necessary for my date or I to hear about it, but seemed to be a high school girl, or recent graduate, so no big deal.

Food was plentiful, and really good.  The calamari was light, and fresh.  Sauce was a little bland for my taste, so added some hot sauce.  Still very, very good.

I ordered the Chicken Rollatini, and my date had the Chicken Marsala.  Although we tried our hardest to finish it there, we couldn't, and brought a good portion home.  Dessert was the Tiramisu.  Glad we stopped eating a little early to save some room.  Awesome.  

If in the area, we will defiinitely be back as it's right off the Southern State, and easy commute from Brooklyn.",0.0
"The Jagerschnitzel here is sick (in a good way).  First, it is HUGE!  Also crispy, crunchy and seasoned well.  Delicious  And the sauce. I can drink that mushroom sauce.  The sauce is awesome.  Great lively vibe with an all German playlist that is a mix of pop and some oompah music   Really big beer  selection of which there were some I didn't know.  

Have you ever tried a shot-ski?  Literally 4 shot glasses mounted on a ski and you and your friends turn  em up at once.  Only $20 and well worth it for the fun alone.  They also have  Das Boot.  girls in dirndls and  men in lederhosen.  You might  call me a beer hall enthusiast and this is literally  the most authentic German place I  have been to.  Completely awesome service too.  Prost",0.0
"Great gluten free options! I ordered the gluten free general tso's chicken and it was delicious. More importantly, I didn't get sick from any cross contamination.

"Came here with my boyfriend for our 3 year anniversary. Let me just say that, usually whenever we go to a fancy restaurant, the prices are very high and the portions are very small. However, this is NOT the case with The Water Club! The portions are massive! My boyfriend couldn't even finish his steak, so we took it to go. (Granted, it was a 24oz steak). I ordered the rack of lamb and it was so delicious.

The atmosphere is amazing, and the view is beautiful! The only thing we didn't like was the fact that the restaurant was rocking back and forth because of the water, so we were getting a little sea sick.

Highly recommend if you have a special occasion coming up!",0.0
"I recently turned 21 and someone gave me a Groupon package for 4 people to the Ice Bar. Naturally, I was excited because the idea seemed so cool and different. I brought my boyfriend and 2 other people. We previously looked up the place online to get an idea of what it would be like and it looked sick. For one thing, the bar looked HUGE - with different themed ice rooms, awesome drinks, a photographer, etc. We figured we would spend a good amount of time there, so we arrived pretty early. 



To our surprise and disappointment, the Ice Bar was ONE, VERY TINY room. We weren't allowed to bring our phones in, which would've at least made the experience a little better if we could take some of our own pictures. The drinks were very overpriced, with not many options, and very minimal alcohol. We were completely sober when we arrived since we thought we'd spend a lot of time there, and honestly, you'd need at least 4 or 5 drinks to feel any buzz at all - this means you'd be spending at least $60 on drinks on top of your entrance fee (which I didn't pay since it was a gift). Still, the experience I thought this would be was not at all what it ended up being. Anyways, we laughed it up and enjoyed what we could of the night and went off to another (real) bar after about 45 minutes to have real drinks. Somewhat glad I got to experience it but definitely happy it was a gift and I didn't waste my money on it.",0.0
"I would definitely come back here again.

You would not know of this place's existence because there's no real sign at the entrance.  If you look at the pictures, you'll see that it will be very easy to pass by without noticing that it is a place where you can order food.  You'll only know about this place if 1. you are reading these reviews on Yelp.  2.  you heard about it from somewhere else.  3. you are in the area and see a lot of people go in so you decide to check it out.

I went inside and the guy asked me if it was my first time there.  I said it was, and he instantly recommended the chicken sandwich, which consists of fried chicken, buttermilk biscuit, cole slaw, and gravy.  I went with his recommendation, and ordered it to go.  The place was very interestingly decorated.  Minus 0.5 stars because while I was waiting for the sandwich, I was looking at the papers on the wall which promoted a lot of events in the city - but some of them already happened about a month ago.  The guys were both really friendly and the music choice was on point.  The vibe of the place was sick, so plus 0.25 stars for that.  The price came out to be $7.10 after tax, which I didn't like because I paid $8 and got 90 cents back in coins.  My wallet was crying because it didn't want to hold all of these coins, so minus 0.25 stars for that.

So I took the sandwich to go, and ate it outside nearby where there was a chair.  And I felt lucky; there was a fight going down on the street so I was eating my sandwich while witnessing the fight, under the nice, breezy and warm weather.  The sandwich was delicious, which I expected because I read the reviews prior to going to the place.  But one thing I did not like was that a lot of the cole slaw fell out of the sandwich easily once I removed the wrapping - and some of the dressing stuck to the wrapping.  So I had to lick it off and people were watching me like I was crazy.  So minus 0.5 stars for that.

I highly recommend this place.  I will be coming here again and trying out all of the other sandwiches.  Next time, I will probably bump my rating up to five stars.",0.0
"This is a perfect happy hour bar for me. It might get fratty on weekends but it was perfect right after work on a Monday. There's music (pretty good music too!) and a juke box, but the volume isn't too high to hear one another and have real conversation. There are a few separate spaces -- a back room (there was a private event so I didn't get a good look at it), a middle room/hallway with large comfy booths (we sat here) and a front room (where the bar is) with plenty of small tables and bar stools. This separation allows a more private vibe if you want one. The beers on tap were great and the selection seemed totally solid. I didn't have any cocktails so no comments on that yet. But the food was really solid! Definitely a few steps above even GOOD standard bar food. The chips and guacamole came with two spicy, tasty salsas and the guac tasted fresh. The fried cheese balls are sick. My company had burgers and seemed pleased.",0.0
"I didn't notice the Health Dept. ""Grade Pending"" sign till after my wife and I ordered lunch to eat in at this takeout place. I can happily say I didn't get sick -- and that was the best thing about this awful place. My $13.50 BBQ combo platter featured lukewarm BBQ chicken, and fried ""mahi-mahi"" that seemed strangely white and flaky and not fleshy like mahi-mahi is. The iced tea seemed made from a powdered mix, with a strong taste of sugar substitute. And -- oh, yeah -- they not only slipped in a higher price for the drinks than the giant overhead sign behind the counter gave, but then argued with me when I pointed it out ... for all of $1.50! They got their revenge, though, when my wife asked them to wrap up her leftovers to go -- and instead they threw them out! Avoid at all costs.",0.0
"My daughter and I visited the Meow Parlour without an appointment because we were in the area and we are extreme cat lovers.  Fortunately they let us in, but the man behind the counter was rude and serious.  If you are going to run a pet friendly establishment, hire people who love people too.

There were only 10 cats there and most of the were either sleeping or probably sick of being handled and played with.  I picked up one cat and got a dirty look from one of the guys who works there. It's supposed to be a place where you can play and handle the cats.  They need more kittens who love to play and nicer employees.

It's a very small place and very disappointing.  Also, I realize it's for a great charity, but $18 for two people to sit around watching cats sleep is outrageous  So happy I didn't come into the city just for this,  What a waste of money and time.  I give it a year.",0.0
"If you are trying to booze hard at brunch, don't go here.  The only options as part of the unlimited special are Bloody Mary's and mimosas.  That would typically be totally fine but when we were brought our pitchers of mimosas, they were basically orange juice.  I am not exaggerating; the seven of us had to stop drinking and we were all stone sober.  We were sick of sugary orange juice and couldn't handle anymore.  When we poured the drinks, it didn't even fizz.  

Although this was far from a boozy brunch, the food was great and the service was amazing.  The staff is so friendly and made us feel welcome. The steak sandwich was delicious and if I were to go back, I would go back just for that.  Also, the price for the unlimited brunch is super cheap but it's likely due to the fact that they go very light in the champagne space.",0.0
"4 stars for the food; but about 3 for the service.

I was excited to give this place a try the next time I found myself in this area. Perhaps I walked in at an off moment, there were 2 tables that had to be cleared so I had to wait a moment for seating. No problem, but the server decides to lay down the flatware for all the empty tables before giving me my setting and then I had to wait to get the menu. Didn't receive the specials menu that I saw others received nor did I get the complimentary veggies that are mentioned in other reviews. I did see them handed out to other tables (both for a solo diner and a table of 2) so I'm not sure why I was skipped over and by the time I noticed that other tables did receive them to start; I was given my order. 

The positives - I ordered the build your own biscuit with fried chicken and gravy. It was delicious! i was afraid the sausage gravy with the chicken would compete with each other but it didn't - everything worked well together. The plate was heavy, but the portion was just about right so you can still walk out without feeling sick. Also, tried the prickly pear lemonade and it was refreshing. The restaurant was a bit warm but tolerable after acclimating to the temperature. There was another server who was attentive and checked in frequently. I think I will give this place another try if I have a biscuit and gravy craving while in this area but maybe I'll grab my order to go.",0.0

"This place is a gem deep in the overrun Nolita Sea of mediocre, pseudo-hip restaurants. It offers truly unique fusion dishes with the freshest ingredients and skillfully constructed presentations. The only reasons for 4 out of 5 are: 1. It's WAY too expensive. It might be amazing, but I was almost insulted at the prices, especially for such small portions. And 2. Our adorable Aussie server seemed to be the ONLY server on the floor on a Saturday night - so service was M A D - S L O O O W W... But maybe someone was sick and they had no replacement. I can't say. It wasn't the servers fault, she was great - it was obvious she could not physically keep up with every table all by herself. I doubt anyone could. 

Favorites were:
Basically every appetizer - smoked eggplant bruschetta, fried olives, crispy cauliflower. All were amazing. Fresh and unique to the max. My Dad loved the short ribs, my Moms had an amazing Ramp Spaghetti, and my Red Snapper was the tastiest I have ever had - hands down.

"I happened to stumble upon this bakery on my way to meet a friend. I had been actually craving a Magnolia Bakery slice of cake so I decided to try something different and less crowded. This shop in particular is pretty small so I had to take my cupcakes to go.

I ended up getting two red velvets and a salted caramel. The girl in the shop didn't seem very  enthusiastic or friendly but she did actually go through the motions of speaking and telling me to have a nice day (maybe she was sick or just having a bad day who knows!)

I have to say, I loved the frosting. It tasted fresh and homemade but the cupcake part was so dry! Both cupcake flavors weren't moist at all, I felt like I could have made the same quality cupcake at home, possibly better.

I will say they offer a wide selection of unique flavors, a lot of things you don't see on a regular basis so if you're looking for something different you might wanna check them out. Maybe I just went on an off day.",0.0
"I am so sick of pretentious Manhattan bullsh#t. 

I went here last night for my friends going away party. I went up to the bartender, smiled and said ""hi"". I got the usual blank stare which seems to be ""de rigueur"" these days for Manhattan industry folk. WTF. We were there for a good time, spending our hard earned cash AND we were industry. 

I work in the biz and this is unacceptable behavior. I hope the owners of Manhattan bars/restaurants will come to see the light and stop allowing this rudeness. You are in the SERVICE industry. You're job is to make people feel welcome!

This is how you treat your customers? I seriously wanted to climb across the bar and shove the bartenders ""Ray Bans"" up his a##. Girl please. Go back to whatever shi##y midwest town you're from and take your attitude with you. I came here from Brooklyn for this?

"Food was average, pretty mediocre Korean BBQ. Service was pretty bad in general but what really got on my nerves was the dishonest staff (in particular the waiter we had - Korean dude with glasses). 

Reasons for the poor review:

1. We wanted to order a bowl of rice, pretty standard item that many customers order at a korean restaurants and something that is easy to make and is usually never in short supply. Our waiter tells us that they ""ran out of rice""...strange but we thought nothing of it. He then upsells is to a noodle dish instead which costs over 5x as much. Literally about 2 minutes later, we see another waiter delivering rice to another table! Seriously man, you're really gonna lie to your customers like that? What makes things worse is he tried to charge us for 2 bowls of rice on our bill on top of our noodle dish. When we call him out on it, there was no apology.

2. They have this egg/cheese/corn ring that goes around the grill. Our egg was not cooking at all (it was still watery at the end of our meal). My friends and I were confused about whether the semi-raw egg was OK to eat. We ask our waiter if it's ready and he tells us it's cooked and good to eat - I thought better off it and didn't eat it. Later after we are done eating and ready to leave, we look over all the table next to us, who happened to have just sat down, and their egg is fully cooked! We ask our sleazy waiter why that is the case and he tells us that our grill just wasnt working properly. WTF dude - thats the kind of information you should be upfront with to customers before telling them to eat undercooked eggs. That kind of behavior is going to get someone sick. I smell a lawsuit coming....

3. We ask how long the wait is when we arrive. There are a few open tables but they tell us 10-15 minutes and suggest we wait by the bar (which has no seats and is just a tiny little chaotic area in the corner, right where the servers go in and out of. Thinking we are going to be waiting around for 10-15 minutes, we order some beers. Of course as soon as we order and pay for our drinks, our table is ready....coincidence? Normally I wouldn't think anything of this but all the other shady things that went on here leaves me feeling suspicious.

4. This one is from 2nd hand information so take it with a grain of salt. My friend comes back from the bathroom and tells us that he's fully convinced the staff member from the restaurant who used the bathroom right before him did not wash his hands. He came to this conclusion because when he went in after the staff member was done, the toilet was still running just as if it was just flushed making it very unlikely that the employee has enough time to actually wash his hands.

"Cons: Place is packed with 2300+ SAT score Columbia kids.
In hindsight, most of the prior reviews for this place are penned by this same crowd...hungry, cash poor, and too tired to venture any further from class.
We ordered three lunch specials, curry chicken, basil chicken and the bellwether, Pad Thai.
Within a minute of ordering, we each had a plate of veggie spring rolls 'tossed' at us. Clearly, these things had been cooked well in advance and were probably sitting in a heap in the back. Tepid and greasy.
Twenty minutes later, two of our meals were again dropped on the table (it's like a game and diners gets to figure out who's food is who's), only to be followed by our third main almost ten minutes later.
The 'spicy' curry chicken was notable only for the fact that it contained relatively no chicken and certainly wasn't spicy. 
The basil chicken dish was decent,
The Pad Thai was a plate of fish sauce-soaked noodles with not much else recognizable mixed within.

 However, the food was BARELY mediocre. The seared tuna in the Niçoise salad tasted too fishy and the artichoke hearts were old, nearly having an unappetizing and sickening powder texture. My friends ""truffle"" Mac and cheese did not have a lick of that flavor.
Maybe we went on a bad day or time but I was very disappointed.",0.0
Visited this restaurant 3 days in a row. Only reason is that it's so good to find a place to heal my home sickness. Authentic Taiwan bento matches perfectly with bubble tea. I recommend pork belly and fried chicken leg.,0.0
"Came here at least 3 or 4 times already and I always get the Honey Glazed Steak that comes with fried rice. I just wished they had a better rating.. They have a C. I usually prefer A's, B's are border line, but C I'm a little scared. In the end I didn't feel sick in my stomach so I hope they get a better rating unless it's the other food.",0.0
"Some friends took us around Flushing to some of their favorite Chinese food spots that reminded them of home. We were pretty full, but they wanted us to check out Fat Ni BBQ Cart. 

When I eat food from an outside food cart I cross my fingers and pray that I don't get sick. However, when I saw that they offered lamb skewers I was willing to take a risk because I have a bit of a lamb obsession. *They've got the magic sticks* I know if I can eat it once, I can eat it twice. Lamb skewers were addicting and delicious! So was the beef, chicken, and squid. 

It's not the healthiest and this isn't something that I would hit up daily, but this cart is super affordable at $1.50 per skewer.",0.0
"So here is another one of those small places seating- and standing around-wise, one of those typical, lovely order and take-out food joints in the Village between Washington Square and Houston Street and between Houston and Spring Street, where maybe 8 people can sit while the rest stand and try not to block the next customer waiting to order, standing outside to eat at the open air entrance upon getting their pizza and drink if not going off elsewhere. The atmosphere is nice otherwise: low-key incandescent lighting and a big subway transit map framed on the wall. The various pies all look nice put up bare on the counter front behind glass by the register, where the man cuts out cleanly the individual slices before putting them in the oven.

Plain cheese is $1, while everything with a topping is $2--save meat or veggie protein ($3); drinks are $1.25; a cheese pie, meanwhile, is $10; the logic eludes me, too.

But price and space isn't my big qualm here. It's this: Percy's has a C rating from the NYC Health Department, the lowest acceptable one there is, and as of less than two months ago. That made me pretty concerned, especially when I read that there was evidence of rodent presence. 

I haven't gotten sick from Percy's, and I don't know anyone who has, and the double cooked pizza slices have well-melted cheese and delicious crust--softly bready but thin enough to be simultaneously brittle and crispy--and the guy made me 6 pies once from dough-stage in less than 15 minutes (and all 60-something people loved it, too), but it's hard to be comfortable eating food cooked by someone else in a place that's reportedly crawling with stuff. Despite the turn on of the good pizza, and despite my love for Pixar's Ratatouille, this rodent thing is a big turnoff..........",0.0
"Let me just start by saying I am in serious cold pressed juice withdrawl!!!  When I stumbled upon these incredibly friendly Chocotoy boys 3 months ago handing out free samples of their juice, I thought, ok more juice peddlers.  Then I tasted ALL of the free samples and instantly wanted more, more, more.  I became as much of a regular fixture at their tent at the Astoria Flea Market as they were and can't believe that their tenure at the flea is now over.  I hope they are able to open a store that I can walk into regularly (honestly they will probably get sick of seeing me)!  Their juices are refreshing, have a great depth of interesting flavor combinations and very energizing.  Here's to the Chocotoy boys of summer continuing to juice our fall, winter and spring!",0.0
"This place is great. Great frozen margaritas, super vibes and there's always something fun going on. The place inside is pretty cavernous, really charming (looks like the inside of a train car) and they have a super cool eagle's nest above the bar that you can throw private parties in. 
There's also an awesome stand up comedy show every Tuesday and it's FREE. This is the best spot to hang out in the neighborhood.

"Mmmm I just love red mango... Def an acquired taste as their yogurt is more ""tart"" than others.. Better than pink berry ! Also, this particular establishment caught my eye today bc they serve soups !!! Today's special was chicken and dumpling and lobster bisque (there was one more but I can't remember right now)... So happy and in my glory bc soups and fro yo are both some of my favorite things to eat especially since I'm sick (hmph).. Anyway I opted for the chicken and dumpling it was nice and sort of creamy with a veg medley I really enjoyed it... Followed by a plain yogurt w granola all for like $8.. Clean little spot located conveniently on steinway in the middle of all of your little shops.. I've also had the peanut butter banana smoothie with granola added it's amazing (if you like those flavors lol) they also serve really good French macaroons here ! Love those!

"This is one of the best wine stores in the area. You can't even compare it with the others because of its selection and the knowledgable staff. Seriously, it makes a difference. I went into this first wine store with a picture of a wine trying to get that specific bottle and the guy tells me he doesn't carry that vendor but that he had a lower priced chianti that might be up my alley. I tell him I want this specific and he says ""we have other chianti."" I never have this problem with the guys at Park Wines.

Plus, given their sick wine collection, you can score some major deals if you buy 12 bottles (be sure to throw in some $60 bottles as I ended up saving $96 in total). Waiting to go back to stock up.",0.0
"Ground zero of the current broth craze sweeping the nation, Brodo is definitely worth a stop if you want to see what this trendy bone-lust is all about. 

Both the chicken and hearth broths were great, with the hearth slightly better due to its complexity and intensity of flavor. To be honest though, the chicken broth here is really simple and delicious and clean, so if I were sick or just really cold and tired I might actually go with this one. 

Both broths were a really deep brown and actually have a pretty respectable amount of salt, fat and body. I think they roast the bones in an oven before steeping them in the water. The broth feels way more substantial when you are consuming it than you think it will. Like you can get legit full on a large cup of this stuff.

Due to the fact that it is currently getting cold outside and this little window is in a high-traffic area, there's always a bit of a line. I got in a two person line here at 4:15 and when I left like maybe ten minutes later there were about 12 people behind me, so folks are definitely catching on.

Tbh who knows how many health benefits are actually in broth as it is pretty much what you think it will be: salty tasty soup broth. But boy, is it some outstanding broth.",0.0
"The only reason I'm giving this ""mexican"" restaurant 2 stars is because the drinks were awesome and the owner was our server and apologized profusely about our experience. 

That said -- we waited close to an hour and a half for a two-top (it's popular - not sure why) and when we did get seated we had no waitstaff attention. No silverware, no water, nothing. The restaurant was obviously having a hard night since the guy who had I be the owner was busing dishes in his suit coat. 

This same person (I wish I could have caught his name) noticed we had no been attended to and took our order himself. I was excited. I hail from California originally and was looking forward to some upscale mexican. We ordered quite a few items from the appetizers/starters/tapas (not exactly sure what they are trying to get at with them) and then waited and waited and waited some more. Again, the owner brought us our food and drinks and it looked amazing. 

That's about all the nice things I have to say. The tostones rellenos (ropa viejas and shrimp) had literally no flavor. None. I mean, zip, zero. I had to complain. It was next to inedible. The owner came over and reassured us that this was an off night and took it away and removed them from our bill.  We got the calamari/shrimp, taquitos (which are actually mini tacos), and the empanada trio. The owner also brought out three kinds of salsas saying that one was hot, one medium, and one mild and describing the ingredients. 

I'm not a major heat fiend. I like spicy but I also like to not feel sick because it's so spicy. However, the salsas were (again) flavorless. Instead of mild, medium, and hot, they should have been described as pathetic, meh, and mild. The rest of the food was edible, but no better than the On The Border chain. Which is sad, ya'll. 

I wish it could have been good. I promise. But it wasn't.",0.0
"Local is one of our regular spots. Nice pours, friendly staff, usually nice clientele. It has the nicest interior decoration on Bell and it is the newest. 

What I really don't like is the music, just like everywhere else on Bell. Why not play some tunes that will go along with the design of your place? Bell boulevard has an old taste in music, if not bad. Play something different than other bars around the corner. People are sick of 'This is how we do it' and 'Journey'. Put some Deep/Progressive House, some cool beats and it will be one of a kind spot on Bell. 

Just like paying the most attention to the taste at a restaurant, music is the second more important thing after drinks at a bar.",0.0
"Does anybody remember that ridiculous show Sweet Genius? How about the episode where there was that guy that made a key lime pie with jelly beans and hot sauce and got his ass handed to him by the crazy host?

As obscure as all that sounds, I still remember it because it was hilarious, and now that same guy has opened a branch of his pie shop in Soho. He clearly doesn't mention any ties to that show, since he was booted in the first round, but he does advertise how he was a contestant on another TV show, ABC's Shark Tank.

I'm always up to try some pie at a new place, so we came into this really large space with tons of seats and nobody sitting in them. It took awhile to get the attention of the sole person in the place, the woman running the counter that was super sick of life. I was disappointed to see that all they had were large whole pies for sale, or mini pies, which were shrink-wrapped and prepackaged ($4 for a 3 inch slice). They had the standard flavors you would expect, such as Pumpkin, Pecan, Chocolate Pecan and a few others I don't remember because the kind woman rattled them off quickly without looking at me.

The Chocolate Pecan Pie was ok, but was hard to differentiate from a standard grocery store pie, and was probably too pricey for what it was. Also too pricey was the slice of Double Chocolate Cake we tried, also prepackaged in stacks of plastic containers on the counter. I don't know if it's just me, but it makes such a huge difference to actually watch them cut you out a nice slice from a whole cake rather than seeing them all just sitting there already sliced for who knows how long. At a whopping $7.50, I couldn't tell if this was the same as or better than a Costco sheet cake (that's kind of a compliment, but not really).

Everything about this place just reeked of laziness. They serve food too, as I noticed a few signs touting his famous Chicken & Waffles, as well as gelato, but as far as pie and dessert is concerned, I don't see Mr. Tod staying alive here for long.",0.0
Perfect way to end the evening. Cupcakes and wine. I took my bestie on a date. Too bad we were sick so we couldn't drink alcohol.  We still indulged in cupcakes. Wish the place was a little more organized. Place was packed with tables about 2 feet from the door.   There really isn't a hostess. there was this large group of six waiting for a table ahead of us. Luckily they decided to leave. The next table became available soon after. I will definitely have my next date take me here hehehe,0.0
"this place reminds me of a cracker barrel -only with more hipsters and dim lighting. 

like cracker barrel - think of gigantic portions, tons and tons of butter, fluffy biscuits and some good ol fried chicken. 

the dranks are so good here- get the strawberry jam (strawberry infused gin and lemonade)- so good it doesn't even taste like you're drinking alcohol. The BLT bloody mary is also great- spicy and strong topped with a delicious jalapeno bacon. 


I ordered the mushroom gravy smotherd chicken biscuit- Lawd have mercy- I feel like Paula Deen made this for me-- So... Much... Butter! But dam that chicken is crispy, the biscuit is so buttery, and the sauce is BOSS.

My BF ordered the Chicken and Pancakes- his dish was good but mine was better! The pancakes are waaayy to dense and I felt like I could only take a few bites before getting sick of it. 

In addition, we also ordered the fried pickles- the contrast of the sour pickles and salty batter was amazing, and the Mac n cheese- pretty tasty. Although ordering these appetizers were a huge mistake, because  the portions were so big and filling, we couldn't finish our entrees. 

Also- they don't take reservations for groups smaller than like 4. So come early, put your number down, go to the bar across the street to have a drink, and come back in time to enjoy some comfort food.",0.0
"Just like all chain stores you hope to find that one that may be different. Nope it is mos def not this one. 
Dont bother looking at the sale price--98% of the time its wrong. The other 2% is because the store is so disorganized that things usually not where they are supposed to be.
Parking? Oh goodness. Leave your car at home and just walk. It is such a mess and there is always that douche bag that either takes up 2 spots or the prick that doesnt know how to back out of a space and is willing and able to bump your car just to get out.

"Like a hybrid of a Whole Foods, a Trader Joe's, & a big supermarket.

Good: 
1- Wide Selection & includes both cheap (e.g. Salmon) & pricey Caviar, Tripe, Bone Marrow, & good smelly cheeses.
2-Some specialty items like various Jamons. Like the $199 a pound Iberico Jamon, which price reflects the unique porkers in Spain who only eat acorns.  Does it taste better & more tender than others...yep! But it is a pricey luxury which is generally almost impossible to find in most of California....nor was I aware of it back in early NYC years.
3-Good selection of various veges & fruits, but you can tell they were picked unripened, & then artificially ripened (e.g. Ethylene Oxide ?)
4-Bread are diverse & have a nice crunch...but they seem to run out of Rye Bread too easily.

Bad:
1- Nowhere as good selection nor freshness as in many coastal California stores, especially since they are either grown there, or in nearby Mexico.
2- Does not come anywhere near most of the fresh Farmer's Markets in CA & elsewhere.
3- Staff in general seems underpaid & not too knowledgable.
4-Like a big box store, but big prices.
5- Cheese selection is not diverse enough.

In summary, after being spoiled by California fresh food, this place underwhelms me, but I imagine it is great for local denizens...especially after they paid their mortgage on million dollar apartments.

Fairway also came in handy for my NYC visit, since it was between NYU Medical Center (where I was a health care proxy for my very sick mom) & the Hyatt Herald Square (my room had a small frig for snacks).",0.0

"My husband and I absolutely love Guacuco on Irving so when we were trying to figure out a great place to hold our wedding rehearsal dinner, we called up the manager.  For the size of group we had, he recommended we book out Guacuco Hotdog on Starr street instead and noted that we'd get the same menu of Arepas and Empanadas that you'd get at the one on Irving - which is exactly what we wanted!  

Everything went great - we had the entire restaurant to ourselves for our friends and family.  They all enjoyed the food and Leonardo must have gotten sick of all of the Cocada shake orders, but my family loved them so much.  

Service started a little slow (I presume because it was just one person and about 30 of us!), but we were all having a good time and were happy. Once we got our food, we were all busy chowing down and drinking.  

I'm glad that we decided to have our party here, and I know my family from out of town will not find something like this back home! It was great to give them this experience!",0.0

"I'm so surprised at the number of low ratings on this venue!  Webster Hall is located in the NYU area and it's in a historical building that's been around since 1886 (!). They have a crazy line-up of artists and performers that come, sometimes surprise guests, and have 5 sections to get your party on (the Grand Ballroom, the Marlin Room, the Studio, the Balcony Lounge, and the Sports Bar).  I came here to be a total fangirl and actually stood in line for 9 hours (because I'm crazy like that and wanted to be the first in line).  The bouncers were all professional and straightforward (Dean was AWESOME!), and they kept the lines orderly and safe.  They start giving out bracelets earlier to those who are 21 and over, or who are 19-20.  Checking in with the tickets was fairly a quick process, and security checkpoint was a little hardcore.  Once you get patted down, you are free to roam around the different floors.  I just wished they had better signs directing you on where you should be going, as I just assumed the Grand Ballroom the first area you arrive at :P (I did get to see DJ Sean Sharp, though, and he was pretty darn good!).  Either way, I did end up where I was supposed to be, and all I can say is that it was literally one of the best concerts I've been to (of course, depending on who you came to see!).  It was all about the SICK sound system - it was RIDICULOUS.  If you have a DJ/group that knows what mixes/beats to play, it gets pretty crazy - the bass literally has all your organs vibrate - OH EM GEE, no joke!  I was super duper impressed!!!  Some may complain that it's too loud (I saw some people covering their earholes), but I absolutely LOVED it. The crowd was pretty okay (you have your typical rude pushers, but stand your ground!), but overall, the crowd was manageable and controlled.  The whole experience was just crazy as I was able to meet/touch/hug/obtain autographs/take pictures with the group I came to see when they arrived (literally outside by the entrance - yes, I almost DIED)!

"Most important: the ramen is sick, including the vegetarian ramen, which is on my top 10 for sure. But I've been with enough non-vegetarians to know that ALL the ramen here is sick. So definitely go! 

But the experience -- it's not a totally relaxed low-key kind of ramen shop. It's so popular and small that there's often a line, and almost always a wait, even on weekday evenings. They use an app (you can download it) where you can see where you are on the list and guess how much longer your wait will be, and there are plenty of nice bars right there (Weather Up is right across the street) so it's not the worst place to be waiting. Just know you're going to be. 

Once you're seated, you might have that crowded New York restaurant feeling where you feel a little too stressed out by all the people waiting for tables to remember to breathe while you're eating. And you might be seated really close to strangers. But hopefully you're used to that by now. So... even though the ramen is amazing it's not usually my top choice. But it's definitely worth making the effort now and then.

The service is always lovely. They give great recommendations and don't up-sell you or anything like that.

"I've been in this place and my 4 star rating reflects this. However, I'd ignore all recent 1 star ratings made by radical man hating feminists because it's simply harassment instigated by Dobkin who runs the femtard blog called Gothamist. These females are sick and the rating does not reflect the quality of this establishment and they use Yelp to defame businesses and individuals that do not fit into their warped agenda.
If you permit this sort of harassment and disinformation to continue, Yelp will become virtually worthless as a rating service that people look to for an opinion. You're going to have to set your filters so that when a business that is receiving normal ratings suddenly is inundated with 1's that all of the recent 1's are removed otherwise your site is useless.
Not 1 of these ridiculous females, including those posing as men, has said anything about the business but have just repeated some trivial unfounded allegation made by a mentally unstable female.One of these female 'reviewers' has even admitted she has never been in this place lol The female detectives reviewed the video and blood test for drugs and found nothing.

It drives me nuts when I make eye contact with an employee standing around doing nothing, and they look away as if they can't help me. You don't deserve your job!!!! The food is a whole different story. Breakfast here is pretty good. Pretty hard to f@*k up a waffle or omelet or eggs IMHO. What bothered me most of all was a burger I ordered.

"How does this place even have a star, let alone 3.5? Maybe because of the mediocre food being a shocker to find on 2nd Ave? You need Stephen Hawkin to answer that one. How do I start this, adventure for lack of a better word. So I get there 5 minutes after my girlfriend and her friend, when I arrived they already ordered a coffee and cappuccino. When I sit they inform me none of this has come yet. So I call over the waitress, she apologizes and takes our full order. We ordered eggs Benedict (with roasted potatoes, and btw those weren'te EB), iced coffee, Bloody Mary, french toast, and the coffee and cap again. About 10 minutes later the Bloody Mary and Cap come out, no coffee and no iced coffee. So we ask the guy who either doesn't know English or was too stoned to speak and understand the language where our coffee and iced coffees were. After saying Iced coffee five times he said okay and left. 10 minutes later the coffee comes out, not the iced one. So we call our waitress over, say where's the iced coffee she said sorry be right back. Well out comes our food, still no iced coffee in case you were at the edge of your seats wondering. Oh and no ROASTED POTATOES. Finally, I ask the other waitress where both are, she brings my iced coffee but not the potatoes. So I followed in pursuit and asked the original waitress where the heck my potatoes were. Btw this is after we told her our friend had a train. Anyway the food was mediocre at best, but the service was so bad it was comical. In all seriousness I don't know if they were too high to their job, too stupid, or just bad at it, but the fact I gave an 18% tip makes me sick to this day.

Every time I eat there I leave with a smile on my face and a happy food baby in my belly.  This food makes me feel so good after I eat it and  never once sick or tired. They make everything to order right in front of you. Every sauce is hand made, every kernel of corn is hand cut off the cob. They even make their own drinks (HOMEMADE jARRITOS! ) and their own desserts. Chipotle has NOTHING on What a Taco!!

"DISGUSTING SERVICE. Stay away from this place if you are smart. There is a young man working here named Erin, a lighter skinned Hispanic young male who will attempt to poison your food if you disagree with him. 

We went in with a few questions about one if the sauces on the menu and as we were trying to explain our point he became very belligerent and argumentative. I tried to call the manager over, whose name is Susana, to ask her about the dish and the Erin guy was so intimidating ( literally standing near her from behind so he could hear, and with a threatening demeanor)  that i couldn't even ask her, out of fear of his retaliation, and I ended up ordering the salmon dish. The dish wasn't too bad but it really wasn't what I wanted as this place has different types of pasta that I really wanted to try. Then, as the manager walked away and was out of sight, he walks in the middle of the restaurant to this other young male with long braids to his shoulder (also Hispanic/Latino) laughing and pointing at our table in a not so subtle manner.  My guest was over the age of 60 which was beyond inappropriate. When the food arrived a young pretty woman, somewhat short and Caucasian with curly hair had the food and gave it to Erin to bring over, as it was his table. He was only a few steps from our table but attempted to sneak our dinners back to where the bathroom area was. I nearly panicked with a heart attack until that same nice woman audibly asked him not to take the dinners away to a strange place in the back. Why would someone attempt to sneak your dish away near the toilet? This Erin guy is bad news and I am advising anyone who appreciates good restaurant service, appropriate behavior, and a respectful experience to stay away from this restaurant. The Owner Susanna should view this young man as a serious liability. Good luck in not getting sick if this Erin guy is your waiter.",0.0
"The experience I had at Harry's was one I would like to forget. First, I was told I could not partake in the unlimited brunch and order a meal from the menu, which was not true. Second, I arrived with a fresh Starbucks coffee and without even informing me outside beverages were not allowed, the bus boy threw it away without my knowledge. It was not until I asked where my coffee had gone that I was informed that the bus boy had disposed of it. But it did not end there. The service was AWFUL and the waiter was slow and rude. He even swore as he walked away from our table after my vegetarian frittata came out and I asked (after taking a couple bites) if there was cheese in the meal. I was informed that there was not but when I told him I was vegan and lactose intolerant, he informed me that he would make sure by asking the chef. There was in fact cheese in the frittata and he rudely told me that I did not ask for no cheese. But why would one ask for no cheese if the menu did not include the ingredient in the description of the item? I am now sick and have not felt well since the meal. Not one item was comped and no apologies were given. I would recommend to STAY AWAY from this establishment. I will NEVER go back.",0.0
"I don't know whether to give this place 1 star or five. I love the food -- the croissants are great, the ham & gruyere sandwich on baguette is amazing and most of the employees are super nice. That all makes for a 5 star review. But one employee there really just ruins everything. Her attitude is so bad, it makes me never want to go back -- and I used to go multiple times a week, sometimes even twice a day. The first few times I went in, I had such a wonderful experience with great customer service and super cool employees -- they even made me fresh baguettes once when they were out. Then, whenever they weren't there and the other girl was, the whole ambiance in the place was different. Her bad attitude just radiates from behind the counter. She yelled at my boyfriend once for asking for extra jelly; One time I asked her for extra jelly, and because she didn't respond at all (which people usually do when they hear you), I thought she didn't hear me. So, I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't know if you heard me, can you throw in an extra jelly, please?"" She snapped back, ""I heard you, OK?"" and threw the jelly in the bag. I hear her constantly snapping at customers -- to an old lady with thick glasses and obviously poor eyesight/hearing, when she asked what type of croissant an item was: ""It's NOT a croissant, it's a cookie,"" super aggressively. Today, however, takes the cake. So I went in this morning and got a bunch of croissants, she was there and was rude, but whatever, right? Their croissants are good. My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go back to get the ham sandwich for a late lunch. We walked in, noticed it was her again and prepared for some attitude as usual. When we ordered the sandwiches she said, ""Um. Ok. But our oven is off so it won't be hot."" I didn't understand. ""Our oven is off because its a waste of energy. So your sandwich will be cold."" I still didn't really understand. ""We aren't using the oven very much and its a waste of energy so I turned it off and I'm not turning it back on."" I still don't really understand this but... apparently she's too busy saving the environment to make my sandwich? Needless to say, we left and went down the street to Tompkins Square Bagels, where they are still willing to toast sandwiches. To be clear, this isn't me being picky and wanting a toasted sandwich for no reason. It says toasted on the menu, and it's supposed to be served hot. Served cold kinda defeats the whole purpose. From now on, I'm gonna look through the window and if I see her working, steer clear. If I were the owner, I would be PISSED if I found out my employee not only had a horrible attitude but would rather save me a few bucks on the electricity bill than make money serving customers. Let's be real -- she probably doesn't give a shit about the environment, and definitely doesn't care about her boss' electricity bill. She just can't be bothered to help customers and didn't want to do ANY work today. She should've just called in sick. That way, she wouldn't have to work and wouldn't scare away loyal customers.

If I were the owner, I would REALLY pay attention to these yelp reviews. Almost every review here is super positive, regarding the food, at least. Every single negative review is because of the staff and the customer service, or lack thereof.",0.0
"I went here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Thursday around 9pm. We showed up without a reservation and it was an hour wait. So if you want to go, you should make a reservation.

I'm first going to start off by saying that I was a bit skeptical of the popular ""chicken and waffles"", but heard it was great, so we went and tried it anyway.

I ultimately wouldn't come back here. We both felt like we were punched in the stomach after our meal. I'm usually a bit sensitive to eats heavy foods, but my boyfriend can eat anything and feel great. So that's definitely saying something about the food here that even he felt sick.

RESTAURANT OVERVIEW:
-Small amount of seating outside on the sidewalk when it's warm (where we sat)
-Small, quaint restaurant with a rustic feel
-Casual/trendy/hipster vibe

APPS:
-1 Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits: These are good, very buttery; However they only give you two little squares! A bit pricey for what they give you.
-1 Macaroni & Cheese: This came in a small dish with thick pieces of cheesy macaroni baked with crumbled bread on top. This was good - not the best mac and cheese I've had, but it was good (it's hard for me NOT to like mac and cheese, like c'mon). It was a bit heavy though. For the amount of food we ate at this point, we were definitely filling up more than usual, so the ingredients must be VERY heavy (probably aided to my stomachache). 

DINNER:
-We each got a Chicken & Waffles: Not a fan. I had heard so much hype about this, and it was definitely a let down. Maybe it's just personal preference on taste. But I realize that I prefer my waffles with some maple syrup. The sandwich comes in two halves. Waffle on the bottom (apparently it is cooked with maple syrup, but I didn't taste any syrup - just a plain very doughy waffle), layered with a pickled green tomato, the fried chicken, melted cheddar cheese on top of that, and then pickles. This was really hard to eat and the combo just did not taste right to me. The waffle itself - I've had much better. It was much too doughy for me. The fried chicken was VERY fried. It was many layers deep of fried bread before the chicken. Right after we were done I had the WORST stomachache I've had in years. I never get stomachaches! It felt like I was just punched in the gut. It was horrible. I could hardly walk home! Michael felt the same way.

DRINKS:
-Lady J Ivory: this was suggested to me after I told the waitress what my preferences are (I really like whiskey, old fashioneds, citrus tasting drinks, fresh ingredients). I didn't love it. It had a strange creamy taste.

SERVICE:
-Our waitress had a thick Russian accent, so she was a bit hard to understand.

PRICE:
-It was definitely pricey for the amount of food you get, but also for the actual food you get. I don't mind going somewhere pricey with small plates if the food is great, but when it isn't that great AND makes you feel like you just got punched, it is not worth it!

Overall, I would not recommend this place.",0.0
"I was kinda on the fence with this place considering the mixed bag of reviews. However, i am very very happy we came here!

Came in with my boyfriend, good friend and her boyfriend for a double date/quiet birthday dinner. We ordered up a storm of food and drinks and had only two complaints:
First: why doesnt that amazing donut plate come with a second donut? 
Second: there was one bourbon drink we werent thrilled over. It was a cocktail mixed with the aforementioned bourbon, with mint syrup and some other sweet thing. My boyfriend wasnt a fan. 

However, the rest of the gang loved the other cocktails! 

The atmosphere is absolutely adorable and hitching on the cabin-y, rustic, farmish trend where the walls are made of unstained wood, there are hanging bowls of succulents, and a few short shelves here and there of strange books ï¼ˆone discovered to be published from our beloved US naval academy... navel? Naw, navalï¼‰

I didnt see anything mentioned on the menu if this was a farm to table joint, as the decor seems to suggest. If it were, then it could justify the prices a bit more. The waitress didnt volunteer the information, and i regrettably didnt ask. I am a huge supporter of local organic and food justice farms, and would hate to see the decor used as a gimmick rather than a statement. 

If you do come, i cannot gush over that crack sick ass amazing donut they serve enough. Im usually not a fan of mixing savory with sweet, but will more than eagerly make an exception for that beyond delightful donut. Calories? Diet? pssssh! Who freakin cares?! I NEED THAT DONUT!

We also enjoyed the deviled eggs and broccoli. I make a mean deviled eggs myself, but I'll gladly say hats off to thier beautiful rendition. It tastes pretty damn good... its gotta have bacon or some other natural crack ingredient in it. Its smokey and creamy... the broccoli was equally good. My girlfriend ended up getting that as her entree, as it was so damned good. 

Boyfriend got the stuffed chicken and i ordered the duck breast. Friend's boyfriend got the pasta. The duck was.... fracking good. Juicy, tender, crispy, and cooked to perfection. The chicken was also ridiculously delicious. Now as an Asian American, i will typically turn up my nose at chicken dry ass white meat breast, but this stuffed chicken breast was juicy and incredibly full of flavor. 

The wine list was very decent. We ended up getting a bottle of tempranillo, one of my favorite wines. Im glad they even serve it!

Good wine with good food, all with great company! What more can a birthday girl ask for? 

Oh, and i really enjoy the attention to detail here. They offer table flat and sparkling water. Yessss! Service was on point without geing overbearing. And.... clean bathrooms. Thank you! Its a one stop shop of, why yes! This is lovely!

Oh, and upon writing this review i realize i have another complaint:
Third: there arent enough vegetarian options. The menu was pretty much all meat centric!

Did i mention, get the donut?",0.0
"Unfortunately our service here lowered what otherwise would have been a 4 or 5 star experience for me and my party. We came here for a friend's birthday in a party of 9 (he had made a reservation). I completely understand that we were a large group, but the restaurant was not crowded and still our server made a fuss about seating all of us and took a long time getting us water and taking our orders.

The food was amazing - I would give it five stars hands down. I ordered the biscuit with the chicken tenders, spicy mayo, and pickles. An AMAZING sandwich: the biscuit was buttery and flaky, soft and absorbent for all that spicy mayo and the briny pickles. The fried crust on the chicken was so delicious. And generous portions! Two very large sandwiches for one order. I could have easily (and happily!) eaten both of them, but not wanting to make myself sick, I gave one of the sandwiches to a friend. I sampled the chorizo fresca and the foie gras, which was some of the best I've had. Everyone else was very happy with their brunch items as well. And the cocktails are boozy, so no complaints in the food or drinks departments.

We were just all rubbed the wrong way by our server. Yes, we were a large group. Yes, we perhaps stupidly asked to split the check 9 ways.  And we understood that it was a fire hazard to put a chair at the end of the table for the 9th person, so we had to squeeze on the benches. And yes we understood it was inconvenient to ask to split the check 9 ways, and we truthfully weren't even expecting that we might be able to - we just wanted to ask. But our server was just rude. We had to ask several times for water refills. She was visibly frustrated and even a bit rude at the end. Even though we were a large party, we weren't rowdy, rude or in any way different from the other diners, yet we weren't treated well, enough that our collective thoughts on the restaurant upon leaving were ""Ugh, just get me out of here."" Food is good though.",0.0
"I went in the this establishment not expecting much. Found myself not wanting to leave. 

Ambience wise, its a very small space crowded with sitting stools. You end up either bumping into a fellow customer or a sitting arrangement. Definitely not a sit down place. But well lighted. 

Food wise. Now here is where things get wild. :)  Food is off the hook !!! 
ordered the 
PEANUT MASALA .... awesome!
CHICKEN ROLL.........awesome!
Paneer Roll ...............awesome!

Service was pretty good too, If you're new to the Indian street food the cook can make some nice suggestions for you.

my girl friend .... was having a foodgasim if that is a real world  
Prices are super cheap so you can keep ordering the rest of the menu. I think next time  I'm going to try the 
JAAL MOORI and BHEL PURI  

So if you want to experience street food of Calcutta, or India in general this is the place to go to. Its cheap and the food is great. 
Also the cooks use Olive oil instead of some cheap oils, so you definitely cant get sick from the food here. 

This is definitely our go to place for some quick street food from now on.",0.0
"The food was pretty good . The Mac and cheese was great . It is one of the better ones I've had in the city. We got it with bacon.
      I would've given 4 for food but the service wasn't so great . There were reserved tables. We asked if we could sit in them.  They told us no. No one sat in them the entire time we were there from start to finish . It was pretty annoying. 
      Then the food took up our teeny tiny table to the point that we had to get our fries to go because there was no where to fit them . It was pretty ridiculous . They didn't take the cover off my mussels and it was piping hot .  We had to do it ourselves. Then there was barely any room for that , which turned into the shell dish . I kept trying to get the waitress's attention. Then, no spoon for the mussel broth and no waitress in sight so I had my hubby get me a spoon.  Then about 10 min later I asked the girl to wrap up my mussels and she told me that if I ate them later I would prob get sick. I told her I wanted them wrapped anyway. I just  think she didn't feel like wrapping them up . I make mussels all the time and eat them the next day.",0.0
"Thought I would give this place a try after reading good reviews about their Jackson Heights location. Glad I tried it but I will definitely not be returning. Ate there on a warm spring evening. The doors were open but we decided to eat indoors because it was windy outside. It was very warm inside. They should have had the AC on but they did not. We ordered the coconut mojito and it just didn't taste right. 

Our meals took about 20 minutes to arrive. If you crave salt, this is the place for you. We ordered the arroz con pollo and steak fajitas. Both dishes were loaded with salt. The meat was chewy and didn't seem fresh. Although it didn't make us sick, we were up half the night either drinking water or going to the bathroom to get rid of the water from all the salt. 

Service was spotty. Took a while to get our order taken, have our glasses filled and get the check.

In conclusion, despite the long wait at peak times, I would eat at 5 Burro any day over this place when craving Mexican in Forest Hills and would not recommend this place to anyone unless they have a serious craving for very salty food.",0.0
"TL;DR Even my 3 year old niece who once ate my mom's spaghetti (not good) thought Mille Crepe tasted like poop and looked like a vegetarian diarrhea.

I'm not sure if its jsut my family, but growing up whenever there was a birthday we had Carvel Ice cream cake.  For 20 years that was the routine...so it got boring and the first time my brother got the chance to buy a bday cake cause he now had income, well it started a new tradition of mad fancy bourgeois cakes.  I'm talkin momofuku, dominique ansel type sh!t.  I for one was very happy with this new tradition....until this piece of garbage fruit platter.

So my brother bought the Mille Crepe cake for his daughter's 3rd birthday for us all to enjoy.  He researched the place and wanted the ""mango cake"" but they sold out and just went for the one that was teh most popular.

As we opened the box it looked alright, then we started cutting the slices.  We were all a little shocked at the simpleness of crepe, cream, and fruits.  And to none of our surprise...it tasted like poop.  I'm talking worst than those chinatown bakery fruit cakes.  It looked and tasted disgusting.  It looked so bad the birthday girl didn't even want any.  She looked pretty upset but didnt say anything (it's that asian culture upbringing you see taking hold--hold your tongue).  We forced her to have a bite and she just plain out said ""yucky!"" and made that cute smile that accompanies it as a cover to make it seem ok to complain.  She didn't have anymore.

Now...I wasn't as angry as I am now about the cake.  What tipped me to full blown I wish Yelp made negative stars as a rating was it's price.  I didn't pay for it but daaam...i don't like when someone cons my family.  ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS plust effing tax for this piece of crap.  

Let me break this down for you--it's made of the following:
-Crepe slices
-Cream
-Fruits

....does that sound like $100 to you? I don't care if you pay your workers $15 an hour, this cake costs $20 tops. Dude you know what $100 can get you?  Let me break that down for you too:
-2 1/2 cakes (serves 8-12/cake) from momofuku or 1 bigger cake (serves 20-30)  
-20 cronuts from Dominique Ansel
-around 80 donuts from the Donut Pub
-Steak for 2 at Peter Luger's
-400 dumplings at Prosperity
-5 Carvel ice cream cakes
You get the point.

Why are people giving this fruit eater vomit good reviews?  I have no idea...well i sorta do but it's just too mean (it goes along the lines of people are sheep and can't think for themselves and base quality and value on price instead of their own actual feelings).  Do people like cream and fruits that much?  I swear if someone comes back at me saying well it's in house made cream and its fresh fruits....dude steakhouses make inhouse cream called shclag and they just top that stuff off for free, and where the hell do you live that you can't get fresh fruits?  

It's places like this that furthers the OG immigrant moms out there premise of slapping you in the back of the head for buying something while growing up because you just getting conned and you should just let her make everything.  This is why I didn't have a real birthday cake cake till i was probably 22.  Man eff Carvel Ice-cream cakes and eff Mille Crepes.

Ok...i just looked at the side and found out this place originates from Japan....I'm definitely not telling my mom that cause she not over WWII yet....and should we be?  Now I gotta watch my naruto episodes with my headphones so she can't tell i'm listening ot japanese.",0.0
"Been going to Georgia Diner for over 10 years and always loved the food and service. Unfortunately last month I went back with my family and had a horrible experience ever. Ordered a turkey burger and it looked like a piece of rubber, it was dry, hard and disgusting. My sister ordered eggplant parm stale and watered down, and my mother had chicken parm which tasted frozen and wasn't even heated enough. We decided to order coffee at the end to try to make up for the horrible dinner, but the coffee tasted like it was two days old. Thought I was goin to be sick after this meal. Afterwards we spoke with the manager, and told him how we have been loyal customers for years and were unhappy. He had a nasty attitude, was least bothered and rushed us out the diner. Never coming back here again, absolutely the worst diner! The service is excellent, but the food sucks! Even thought this place is 24 hours, save your money and go somewhere else!

"Only 70 reviews, more people have to be in the know. This is one of my favorite places for lunch, they deliver and very quick. My personal/work inbox gets some love from Anna Romani every day with the specials and menu.

They have a LOT of variety as they do plenty of catering, so I can only speak to what I've tried here.

The best value here is the large platter. $13.00 and a choice of three of the specials, there are usually six to seven each day. The platters are pretty big. The tuna tartar is excellent, when t hey have it. It's not overpowered with all the additives, you really get to enjoy the taste of the fish.The lobster and calamari salad is excellent as well.

Look out for the Baked Tagliolini. This is great if you want to veg out for the rest of the work day. Get the large and ask for all three choices to be the pasta. It's a wonderful concoction of pasta, cheese and shredded ham. The lasagna bolognese is rare to come across but if they have it, GET IT. Sick. If lady M made a lasagna flavored cake, this is what it would taste like. 

If you're looking to cater something for a corporate event, this will definitely get your clients talking about the food. Hopefully you're getting reimbursed or swiping it on a corporate card.",0.0
"Adorable cafe with tasty sandwiches.  I know Yelp labeled it as a burgers place, but it doesn't have that vibe.. it's more emphasis on the sandwiches I believe. I was surprised to find this in this area.  Came after spending some time at the cloisters, so it was a pleasant day!  The waitress was super attentive and helpful.  We gave her such a big tip because she deserved it.. perhaps even more than we gave! Shout out to her!  It got really busy around lunch time and she still kept her cool.  The place is tiny, so be aware that you will be a bit cramped.  We sat right in front of the door, so you could barely let the door open. 

They had interesting sandwich options.  We ordered the Gourmet Chimi: Your choice of ground sirloin or chicken breast, topped with tomato slices, shredded cabbage, onions, chipotle sauce, mayo, mustard, and ketchup. Served with your choice of seasoned fried potatoes, Yuca Fries, or salad for $10 and the Moroccan Chicken Chicken breast, curry, raisins, mayo, Roma tomatoes, and baby greens on whole wheat bread for $9.  

I actually liked the Gourmet Chimi more than the Moroccan Chicken.  I think there is a part in me that doesn't like the temperature of cold curry on bread.  Curry needs to be HOT to be tasty!  Next time I will keep that in mind, so I don't order curry on sandwiches again.  The Gourmet Chimi had a real punch of flavor, but I would suggest it with chicken rather than sirloin.  The YUCCA fries everyone is talking about tastes like those fried dimsum taro dumplings ... I think if you are familiar with dimsum, you all know what I'm talking about.  Once I realized it tasted like those, I had to stop eating so many of them.  They're good if you're having a few.  I got kinda sick of the flavor after a while...  not saying you shouldn't try it, but I still prefer the good old regular potato fries.",0.0
"Wow! I wish I read these reviews before trying to use this location to fill my prescription!  The reviews about mis-informed teenagers helping people with prescriptions is so true! Staff is rude and disorganized and they like to blame customers for any errors. If I could, this spot would get half a star, just for being open for business.

Last month, a girl told me my doctor only prescribed 3 refills (which is untrue) and today a girl told me my doctor only prescribed 5.... Where are these people getting their inconsistent numbers from? My doctor always prescribes 6 refills, ALWAYS! so I got annoyed to the point that I asked to speak to the supervisor, the pharmacist. I was trying to explain my situation and he kept cutting me off, I asked him to stop cutting me off bc it's unprofessional and he got very defensive and short. He put me on hold, fixed the situation (apparently they needed to transfer my medication from another location which was closer to work that I used to use.... Which is in no way my fault, so I don't know why they are upset as if I gave them wrong information, which the pharmacist told me.) I told this location the first time when I came that I wanted to transfer stores bc this one is closer to My home now, and I got my prescription that day so I assumed all was well. It's not our fault that they are disorganized..
   So, I don't know if this pharmacist was having a bad day, or of he is always passive aggressive and rude... but I tried to explain to him how I'm sure they deal with elderly and sick people on the regular, and asked him to put himself in a sick or elderly persons shoes ; getting inconsistent information from the cashiers could easily drive a healthy person up a wall, let alone a sick or old one... And I realized that homeboy hung up on me! He's in for a treat when I show up later today to pick up my medication and ask to speak to the general manager. I'll mention all of these accurate Yelp reviews and tell him that due to such consistent lack of care and respect, this location is losing me as a customer. If the manager decides to be rude (which based on reviews is likely to happen) I will immediately ask him how i can contact the regional manager (basically, whoever is their direct boss) and take my issue higher up the chain because as I can see, this is a recurring issue! 
   I live a 5 minute walk from this store location, but its more pleasant for me to trek over to the Rite Aid in LES, Manhattan instead. I would rather spend an extra $5 in transportation and 1 hour of my time than come back to this ratchet store.

"Unfortunately, I was feeling pretty sick the day we came here for dinner so I had to play it safe with my food choices. I went for the chicken soup and the ceasar salad even though I would have loved to have tried some salmon kebabs.

I'm a firm believer that you can tell a lot about a restaurant from the quality of their more basic options and this was proved true with Deniz. The soup and salad were both great. The soup was thick in texture (but somehow had a lighter watery appearance) and the red bell peppers added extra flavour to the chicken, which was plentiful. The salad was a huge portion and the lettuce was crispy and fresh. There was a bit too much ceasar sauce for my liking but it wasn't too much of an issue as the sauce was light and not super-strong to taste.

My boyfriend had the chicken sautee and loved it. I sampled a small bit and it was truly delicious with an amazing combination of flavours. The chicken was of very good quality.

Prices were great and I'd recommend the general area of non-touristy downtown Brooklyn for anyone wanting to experience a true New York community. There are lots of excellent restaurants here that are literally half the price of their Manhattan competitors.

"I would always come into this Dunkin Donuts, and I thought, ""Whatever... It's Dunkin Donuts..."" I have been in so many Dunkin Donuts across the city, that it should be similar... You get me!? LOL.

So I was happy on this day because I was going to grab breakfast with my boyfriend and actually sit inside, have a nice convo over some iced coffees and bagels :). We ordered our iced coffees, and the lady came back with iced coffees and no whip cream. Who doesnt want whip cream on their iced coffee!? So I told her, and she went back... She added whip cream on both, and each had just one drop of carame, LITERALLYl! SMH, SMH... The food was whatever, but the location? The location is a problem.

We saw this one lady receive her coffee... and I guess it was too full? The lady had an attitude, and started pouring some of it out on the floor!!! Then, she just walked away as if she was above the world. The coffee stayed on the floor till we left... Who knows if they even cleaned it... and when they cleaned it! 

OOH... They have flys everywhere, so I would not recommend eating the donuts. 

What made this experience THE WORST EVER is the following-- there was an older gentleman in there, sitting not doing anything... taking up seats that ACTUAL customers could be using... We sat kind of close to him, so that we would not be in the way of the line. As we were speaking, he leaned to the left and threw the biggest fart in the worldddd... It was very disgusting, and it made us nauseous; even thinking about it now is making me feel sick!

"Wasn't busy at all on the Monday I came in, but they told us it normally was, they just weren't having bands play that night because the host was sick. Had a great time though. The staff was super friendly, like some of the friendliest staff I've met. The drinks were good and cheap (advertise that they have happy hour all day). They have a big patio outside in the back with lots of seating. It's more a dive bar that has bands some nights, so I was surprised to see how extensive their menu was. The loaded fries were definitely good.  Good place to come for drinks and partying as well as dinner.",0.0
"I had my doubts over their all you can eat sushi deal. 48 hours later I'm still alive and no trips to the bathroom so that's a good sign. They weren't busy and we received our orders fairly quick. Rolls weren't overloaded with rice as others have said but after eating so many rolls I was definitely sick of rice. Not surprisingly every roll tasted the same, but that's what happens when most of them have some combination of spicy tuna, eel sauce, spicy mayo, crunch or tempura. I feel these American sushi joints are like Taco Bell, no matter what creation of theirs you eat it all just starts to taste the same. $26 groupon with 3 drinks is the way to go and is a phenomenal value. If your goal is to get wasted go for sake, ounce for ounce the best alcohol value. The $44 regular price is all you can drink so if your goal is to get sh@t faced drunk and you're still young enough where you can stomach 6+ drinks the go for it.

The place just opened, so it seems to still be very slow, but hopefully it will catch on with spring and summer coming because they have yummy yogurts, yummy drinks (coffee, tea, sodas, etc.) and a great space. The space has a positive vibe but doesn't feel very relaxing, maybe because of the simplicity and the high ceilings... I think they just need more customers to fill up the space, or some green plants?? Wishing this place success, and hoping that they will keep their customer service high during busy times too.",0.0
"Only tried 4 flavors from here and each were better than the last. We collected over 29 macarons during The Macaron Day so this was a true test as to who made the best macaron. It was a unanimous decision within my friends that their macaron had the best filling and perfect chewiness. The passion fruit macaron was all our favorite because it had a bright flavor that was both light and tart. We were sick of tasting so many macarons but even so, the passion fruit truly stuck out in our minds. Would come back again because of how well made the cookies are compared to the rest.

The burger was juicy and delicious and I really enjoyed the ambiance and can't say how much I enjoyed myself. My date however was not as hot as her online profile but who cares?

"Looks like a fun spot. Even overhead someone say ""it looks too fancy"" as they walked by looking for a brunch spot.  Not the case. At all. Been here three times previous to this most recent trip. Once for dinner, mediocre, once for happy hour, did the trick and for lunch, over cooked burger. Not sure now why I went back to check out brunch, but wanted to sit outside in my hood. The food here is fine. It's not for foodies, or someone looking for a ""French comfort food."" But it's fine. The thing that disappoints monumentally, is the poor service. We had three or four different servers help during our endless brunch. Not a one fulfilled a request we made completely. We had to sit with empty ""unlimited"" brunch drink glasses, ate French toast with ONE set of silverware between the two of us, even though we asked several times for another set. There are TWO people dining. How is one set of silver ware in any way ok? And letting empty glasses sit, finished meals left in front of us when they asked if we were done! The brunch drinks (unlimited $18) are bottom of the barrel, terrible. I'm not exaggerating. The Bloody Mary had NO flavor aside from olive. The mimosa, which I switched to thinking ""how could you screw that up?"" was disgusting. This is the worst tasting Proseco mixed with what tasted like an off brand of Tang orange drink. We were tactfully communicative in our needs and disappointments but no one seemed to care at all. $110 later and I felt sick. Will never return and suggest you don't waste your money or your time. Especially with so many other wonderful places to choose from.",0.0
"When I use to think of salad bars I use to think of getting food poisoning at Ruby Tuesday.  Them I moved to New Jack City and experienced some of the corner bodegas making fresh salads as you choose the toppings. Then I tried chop't, tossed, Just Salad and Sweet Greens as I am always eating a healthy lunch. 

All those roads led me down this path to the Mecca of salad customization. Their dressings are delicious, their proteins are all fresh, filled with flavor and nutrition.  I actually laugh at the selection at the other places... Fried chicken at chop't? Disgusting. You can tell all of the meats and half of the other toppings at the chain locations are prepared so that they can be dispersed from one location and last in the fridge for up to 14 days!  Gross who in their right mind wants to eat that.  

I can feel the nutrients coursing through my veins as I finish the salad now.  Quit having a boring salad, quit having a boring life. 

Spinach and kale, tuna, falafel, grilled kale, roasted carrots, jalepenos, fresh onion, pumpkin seeds, cherry tomatoes, avocado, quinoa, Bulgarian feta. Miso carrot ginger dressing. 

Who makes these dressings?  My mind is blown.",0.0
"I was really excited to try this place after having heard good things from others. 

We arrived on a regular weekday night, were seated immediately, and the staff was more than pleasant. Ordered the pierogies with chanterelle mushrooms and YUM they were delicious. I probably could eat these every day for the rest of my life and not get sick of them, fo realz.

I then ordered the eggplant which I wasn't impressed with at all. It was super bland and pretty greasy fried. I'm sure it's super authentic but it didn't satisfy my taste buds. The mashed potatoes were unimpressive but I did appreciate the shredded beets which made up for it. 

My husband had the chicken with herbs which was a good size portion but also not that impressive. I suppose my taste buds were just expecting something more.

I'd consider coming back for the pierogies but that's about it.",0.0
"So I ordered from Pro Thai through seamless and didn't realize that they are brand spanking new! I ordered the green curry lunch special. I often judge Thai restaurants by their green curry because it is my favorite dish and requires a deft hand with the spices to give it a nice complex flavor. Pro Thai passed my green curry test! I'll be back for the green curry probably weekly now. I tried the pad see ew the next day (I'm sick which is why I'm ordering so much) and it was decent but not the best I've ever had. Maybe that could be improved over time? Not sure how though as I'm no chef. I did like that the lunch special had an appetizer (I chose the shrimp dumpling), and I ordered the tom yum soup that also came with it. They were both delicious. So far so good! I'm glad they are in my neighborhood :) P.S. I should add that their delivery was super quick. Probably less than 30 minutes from the moment I ordered to my door!",0.0
"What is UP with this Rite Aid.   I hate the fact that it's so unreliable because it's a few blocks from my house but I post this review as a warning to anyone attempting to use the pharmacy.  They have issues back there, I mean I can't even tell you how many times I've had mistakes, 2 of the same thing in my bag, I got there to pick up and they mixed up my insurance so didn't fill my Rx and it was THEIR misunderstanding (thanks, I have nothing else to do but wait all day when I'm sick)...the list goes on.   They have actually mixed up prescriptions because of the fact that more than one physician called different items in for my husband.  I feel like they get the worst graduates from pharmacy school.  The best part about the Rx department is that they will ring you up when there is a crazy line at the front (there almost always is). 

Second problem, the LINES.   What in the world is going on in there?  Any random time you go in there there is a line that stretches across the entire row of registers back to the first aisle where the fridge is.  I'm talking like 25 people and somehow, the manager doesn't call up additional workers to open more registers.  Yes, they got ya covered if you need your toothpaste, deoderant, soap, etc albeit more expensive than Target which isn't too far.  They also have a nice selection of seasonal items and good sales.  But seriously, do NOT go in there unless you have 25 minutes to wait in line for your three dollars-worth of purchases.  And save yourself the hassle and take to your prescription to someplace on Cortelyou.",0.0
"Horrible. The delivery guy went to the wrong address and had the nerve to tell me that maybe I typed my address wrong. He said I am ""far."" I'm not. I'm literally 8 minutes away according to Google maps. He gets to me and tells me I have to come outside to get my food cause he can't park. It's a medical building and we get all kinds of deliveries all day everyday. I'm sick and really need this soup so go outside anyway against my better judgement and get the food. He starts arguing with me. LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG. I take the food THAT I ALREADY PAID FOR and go inside. Minutes later, the same man who told me he couldn't come inside to deliver my food walks into my job demanding that I sign the delivery receipt. I CAN'T. WORST DELIVERY EVER. That guy was a jerk and the food was not worth it. Stay away. When I called the restaurant they didn't really seem to care. STAY AWAY.",0.0
"Sadly, this little coffee shop gets one star based on my patronage for over a year now. 

I stopped going in there mainly for two reasons: First and foremost, because it's a sponsor of the Ridgewood Social/Market and anyone that does business and trusts that thing Sarah Feldman cannot be trusted by association. She is a creep, a complete liar and takes credit for other people's ideas for the Market/Social. She is a jerk, her boyfriend is horribly sick in the head, and anyone doing business with her is in danger of losing out on local business (because I've learned I'm not the only one who feels this way and had a bad experience with her). 

Second: who is the guy with the glasses and tattoos and what is his problem?

We went in there on Sat, nobody there but a guy on his laptop and the first words out of his mouth were, ""Whaddya want??"" - not ""Hello, how are you?"" or ""Hey, take your time, let me know when you're ready"", but ""What do you want?"" Well, obviously we want to look at a menu first - take it easy, guy. There's no line, it's literally your job to greet people. He was rather defensive and I don't know if he had a hard night or didn't get his beauty sleep, but it was just a ridiculous experience.

It was heart wrenching because we went there every day last summer and the baristas that were dealing with a crowded tiny shop and a line out the door still showed each and every customer respect. It sucks when there's an expectation, ""Oh! I love this place! They're great!"" and then you meet that guy who scoffed at a question we asked and acted so put out by us being there. Also, the single shot in a small iced latte...? No, people... 16 oz + should have a minimum of two espresso shots, this was just iced milk with a shot.

"So... this is by far the worst DR I've been too. Perhaps maybe the worse chain drugstore. #1 the staff is just plain rude. The pharmacists are great, but the store staff seem to not know what they're job is half the time with the exception of one or two people. One guy with dreds always talks about how he should be the shift manager, but isn't -- and he does so loudly. I was sick that day and feeling crappy and I didn't want all the noise from some one who is supposed to be calm and friendly. And then some other staff members just laugh and talk and discuss the store products and if they can open them/ test them.

I want this to be a nice one because it's the closest one to me, but with the boxes everywhere and the roach I saw the other day on a box of heating pads, I just can't.",0.0
"I had the weiner schnitzel, which was very underwhelming. In fact, I don't think anything about this Michelin-starred restaurant was impressive at all. The ambiance was pretty shabby, the music played in the restaurant looped like 3 times during my time there (family and I didn't stay for more than two hours), and the waiter was very uninterested in what he had to serve us. There really isn't much to say about this place, other than that I have no idea how this place managed to earn a star. Maybe it was a bad day, maybe the good chefs were out sick that day, who knows. All I do know was that I wish that I had picked a different restaurant that night.",0.0
"This is the best ""Indian Chinese"" place on the east coast. This place reminds me of the inexpensive Chinese street food I used to eat in Bombay. Whenever it's cold or I'm plain sick I leave the city to cross the river only to come here. (I don't cross any rivers period but anything for Tangra). I usually get the lollipops, Tangra masala fried rice, chili fish, chicken Manchurian and the shrimp chow mein. This place doesn't just hit the spot it destroys it!

Three Stars

It's upstairs. It's definitely not crowded but still fairly busy. Their sushi bar only holds four to six people. I sat in the back near the soda fridge and the kitchen. The sushi only menu is $18.95 for AYCE and says at sushi bar only but they let me get it at my table. First Round: Nigiri: 2 white tuna, 2 yellowtail, 2 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 mackerel, 1 octopus, 1 spicy scallop. 

The fish and rice were surprisingly proportionate. The rice was well cook and seasoned but slightly warm for my taste. The fish was good quality. I have no fear of getting sick from the food quality but perhaps from the food quantity. 

Round 2: Spider Roll and Salmon Dream Roll. The spider roll was fried soft shell crab with cucumber and avocado topped with masago and eel sauce. The Salmon Dream had salmon and avocado with Spicy Salmon on top. Both were pretty good. Their tempura crisps are a bit stale. 

Round 3: Whole bunch of weird nigiri: some of which I don't even recognize. Striped Bass, Shrimp, Salmon Roe, Flying Fish Roe, Squid, Krab, 

Round 4: Rainbow roll and East Roll. The rainbow roll's inside is just a big chunk of cucumber and Krab meat. The fish and avocado on top was good. The East Roll had spicy tuna inside with eel, eel sauce and avocado on top. 

Total count 21 pieces of nigiri and 4 cut rolls in under 1 hour. 

The service was a bit slow but not bad 

FYI this business is run by Chinese people.",0.0
"2.5 stars Sichuan food! Not as spicy as I was expecting it to be granted that I was sick when I came here so maybe my sickness masked some of it. 

We got the pepper fried chicken which was way too fatty and too fried (if that's even possible) it could have been spicier, we got the Dan Dan noodles which were the saving grace of this place. It was AMAZINg. Great flavor although it could use a bit more peanut butter sauce. And then we go the dry pepper pot with fish. Not enough heat to it! Too much fish.. And not enough vegis. The rice was good though and the service was not the greatest since it was 7pm and I guess they wanted to get as many people in as possible. 

Not a bad place for a quick catch up dinner but sadly I would say that the restaurant isn't super authentic. I love the view though bc I can see my freshman year dorm for the seats and brings me back great memories of sharing closets and rooms that could only fit twin sized beds with no walking room.",0.0
"Some of the negative reviews say 1. small portion, but it's not unlike a chicken and rice cart portion, and 2. too spicy, but then don't get the spicy sauce (which they ask about).

The food smells delicious and tastes great, and the portions are enough for the price ($10 for their #1 option). You can't compare a cart to a korean restaurant, but it was better than a few Korean restaurants I have tried (and not as good as others).

The guy taking the order is probably the sweetest man I've ever met. This alone will brighten your day.

The only reason I am not voting 5 stars is I have worked across the street from this cart for a year and just tried it recently because it looks a bit run-down and I was afraid to get sick from the food due to that. Alas! I felt fine, btu I still think they can do with a bit of cleaning/repainting/changing the signs. At this price point though, I understand why they haven't.",0.0
"I wouldn't really call this shaved ice. More like shaved frozen flavoured milk. My friend and I decided to try it out after all the hype, and maybe it was because we went on the hottest day of the year but it was pretty good! Well, for me at least. The black sesame was very fragrant and my tongue was pleasantly met with reAL CRUSHED BLACK SESAME SEEDS. Oh boy. Topped it off with strawberry puree and red bean. Should've done condensed milk instead to keep it hella Asian, but it was still pretty good. What made me happiest though was the thermal sensitive spoons that changed colours. Ahhh, throwback to childhood.

A lot of students and couples gathered here, so I wonder why the volume of their music overpowered people's conversations. At one point it got awkwardly silent because I guess someone forgot to hit the loop button, but when it came it back on, it scared the living crap out of everyone (which was hilarious though). Also, they need to Febreze at least the entrance area because it smelt like rank diarrhea on the edge of an unclean butthole when we walked in.",0.0
"#Crawfish for #lunch!

#Pros: You don't have to wait until 5pm for the #Boil or #Claw Daddy's to open. Sometimes I want crawfish now. The #sauce was really good and buttery smelling when you open the bag. The place is huge and clean and touristy looking (which I'm calling a #Pro)

#Cons: This particular batch didn't quite fresh. The meat was tough. nothing much to #suck out of the head. Something seemed #off. But the sauce was #kickin and it tasted really good with the #potatoes and #corn that were included in a 1lb bag. Usually, you have to get 2lbs at some of the other places to get #corn and #potatoes.

#I did have big abdominal pains the next day and went to the hospital. I initially thought maybe it was the crawfish, but it turned out to be a kidney stone #unrelated. #so those of you that post on Yelp blaming a restaurant for your sickness, you should be #cautious, because it is possible it was something else.. Like remember when people got sick on #spinach across the country a few years back? Who'd ever think to blame #spinach?

"Another standard, I-can't-believer-they're-still-in-business, Park Slope diner.

They have several thousand things on the menu and yet they're all the same thing.

This is a standard diner with standard bland food.  

We went for breakfast and the omelets were terrible and the fries were soggy and the coffee was dishrag weak.

I suppose if you're starving and nothing else is open you can go in for a burger or whatever but why bother.  

I should have known better but I only ordered eggs and fries and had a Celiac/gluten reaction.  There was probably crumbs on something or batter on the grill... either way I got sick that night and I know it was from this place.  This tells me that there's a lack of cleaning in the kitchen and something was cross-contaminated.

"One of the worst experiences I've had yet. Firstly we were sat down right away and given menus,  after about 15 minutes the waitress came over to take our order and seemed agitated,  but we ignored it. Then the long wait started! There were 6 of us so we didn't pay attention to the long wait for our food but after 43 minutes something was wrong! We waved over the manager and almost at the same time the two children's meals came out, put on the table and the new waitress walked away while the manager told us our waitress got sick but the kids would get ice cream- no charge. Well another 12 minutes went by and my order came out with the new waitress who explained that no one in the back knew whose order was just sitting around! Another 15 minutes went by and two orders came out wrong, then with a really pissed off attitude the waitress grabbed the wrong orders ""to fix"" them? The correct meals came out along with the sixth dinner which was also wrong, no swiss cheese on the mushroom-swiss burger! The same old bag waitress jerked the dish off the table, brought it to the kitchen where the put 2 slices of yellow American cheese on the burger and sent it right out! Stay far away from here!

"I've picked my poison and decided to write about my experience here despite the fact that once word gets, I will have to wait for a table.

The chef put together an impeccable menu. Everything (I can say everything as I have tried everything) on the menu is crafted with a great level of expertise and care for each ingredient, all of which is extremely fresh.  The menu does change occasionally but every visit we made, we were able to have:
         - spice rubbed chicken
         - pork tenderloin
         - PEI mussels
         - marbled potatoes
         - barley risotto
         - roast pork sandwich
         - burger
Orchard is great for those looking for fresh and natural dishes. The food is prepared to be flavorful but not overpowering. They do not need to disguise their ingredients. You will not find your food overloaded with oil and grease.

The decor is inviting and comfortable.  The waitstaff is attentive and polite. Yes, we have finally found employees in a NYC restaurant that is courteous and professional. 

BYOB for now ... or not so you can save every inch of space in your stomach to try all of the dishes on the menu. You will not be disappointed!

"I love the location and ambience of the place. It feels homey. It feels like one of those places that you see in a movie where they would have a lot of regulars, and it's a daily routine for them to go to.

Now why am I only giving it a 3 star? Because the food took forever to come. And I realized it was Saturday morning, and there's a lot of people but come on. It would be nice if our waitress came by to let us know the food was almost ready, etc. To top it off, I was getting over a hang-over too, so it felt twice as long. At first I thought it was just me because I wasn't feeling good, but my friend complained too, that it was too long. So it wasn't me.

Now looking at my situation through the eyes of the waitress, she could've been thinking to herself ""Those two girls look like they're in a bad mood, I'll leave them alone.""

Anyways, I got the Nutella French Toast and it had fruits along with it. The toast itself was good, and definitely they are not greedy with their Nutella. If you love your hazelnut and chocolate, you should get this. As for the fruits, it didn't feel fresh to me. But then again, I am comparing it to the fruits I eat, and I do live in California so I'm glad to say the fruits are better here, which it should be, because it is Cali.

I will be back in NYC, and definitely still go back to Penelope, hopefully when I'm not feeling sick. And hope to give them the 5 stars on my next review.",0.0
"Ok, so I went back to J's. 

I had a bout of food poisoning from a place soon to be yelped about and needed something to settle my stomach and of course my next thought was pepperoni pizza. 

I tried pizza italia but they didn't pick up. Then called J's. Ordered a Margarita with pepperoni (medium). When I walked over to pick up, I noticed that the Margarita on display did not have fresh basil. I asked the owner / manager if they could add fresh basil. He said, no because they ran out this morning. I thought it was disappointing but cool that they were not stockpiling basil. 

The margarita was very good, even without the basil. The crust was thin (in a good way) and still needed a bit more time in the oven as it was a bit doughy, but the sauce was amazing and the texture was easily remedied by putting the pizza to warm in the oven for a couple of minutes. The pizza was about perfect size for 3 people and a great price at $17.

I'll go back. Next time, I will ask him to cook it ""well done"" and to add basil.",0.0

"Read this only IF you have a gift card: You won't be able to make a purchase or order for delivery by phone with your gift card. For some bizarre reason, 2nd Avenue Deli says they can't process what is in effect a debit.

Isn't NYC all about delivery? And considering the prices that 2nd Avenue Deli charges, this is screwy. More nutty is that the world we live in operates increasingly on doing business that doesn't require face-to-face transactions.

"It is not enough to say that I absolutely adore Pates et Traditions. So much so that my boyfriend and I make it a point to come here for brunch/lunch at least once a month. 

Let's start with the wait staff. Everyone is super friendly and very attentive to your needs. Your water gets refilled right away and they always check in on you to make sure you're doing all right. Everyone comes over with a smile on their face, which is always a plus!

The restaurant itself is quite small, but I've found that I haven't had to wait for very long since everyone is so on top of things. In the summer, you are more likely to get a seat inside since people usually like to sit outside. It may prove to be a bit more difficult to find a seat during the winter, but I promise you it's worth the wait (just get there earlier to beat the brunch rush if you can)! 
The decor is SUPER cute and it just screams 'France'. When you walk in, it doesn't feel like you're walking into a restaurant, but rather a super cozy home. Love. It.

And now the food.. oh God, the food! I haven't tried anything else but the crepes, to be honest, but the crepes have made enough of an impression on me to keep coming back. My favorite is Le Poulet Citron (chicken, onions, lemon, rosemary, swiss, and honey). Such an amazing blend of flavors! In fact, all of the crepes I've tried have been a really great blend of flavors. La Savoyarde and La Bergere are also very, very good. My boyfriend's favorite is La Sultan (chicken, bacon, cumin, swiss, cream, garlic, onions, and mint) -- I promised myself that I would get this the next time we went since I had a small bite of his and it was also quite yummy!

I'd recommend washing your crepes down with their French Lemonade sodas. The blood orange one is my favorite, but they're all great. They also make really good cappuccinos!

If a savory crepe isn't enough for you, worry not -- they have dessert crepes too! I've only had the La Banane Nutella and La Banane Chocolat and yes, they are both amazing. Their homemade chocolate is SO rich and it really reminds me of the chocolate I used to eat in France as a kid.

With all of this food, you would think that one would leave the restaurant super bloated... but I've always left very content. It's like their portions are perfectly sized to make you full, but not to the point where you feel sick.

If you're still debating whether or not to try Pates et Traditions, DEBATE NO MORE! This place is the absolute best!",0.0

"I am officially sick & tired of this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but not good enough to make up for the terrible service. The staff is always rude & abrupt, both in person & on the phone. A lot of them don't know English so when you call & one of them answers you get an annoyed grunt & then are put on hold until an equally annoyed English-speaking person comes on to take your order. If you decide to eat there the waitress takes your order & then disappears without giving you water, & then reappears with food, but still neglects to give you water. The most I saw of her was when we were paying the check, at which point she hovered ten feet away until we put our money on the table at which point she swooped in & took it away without even asking us if we wanted change. God forbid you should order delivery. If you do & they don't include everything that you ordered, then you are shit out of luck, because if you call them up to ask about it they not only will argue with you, but then proceed to curse you out over the phone. That last one was not hyperbole, it actually happened when my co-workers & I did a group order. There was at least $10 worth of food missing. One of my co-workers (who is Spanish speaking) called to let them know about the error & instead of getting an apology & a promise to deliver the food, she got abusive language & was hung-up on.

It's Not a tips, that goes to the HOUSE and the server get nothing. I still give tips to the server no matter how much % of Fees the owner charge us. It's a restaurant where the server take your drink order, clear your dishes, chat with you and gives you a smile. The server deserve the tips anyways but with the fees it make sick and cheap to our server. This ain't McDonald or BK where you don't need to tip. Won't go back if they charge me 10% of my check and goes to the GREED house.",0.0
"Quite difficult to beat a $6 breakfast M-F until 10:30am which includes coffee, eggs, and toast. All things considered, it ends up being substantial. My server willingly substituted tea for coffee which, on an occasion of being somewhat sick, I was grateful for. Truthfully I have not had anything else here but the outside seating of this restaurant is superb, it's a rather upscale dining scene on the corner of Prince and Lafayette without being too button-up. If you are coming to drink with a group, there exists a great garden area with couch seating down the steps near the ""mini-bar"" area. Service is good and you feel sufficiently cared after. I'll edit this review if I make it here for anything besides breakfast.",0.0
"I used to go here all the time- they have great bagels! One time, I was accidentally given the wrong bagel- I ordered gluten free and they gave me a regular bagel. Thankfully I noticed prior to eating it (since the bagels look different). No problem! Mistakes happen. I called and spoke with someone who said he was the owner... And I explained what happened and he told me that his people don't make mistakes! Lol... So you must hire the most efficient people in the world.... 

Anyway I told him, not to worry... I'll be in tomorrow, so they can exchange it for me. He said NO! I'm not giving you anything! I was shocked since my boyfriend and I were very regular customers there for years!!!!! The staff there seems good, but as a business owner (I'm still hoping he wasn't the owner! But I'm sure he was) you should be a bit nicer! especially since i could have been very sick. 

We miss coming to you guys, but we won't spend another penny here! His finishing line to me was that he doesn't need me as a customer- which is probably true... But I hope you miss all the money you used to make off of everyone else that I've told this story to.",0.0
"Don't get me wrong, this place isn't bad. It's just not good either. For the price range that they serve, better Japanese food can be had.

I frequently eat near the Rego Park subway stop, and the area actually has pretty good food. I've been to Bamboo Ya a couple of times because the hours are somewhat longer than the competition. The food itself is pretty par for the course for American-Japanese food. The sushi isn't that fresh, but it's not going to make you sick either. The flavors in general are somewhat sweeter/toned-down than one would expect from a Japanese restaurant. The drink selection is pretty mediocre, which doesn't mesh well with the amount of space the bar takes up.",0.0
"LOVE this place! Yes, the cocktails are expensive but they taste so good, so its worth it to splurge! The paddington is their most popular and I highly recommend it.  The concept of going into the phone booth to get back to the bar is very neat. Make sure to get reservations in advance because the line is super super long. A great place to go with friends!

"Feeling how I assume the non-invincible do when they're ""sick"", it seemed like a perfect time to redeem my Amazon Local voucher here*. This bright and modern space employed a too-large staff and comically handed out a buzzer to the only patron (this guy), but never actually signaled it when ready, joking about this move. Also scored the tasty Harney and Sons iced green tea with Yelp check-in, which the very friendly staffer even forgot about after some confusion with the registers, or they just hoped I forgot about requesting. The three recommended items - carolina bbq chicken, loco moco, and moroccan tofu were all substantial enough and nutritious for the price, I just wish there weren't so many boastful signs everywhere.

"50%.  It has a nice ring to it, but when the prices are doubled its worth and not reflective of the quality of rolls received, it tends to lose its appeal.  I used to frequent Sushi Park as a college student and for a few years thereafter.  It was great for the prices on fish that wouldn't make you sick.  Since then, I developed a liking to more authentic places, and SP is not one of them.  

It operates almost like a sushi diner would.  The rolls come out pretty quickly, but won't be winning any awards for presentation or quality.  They have way too many menu items in the special rolls section.  And, the rolls all include many of the same ingredients with only one or two differences.  It's a complete waste of space and they would do well to focus on less.  

$3 Sapporo glasses almost make up for the sushi flop.  However, there are places that offer colder and more carbonated Sapporo for less.  

The rolls I received had too much tempura in it; I couldn't taste my already mashed up spicy salmon.  It's really cheap quality at a not-so-cheap price.  The special rolls average at $15 a pop.  The 50% is only applied when an individual's order has reached the minimum of $14.  Though the half off discount is applied to most sashimi as well, this doesn't include the uni.  Yes, read that fine print!

They can charge more than the sushi place around the corner, on St. Mark's Place, only because their space is cleaner and larger.  Other than that, I hope to avoid in the future.",0.0
"Love this place! They guy who's always there is very helpful and nice. When they first opened, he'd give me one size larger than what I paid for :) 
Also, whatever problem I have when I go in...hungover, sick, tired, or just simply craving for a delicious juice, they always know what to make you! :) frozen yoghurt is good too..they have many toppings available. Although I wish they had a few more frozen yoghurt flavor options, especially for the spring & summer. 
One more thing...I understand why they picked that neon green color for the wall..but jeez, it hurts my eyes! I'd definitely chance the wall color.",0.0
"There have been weeks at a time when Ali's was feeding me nightly. I would try to convince myself to cook or try something else, but the rotis are so perfect! I feel like the food is made with good ingredients (I never feel heavy or sick after eating from there). My favorites are the boneless chicken roti and the veggie roti ($6!). Roti skin is magic and I think Ali's is the best. 

This is at the top of my list when I want to point to places in the neighborhood that help give it it's specific flavor. 

I was disappointed to see the old sign go! I hope they kept it somewhere. I thought it was so lovely and homey.",0.0
"A very good noodle shop with fresh flavors and long waits. Apparently you have to eat the noodles in less than 15 mins or they don't taste as good. The wait is very long so go as early or late as possible. 

I went on a Saturday and from ordering to takeout took 30 mins. This is the longest I have waited for Chinese food, ever!

I ran back to the office with a warm bag and then realized they didn't give me one dish. I had to quickly eat the noodles and then run back for the tofu which was eaten there. 

The sodium levels are low so you don't feel sick after eating it like other places. The meat is also authentic unlike other restaurants that use thin sliced frozen meat. 

So the next time I'm walking by and don't see a line I will pop in and try something else.",0.0

"Everything is farm to table and bought locally. Every week, a new animal or food is featured and the menu completely changes, so its hard to get sick of their food.

"Ew, Ew & double EW!  I came in with a friend on a Saturday night for dessert and this place was practically empty.  We had to wait a year and a day before someone came over to us ( I was on the verge of walking out).  Finally, we ordered a piece of cake that we decided to share just to see if we would like it.  It was called 'Death By Chocolate.""  I can't even begin to describe how disgusting this cake was.  It must have been at least a week old.  The cake was hard like a rock so was the pudding and so called mousse.  Hopefully, their other desserts are not as sickening, but with this first experience being such a horror, I wouldn't want to go back to find out.",0.0
"This was tasty, but a bit bland. Waiter was great, and politely switched a dish my friend didn't like. The lamb biryani was fatty and boney, chicken Tikka was delicious and mild, and although It might be the dirtiest restaurant we ate in all week, at least we didn't get sick :)",0.0
"Confession: I did not get paid to come here, and I had a delicious seafood meal at Red & Gold Boil. They currently have a 25% off boils offer, which brings down the $35-$45 boils to to $26-$34. You can choose from two varieties of crabs, lobster, and shrimp - I went with the crab. Each boil will serve two people comfortably, so be sure to bring a friend when you come.

We ordered an appetizer of soft shell crabs, which were fresh and fried skillfully. That got us suitably hungry for the crab boil, which came unceremoniously in a clear plastic bag in a metal bucket. The server untied the knotted plastic bag, rolled down the edges of the bag, and invited us to tuck in. After securing the flimsy plastic bibs around our necks, we proceeded to eat our way through the food. The Old Bay seasoning that's a little spicy was quite perfect. I think the owners have since taken into account complaints on Yelp that the broth was bland to heart - the broth was savory and flavorful, if not a tad bit too salty, but penetrated the crab and vegetables very well.

I liked the corn, potatoes, shrimp, and mussels that came as part of the boil too. It provided a breather when I was sick of prying crabmeat out of unyielding shells and was a great medium to transport the flavor to my mouth.

Despite the cheesy exterior of this restaurant (cartoon crab?!), I think it is poised to succeed if it continues with delicious, quality food.",0.0
"I came here for a weekday brunch. Service was superb! Decoration was beautiful. I went out the night before so I was kinda hangover. We had a tasting menu and through the middle of it, I was literally passing out. I got super sick all a sudden n I think it had to do with me going all out the night before. They packed the rest of my tasting menu up and My friend carried me into a cab with boxes of what's left of my meal. 8 hours later I woke up and finished the whole meal. That's when I realized how amazing it was. 8 hours leftover food straight out of a refrigerator (not even heated coz I was too out of it to heat it)  n it was sooo good! One of the best ducks I ever tasted! Ricotta was also great. And the dessert was on point. I'd definitely go back again!",0.0

"So my friend and I went to see the play Constellations one night... and then we ran to a bar with a TV to catch the end of the Seahawks game... after which we were hungry and wanted somewhere cute and quiet to hang out and catch up (since there was really no time to chat during the play and during the game). I remembered that Stanton Street Kitchen FINALLY opened and suggested we go there, especially since I called the restaurant and the kitchen was still open! (It was almost 11pm and a lot of the other bars with open kitchens had no seating.)

S & I got a chance to meet almost everybody involved with the business - the co-owner/chef, the waitstaff, the other co-owner/manager and the co-owner/manager's parents... who also helped fund the business. The chef, Erik Blauberg, was the chef at 21 for 8 years, so I expected amazing food that night - and I definitely wasn't disappointed. The staff is seriously nice. This is a place where you won't be afraid to eat alone at the bar because the bartender and the waitstaff will chat with you if it's not a busy night. Since this place just opened, it definitely hasn't been too busy yet - but I'm hoping that will change. (I really want this place to be successful.)

The restaurant itself is quite pretty - whoever decorated must have really like candles because they're everywhere. I'm not sure whether I like it or not, but overall it gives off a romantic mood. So great for a date... or a fun low-key girls' night out.

I ended up getting the mini burger (I was hungry but not super hungry) and S got a pasta. Both were delicious - the mini burger was more like a slider, but perfect for something hearty yet light at 11pm. S said her pasta was delicious. The goat cheese cheesecake was also absolutely amazing - although I do wish I did end up waiting 20 minute for that chocolate soufflé - we ended up staying for a while anyway.

The wine selection is quite nice, but the beer selection is even better according to S. I can't quite drink beer (I always get really sick the next day), but she says the beer selection and cellar is on par (and maybe even better) than the recently closed culturefix. Tons of microbrews and the waitresses actually know their beers - if you know what type of beer you like, they'll recommend a few, let you taste them (if they're on tap) and you're almost guaranteed to like one of the options.

So here's a warm welcome Stanton Street Kitchen to the neighborhood! I can't wait to come back in a few weeks when they start serving brunch - I'm so super excited!!",0.0

"If you're sick of waiting for a table for brunch go to Station LIC. The couple of times I've been for weekend brunch/dinner, the place has only been half full. I think it's because it's a little off the well-beaten path of Vernon Blvd. The food is excellent. The ponzi burger is delicious and rivals Bareburger in my opinion! The fries are excellent and I don't even really like fries. They are super crispy. My whole family goes nuts for 'em. 

The creme brulee french toast is a bit decadent for breakfast but certainly worth a try. 

The chicken and waffle special they sometimes have during brunch is off the charts! The fried chicken and waffle are both excellent and Station LIC goes the extra mile and tops the whole thing with a slice of ham and a fried egg. SO yummy. The definition of comfort food! 

The staff is always pleasant and the atmosphere is super cool. I just really dig this place! It's great!",0.0
"My absolute favorite Saturday activity. All my friends ask how I can go every Saturday without getting sick of it. My answer is simple: there are so many options and everything is always delicious. It can get overwhelming because there is so much to choose from and there are so many people, but I think that's part of the experience.

"This is our third visit in four years, and it has been slowly getting more disappointing.  The garden feels more neglected than ever.  The interior is feeling less like a restaurant and more like a rumpus room.

But, the food...

Don't know if they stopped the kale chip amuse bouche, but it would've been nice.

First, the main course menu has been pared down to a few burgers, a few hot dogs, and a mac and cheese.  

The star -- the burger -- was unavailable.  I ordered the GF burger with potato fries.  What I got was the driest, crumbliest veggie burger ever.  Bland and dry.  I ate it with a fork until I was sick of eating it.  It came on a ""bun"" which was truthfully the dryness, the texture, and the *weight* of MDF board.  Seriously.  I'm astonished because these people are supposed to be vegan experts, and when your menu is all burgers and dogs, you better be a maestro at them.

Potato wedges were crispy outside, but again, dry inside.

Also ordered was the mac and cheese, with its chew cream.  Also extremely dry.  Pasta was way overcooked and floppy.

Appetizer of gazpacho was nice, but please leave the pink peppercorns off of it -- they have a strong flavor that seriously does not work with cucumber gazpacho.

Staff is nice and welcoming.

The beer was handed to me at the register from a girl who was pleasant which was nice, but that's about the only compliment I have from my experience.

I would not go again and the only reason they didn't receive a 1 star is because I didn't get sick from the food.",0.0
"I've not yet visited for brunch, but I went for dinner on a weekend with 4 other people, and we were seated within 25 minutes. We split 2 market plates (each including 4 veggies) as a table, and they were fantastic. In 2 $15 orders, we got the following:

-Asparagus
-Roasted beets with goat cheese (My favorite of all, and I'm not generally a huge fan of beets)
-Broccoli
-Brussels sprouts (still good, but definitely the weakest of the 8 sides)
-Sweet potato fries
-Pesto mashed potatoes
-Cauliflower
-Fried plantains

The market plates are great for sharing and surprisingly filling--I also ordered a burger but was almost completely full by the time it came, even after sharing with 4 other people. This place is great for vegetarians sick of finding themselves stuck with limited veggie options on menus (many of the market place options seem to be vegan-friendly, as well), or for groups looking to split dishes for a reasonably priced meal. Will definitely be returning.",0.0

"One exceptionally unique dining experience. Like many reviews stated before, I was exceptionally surprised to see such a place open up in Midtown East. Avocado toast and kale salad? The dream brunch meal of all millennials. My friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon and had the most interesting experience.

- watched as one of the waitstaff brought in tropicana grapefruit juice from food emporium across the street and quickly poured it into two glasses
- watched as ""iced coffee"" was made by pouring just brewed hot coffee over ice (we overheard passive aggressive comments from the overworked staff noting that the previous nights shift did not make/refrigerate the coffee as what seemed like standard practice)
- despite the large number of waitstaff crowding the kitchen, everything seemed to be running inefficiently
- from what we gathered the restaurant has issues with staffing as apparently someone called in sick an hour before and thus threw the restaurant entirely off.
- we were told to take a seat at the bar but we're not even acknowledged or addressed until one of us went over to ask for a menu
- we had to wait until the overwhelmed and overworked bartender had a brief second in between drinks to take our order
- took another 30 minutes until we were given water and silverware
- after we finished we sat there in silence as we watched a flurry of wait staff rush around, while helping people who had just come up to the bar instead of asking if we'd like anything else. It even took another 10 minutes before someone who looked like a manager or partner noticed and poured us more water.
- we waited another 10 minutes for our check to be processed - apparently only the bartender was allowed to help us so we were stuck waiting while she made drinks for people who just walked up.

So while this seems like an entirely negative review - the food is the saving grace of this place.

It seemed like everyone was getting the avocado toast with egg, but my friend and I were drawn in by the burger (promising 28 day aged angus beef). It was exceptional - juicy, cooked to the requested medium rare, and the bun and assorted accoutrements were all on point. We both opted to add the avocado and egg which definitely made the burger even better.

Like previous reviews mentioned and we also gathered - the poor efficiency and service is not the fault of the employees but whoever is managing the restaurant. ""Managing"" should really be in quotation marks here.  Bottom line is if you have the patience and are amused by watching a train wreck, come try this place out! service was a 0.5 out of 5, but food is a 4 out of 5!",0.0

"Didn't know where to eat on a Friday night, and walked in here at around 9pm with two friends - party of 4.  I think it would be safer to make reservations, as the restaurant was completely full, however because it was a little later, a party was just leaving so we only had to wait a few minutes before being seated.

While standing and waiting for about 5 minutes, we realized this place is LEGIT! The restaurant ambiance makes you feel like you're in japan, AND there was the added factor that we were the only non-japanese people in the entire restaurant.  The restaurant is relatively small, tables are all separated and have quite a bit of privacy.  From what I remember, there are only 4 or 5 tables which accommodate parties of 4-8.  There is also seating at the bar, which was all full when we first walked in.  

When we sat down, the waiter explained to us how this restaurant has been around for 3 years, and they've worked on maintaining the quality of their food and reputation more than getting themselves out there as a restaurant.  (They are located on 53rd street on one of the lower levels - so technically they are below ground level, however, from the inside of the restaurant, it doesn't feel underground at all!)

We went with the $80 Chef Tasting Course 

Assorted Starter 
They call this an amuse-bouche, however there are about 10 different things on this little plate, it's amazing!

Oyster
Definitely the largest oyster I've ever had, perfectly cooked, tender with an amazing sauce/flavor.  I don't like how sometimes oysters taste a little like the ocean, but this did not taste like that at all!

5 Kinds of Sashimi
I thought this was very high quality - the fatty tuna is always my favorite and was amazing.  I've only had fatty tuna this good in Japan, never in the US even at other very expensive restaurants. I was very impressed!

Seafood of the day - Lobster and Abalone 
Presentation was beautiful and flavors were amazing.  My husband got the lobster, loved it, so much goodness my vocabulary is not big enough to do it justice.  Same for the Abalone.  So tender, (sometimes abalone is too chewy for me, but this one was a great cut and perfectly cooked) came with mushrooms blue cheese.  The combination of the melted blue cheese was so delicious!  I liked the abalone more, my husband liked the lobster more.

Special Sashimi 
An additional 3 pieces of sashimi, very tender, very high quality! 

Meat - Ribeye Steak (+$5) and Duck Confit 
The extra $5 for the ribeye is totally worth it if you like Japanese wagyu fatty meat.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly with such quality, fatty (where the fat is in the meat and you can't even see it) beef.  It practically melts in your mouth!
Duck Confit was also amazing, very tender, great flavor, falls right off the bone.  Amazing.

Udon (cold) 
I love how they make this filling dish last in the tasting menu, so you fill your stomach with all the good quality fish/meat, and if you're still hungry, you can enjoy this, however, all the above was already a lot of food for me, so I didn't feel bad wasting some of this starchy stuff.  But it's a cold noodle dish, no one else at the table loved it, but I love cold noodles, and the noodle texture was perfect.  I was just so full I couldn't finish it!

Dessert of the Day 
Our party of 4 split all the desserts so we could try them all, and they were all VERY VERY good.  We were so full from all the other courses, we didn't even really want dessert, but we ate ALL of the below.  Portions are smaller (which I like in desserts), gives you enough sweetness to end your meal, but not so much that you feel sick after finishing it!

White Sesame Blancmange $5
Texture of crème brulee or flaun, light, not too sweet, amazing white sesame flavor (if you like that).  

Home Made Ice Cream Yogurt $6
Very very good, loved the tartness and I just love homemade ice cream in general. 

Black Team Panna Cotta $5
This was everyone's favorite dessert, it taste like pearl milk tea crème brulee texture. Light, not too sweet, delicious! 

Chocolate Truffle with Green Tea Matcha $5
Chocolate was amazing, but I think there was a little too much green tea matcha powder, made it a little too bitter for my liking. Still delicious and very high quality, the other desserts were just so amazing this is probably my least favorite.

In Summary - Ambiance, look and feel are authentic and amazing. Restaurant is clean, feels pretty fancy (minus that they are below ground level). Service was spectacular! Food quality and presentation was top notch.  LOVED this place, will be back again to try $55 pre fixe and another time to just order small dishes!

The sand which was delicious and on point. Healthy option. My mom had the curry chicken salad. Pretty tasty, but I feel like due to the dressing, I'd get a little sick of it half way. Other than that, this is an awesome place with good music and nice workers. Recommend this place to morning people and I'd say it's a good place for morning couples to start their day.",0.0
"This place has ascended to legendary status among New York City Yelpers such that I have heard many rumors of Keybar UYEs with 50 or more people attending, based on the strength of its reputation alone. For whatever godly reason, Keybar's ""happy hour"" lasts six hours and offers two-for-one drinks (buy a $12 dollar drink, get a free drink coupon for the next one). 

Realistically, I do not think a human could last all six happy hours without incurring alcohol poisoning because in addition to being tasty, the two-for-one drinks are more than strong. I had two sips of a Bloody Orange Zygo Martini and I felt off my face, despite the fact that I had eaten beforehand. The Lychee Martini was the most subtle drink on the menu and it was my favorite of the four I had that night because I could barely detect the alcohol.

At some point, the bar itself becomes lit like a whorehouse since by 9pm or so everything was a deep red while the venue itself had reached maximum capacity (what looked like 30 or so persons made the bar feel minuscule). 

Based on the six hour drink specials alone, this place warrants repeated entry but our bartender was also a professional. She was pleasant and was able to make well-blended drinks quickly and without pause, despite the fact that the bar's populace had reached fire-hazard levels in the last hour of drink specials. I am eagerly returning to Keybar for a birthday party Saturday, so obviously I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone. 

Update: An Australian Yelper just e-mailed me to tell me that she has heard of the Yelp-related parties at Keybar.",0.0
"I'm sad this place doesn't have WiFi anymore, but the food is just so good. They have my favorite croissants in the city, and their croque madame is tied with Cafe D'Alsace's for #1.

While the coffee (La Colombe) isn't the cheapest, it's always well brewed, and the price isn't outrageous for Manhattan. Agree it's silly that they don't do refills in the restaurant in the back (would add a fifth star if they did that and got the WiFi back) -- but there's a way around it. Just sit in the front part of the cafe. You have to grab your stuff from the counter yourself, but you can order from the regular menu and bring your mug up for those refills.

We've been coming here for about 2.5 years and haven't gotten sick of it yet, if that counts for anything.

They get major points for this one morning when I'd forgotten my wallet. They told me to just pay the next time I came in, and that kind of generosity stands out more to me than weird refill rules. (I don't live far and just came right back, but they didn't know I was going to do that.)",0.0

She also forgot to bring out my avocado toast twice..and didn't even seem apologetic about it. My mocha was lukewarm..I understand she was busy because she seemed to be attending to a lot of tables at once but I wasn't too happy with her attitude/demeanor.

FOOD: We ordered the mocha, watermelon juice, avocado toast, and the couscous. I would definitely recommend the couscous, it was very delicious! But, I think it is best to be split between two people because it does get a little boring towards the end (aka I got sick of it). So I think we made a good choice to order the avocado toast and the couscous together so that we could have a bit of each and not get too bored of one dish.

Overall, if the service had been better I would have definitely given this place better reviews. Maybe I'll have to try it out again",0.0
"I started coming to Brazilia when they first opened last year and stopped after experiencing one too many hiccups (wrong order, rude attitude, etc.). I went back to Brazilia fairly recently to give them another chance. The quality of their products (while expensive) is decent, but I will not be returning to them for their business. I really did not appreciate a couple of employees' defensiveness  and pettiness when I returned the coffee I ordered this morning. I cannot drink whole milk, it makes me sick. I was not rude or obnoxious about it, I just simply requested to exchange it for the skim iced late I originally ordered.

I'm never one to think ""the customer is always right"", and I never carry myself in that way. However, I also don't believe a simple misunderstanding of a customer's order warrants an obnoxious confrontation by business employees, especially if that customer comes regularly and works right around the corner with others who purchase their products on a regular basis.",0.0
"I probably go here 2-3 times a week and I can never get sick of this place. 

The plate is a pretty big serving especially for the price but the pita is filling as well. Pork or lamb/beef with GRK sauce is the way to go. The fries are really good too!",0.0
"This place officially has gone down the shitter.  I don't know the whole story but it appears that they often fire or replace their staff every 2-3 months.  Recently Juan the cook left (whether he was fired or quit, I dont know), who has been the only fixture of stability in that place.  He was there long before these new ""owners"" took over about 2 years ago, and have probably been the only reason folks stuck around.

The shop seems to operate on its own schedule as of late, and at least once every week or so, just doesn't open at all.  Or open hours later than they're supposed to.  This neighborhood is pretty relaxed, but with the outrageous coffee prices they have, along with non sensical business hours, and out of touch owners, everyone is pretty sick of Cafe Edna.",0.0
"I've eaten here many times, though lately less often for dinner because of the unpleasant noise level. In general the food has been very good. I had dinner here 8/6, during restaurant week, and found the restaurant seriously off its game. Lovely waitress, but very off-hand servers who tended to throw the food down.(and what's with putting down both pieces of bread on one person's plate and expecting that they'll hand the second one to their companion??) The summer salad was tasty, though loaded with way too much dressing and crammed into a tiny bowl. The ahi tuna main course was also over-dressed and arranged with the other ingredients in a soggy mound on the plate. Chocolate cake for dessert was very good. Every restaurant has off-days, but i had the impression that they were sick of people coming for the restaurant week menu. So disappointing for what had been a neighborhood favorite.",0.0
"My son took me to the Breslin and told me about the scotch egg and lamb burger.  We had a party on 7. We  seat upstairs, overlooking the kitchen.  The thing I saw that made me sick was, one of the cooks, on the left side front cooking and took a spoon to taste the dish and after tasting it he put the spoon back in the same dish.  That's a no no.  The scotch egg was very good.  The lamb burger and fries, was very salt.  I looked into the kitchen again and noted that, they was put a layer of salt on both sides of the burger, not a touch, but layers of salt.  Would I go back, only if I can tell them, how I would the burger cook, very little salt. Sorry about the past two review, which is the same one I'm posting today.

"Dear Dough,

I had heard about you through my friends who said I HAD to try this doughnut place in Brooklyn.

Thank you for moving closer to me.

You are the most perfectly fluffy, delicious, satisfying doughnut I have ever had. 

I'm so glad that I walked an extra 5 blocks and 3 avenues from my doctor's office when I was deathly sick just so I could have your dough. It was completely worth it.

Forever yours,

"I've given them numerous chances to improve their service and the most recent interaction has proven they will never do so.

Today I ordered waffles and the California fruit salad as well as a lentil soup for my sick girlfriend. The total was 26 on my grub hub, when the order arrived i thanked the delivery guy and gave him 30. Apparently they were out of lentil soup and had subtracted it from my order without calling to see if perhaps I would like something else, the delivery guy knew this and instead of telling me the total or that they were out of soup gladly took the $8 tip and hustled down the stairs. I called to let the girl know as soon as I noticed  I hadn't received my soup she told me they only had chicken noodle. out of almost a dozen soups on the menu the only one available was chicken noodle!  Well ok I'll take the chicken noodle I suppose. She says she will send it and I hang up. I go to open the Cali fruit salad this salad is two different types of melon a couple slices of strawberry some red jello and cottage cheese. And California fruit salad is typically citrus fruits and mango and such but ok I can deal, but wait they've decided to sprinkle nuts all over the top but that we're not listed on the menu  and I have a severe food allergy so time to call back again. This time I sit on hold for seven minutes the same girl answers the phone I explain that the fruit salad had nuts. Her response is ""well yes all out fruit salad does"" I explain that it's not listed on the menu and that I have a food allergy she again tells me well it's on all the fruit salad and at this point has an ""im annoyed with you"" tone. I tell either send me a refund for my salad with my now chicken noodle soup or send me another salad with no nuts so I can actually eat it. After 40 MINUTES! They send a small container with a little bit of cut fruit no cottage cheese no jello just a few pieces of fruit And finally a soup.  

I will never order from these guys again there's far too many other good options",0.0

Their sandwich is to die/kill for! So good!! People are so fun and friendly. Portions are huge! Wish I wasn't sick, so I could try cocktails too! 
Wish I could kidnap the whole place with people working here and take back to SF with me!!!

"Zero stars for this place. Went there for the first time last week, loved it! Super excited to see a gluten free option. No problems on visit one. Today, I went in there to order two different orders, one was gluten free. I took my order home and was surprised to see ""gf"" on the order that should have been regular. Basically they reversed them. I luckily didn't eat them bc of course I would have been really sick. I called to get a credit for the food that I threw out and the person who answered the phone blamed me! Apparently I should have made it more clear that I was allergic to gluten... Ummmm you have a gluten free menu, isn't that enough? She then continues to blame me for not saying I was allergic! Again-- you have a gluten free menu! Not one apology-- rude rude rude rude. Keep it up! Park slope customers won't deal with your nonsense. I'm looking forward to seeing my credit on my card. 
All in all- if you have a gluten allergy-- apparently a REAL allergy then I'd stay away. For anyone else, the food was good the first time- so if you have nothing to worry about then go for it! Otherwise, I wouldn't take the chance :)",0.0
"I really like this place. Unfortunately their delivery is not great. My boyfriend and I are sick and ordered a bunch of juices. They were out of one kind we ordered and simply didn't send it. They claimed to have tried to call to tell us they were out, but no missed calls/messages left. When I called asking, they did not properly communicate they were out of the juice I ordered. All I was told was the bill was adjusted - I thought this was a courtesy for the delivery being late. A miscommunication, but the woman on the phone was pretty aggressive - I was told there were ""5 other orders""... every order should be equally important. 

I would have appreciated an offer for a different kind of juice instead. Being sick and not being able to go out is bad enough which is why delivery is genius. But to wait an hour and fifteen for two juices is not really worth the trouble. 

Further, the prices are quite high and I spend a lot of money here every week so the courtesy would have been lovely.",0.0
"I've been coming here since it opened (sometimes more than once a week!) as I really love the food. This past Friday night (January 23rd) I brought a few friends here and I was so disappointed. 
We decided to go to the bar before we sat at a table and the bartender was the rudest person I've ever encountered. Not sure his name but he has dark brown hair and an almost grown in foe-hawk? (not sure if that's the term). Anyway, he was nasty to not just me but most of the people he was serving. Complaining (loudly) about other guests at the bar to me and just so disgustingly inappropriate.  Can't the owner find nicer bartenders? I felt like he was a manic patient  at a hospital that you didn't want to anger bc he might have a crazy episode. We ended up not staying for dinner since his demeanor made me sick. 
I guess I'll take a break from bringing people to 282 or coming here full stop since his bad attitude completely turned me off to the place. Frankly it scares me that he's in the service industry.",0.0
"My husband went into this Rite Aid at about 11 PM last week Monday because my 1 year old was sick. I was waiting for my husband in the car. When he came back to the car with the medicine I realized he picked out a medicine for the age group of 4 and above. My husband had asked the cashier to trash the receipt thinking he got the right medicne. It had literally been less than 4 minutes before I went back in to exchange it for the appropriate age group. I should the cashier the medicne and told him my husband had just purchased it. He was the only cashier working that night and the store was empty. I reminded him that my husband had just been in there and asked him to throw out the reciept. He claimed he sees too many customers to remember my husband. I am like ""really? He literally just walked out and the store is pretty empty"" - He directs me to his manager, who was standing next to him a register over. I explain to the manager again and the manager is giving me attitude and not even giving me eye contact as he is looking through some papers. He states that without a receipt he can't do anything. I remind him that my husband was just there and that I am sure his cashier would remember who he was because there was no one else in the store. He continues to be dismissive and rude so I just leave. 

I went over to the Rite Aid on or near 170 St. & Broadway. The manager and the cashier there were so helpful and curtious, and while they couldn't give me a full refund because I didn't have a receipt, they were able to give me half my money back and I was able to exchange the medicine to the correct one. 

I would recommend everyone saves themselves the trouble and just head on over to the Rite Aid on 170 St.",0.0
"This is fabulous.  I'm busy; so is my husband.  I have gotten sick of trying to plan meals, we can't get a lot of gourmet ingredients where we live, and after years of cooking...not my passion anymore.  So, when I heard about this from a friend (and got the coupon for a free meal), I thought ""why not"".  But, my husband is pretty particular about what he eats...and I thought he might be a tough sell.  I have to admit we're just getting started, but the first two meals are a hit!!!  Easy to prepare and the cleanup is minimal....and with ingredients I have no hope of getting here out in the middle of nowhere.

"Came here two days after Christmas to avoid the crowd but it is located at Time Square so its always busy. But thanks to OpenTable I made reservations for 8pm. 
Arrived at 7:50pm and made me wait like 5 minutes and seated me upstairs. This place is pretty big but overly crowded with the closeness of the tables. When I pulled to sit on my chair it was touching the another table behind me. Our server was grumpy looking but she eventually told us she was coming down with a flu. 

I ordered the watermelon margarita, was good but not worth the price and I barely taste the tequila & I love tequila so i know. But I had a passion fruit margarita which was a bit stronger but way too sweet. As for the food I got the choose two protein and sides, I chose ribs with the sauce and brisket, mash potatoes and mac & cheese and Hush puppies. The hush puppies was good for like the first 3 after that I got sick of eating it. The food came right after, the meat looked so dry and the brisket was disgusting, the ribs was okay but the dried rub ribs taste so much better and the mac & Cheese taste like box mix. I def had better but hey at least I can say I tried it but I would not come back here again. Its been real!",0.0
"I had a company event here and everything was absolutely perfect.  The service- more than enough staff to handle our table of 7 and the rest of the full restaurant. (They bring you pedestals for your purses, so they don't have to sit on the floor!)  Eric was in charge of our table and he kept everything flowing beautifully and was so patient with my increasingly rowdy (for ladies) table.

We did the tasting menu with wine pairing and ended up with 10 courses. (Though they called one a ""bread course""- while served with delicious butter and honeycomb and was my favorite, pumpernickel- is still not a course in my opinion.) and all allergies and preferences were accomodated with minimal fuss. The food was EXCELLENT and served at that perfect intersection of beauty, taste, appropriate timed progression, and scale.  We left very full but not, ""I can't finish"" full and were able to eat everything.  (Kudos to the kitchen person who stacks tooothpick sized slivers of sauced and fermented carrots into the white picket horse corral of my childhood dreams- the attention to detail was GREAT!!)

Everything I have described is what makes this an excellent restaurant that you should not hesitate to RUN to but the wine pairing, OH THE WINE PAIRING... IS DIVINE!!!!!

There were several points in the meal where traditional wine pairings could have been defaulted to but our sommelier, Juan, was adorable, knowledgable, patient. but inventive as all hell. There wasn't what I would consider to be ""classical pairing"" (Sauternes and foie gras, any one?- nope- they didn't!) that was used.  Instead he chose wines which highlighted some of the undertones of our dishes and highlighted unexpected flavours and just knocked it out of the park for me in adventurousness.  He even found us a Greek wine that I didn't hate (that was a FIRST!)  But the absolute crown jewel was his last pairing.  I still don't know what it was (I asked for a listing of our wines to be emailed to us-but we still haven't received it but can't wait til I do!)  

The portions for the extensive wine pairing were perfect.  Most of us started with an amazing cocktail off the cocktail menu before dinner and while we all got drunk, no one got sick and while we were all a little hung over (we're olds, now) it was totally worth it!!!  The wine pairing sets this restaurant as my #1 meal of my lifetime booting Per Se to #2 (and I thought Per Se was out of this world!)  This restaurant is WORTH IT!!!

Eric was even able to get us a meet and greet with the uber talented chef!!  We got to thank him for our exquisite meal and explain that we were fans of his from his EMP days.  I am so happy that we were so lucky that evening!!!!!",0.0

"This is the most scary food experience I have ever had. My tale of filth is shocking but true. Even as I think about what just happened to me, I gag a little. Well, gulp, here we go:

""Bugs & Death Threats: a Culinary Experience at Crown""

It's Sunday, Week 2 of the football season. I am ready to pigout with some cold beer and some fried chicken with sides. Yum. I remembered that a new chicken place had opened up that offered delivery. They had slipped a menu under my door this week so I mistakenly decided to give them a whirl. The food looked standard and the prices were fair. I called for a delivery but they dont deliver despite what the menu said. Fine, I won't fault them, they just opened. The horror began when I picked up my order. First the place was slammed with ghetto people yelling and putting on a show. I'm used to this type of thing since I have lived around here for 6 years. But what caught my eye were the flies that were all over the place. I didn't think much till I got home...

When I got home, to my horror, I noticed  there were bugs all over my ""food"". Both flies and roaches. I literally got sick in the bag when I saw the abortion that was inside... Thank god I didn't take a bite or I would have fallen into a shock induced coma. The ""chicken"" was so swarmed with bugs that it looked like a prop from the film Beetlejuice.  Seriously, there were 4 or five visible bugs. I wish I took a picture but instinct kicked in and I ran the ""food"" to trash compactor before I thought to take a picture. 

Taste: So I can't comment on the taste of the food because I don't eat vermin for health reasons. But I assume that living bugs would provide a unique culinary experience. 

Nino provided awesome customer service to rectify the situation. First he cursed me out denying that he has ever seen a bug in the restaurant. Even as he yelled flies swarmed around the pizza like they do around the face of a starving third world child. (that was not PC but necessary)  Then he threatened my life if I was to post this on yelp. Me: ""get ready to be blasted on the net"" nino: ""I'll f*cking kill you if you post this"" me: ""are u gonna refund my money"" nino ""get the f*ck outta here before I kick your ass."" So i guess I am literally risking my life to pass this info along. (Your welcome yelp.) 

Don't worry concerned citizens of NYC, I've called 311. Hopefully they will shut this disaster down. BTW. Kissena diner just 2 doors away has been shut down because of bug/verman issues, so I am not suprised they are having this problem, but they just opened for godsake. The way they dealt with the situation was so unprofessional but may have been caused by the fact that half the people waiting for food canceled their orders as I recounted my experience and asked for a refund. Please if you love your family and do not want your little ones to get the bubonic plague. Don't eat here. Nothing positive to say.

I nominate this unique eatery as the filthiest restaurant in NYC. I would rather eat a shepards pie off the floor of the 1 train before I try their food. All kidding aside yelpers take caution.",0.0
"It's almost as if this place does not like to make money! I use to order from Quetzal quite frequently and stopped because their customer service is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! You would think that as much as we have ordered from them that their staff would treat us a little bit better. As a full-time grad student, full-time job and toddler I don't get a chance to cook single every day, so Quetzal was a great alternative (when we wanted Spanish food --their rotisserie chicken and their moro---delicious).  The last time my husband ordered from Quetzal was approximately 3 months ago, that day he ordered at least $40.00-$50.00 in Spanish food and because of the usual long wait he ordered two hours ahead of time and they STILL DROPPED THE BALL. After AN ALMOST two hour wait and numerous calls to the restaurant---being told the delivery is ""on his way"" and ""we are busy"" my husband canceled the order (I don't blame him).  As he was leaving for work he ran into the delivery guy, needless to say my husband refused the delivery and swore NEVER to order from this place again! That day my mother in law was watching my son and ended up having to order pizza! Being my optimistic self,  today I decided to give them a second chance in hopes that this restaurant has gotten it together I call to place an order. I asked the woman who answered if they had chicken noodle soup, I told her my husband and son are both home sick I wanted to have chicken soup sent to them---she placed me on hold for approx. 20 minutes . I tried calling back and there was not answer. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE AND I SEE NOTHING MUCH HAS CHANGED! It's REALLY sad because they have pretty decent food and we don't really have many Spanish go to restaurants in the neighborhood. Shame on you Quetzal, shame on you!!!!

"If I could give Amali zero stars I would.  I had a horrible experience with the restaurant.  I had a reservation with a cancellation policy in place and woke up extremely sick so needed to cancel.  I had to speak to multiple people including the owner and was told that I was going to be charged and was treated with no respect.  While the owner never charged my card, he did call me repeatedly over a short span and tried to threaten me.

"Ok,  at this point, I have tried coconut cronut twice, and figs mascarpone once.  I have tried DKA, madeline the s'more thingy with some coffee.  I have seen Dominique Ansel himself the last two times I was there.  There weren't that many people that recognized him, but I didn't want to bother him cause I was pretty sure he was already sick of all the attention he'd been getting.

Anyway, personally I liked cocout cronut much more than figs mascarpone.  Still the texture of cronut is one of a kind.  Then I grew my love for DKA.  I have visited this store after cronut hours (about noon) twice, and both times I ended up getting DKA.  I still haven't changed my mind that the cronut is definitely worth lining up for 3 hrs once in a while.",0.0
"I don't get excited about brunch like most other New Yorkers do - BUT, whenever I go to Cafe D'Alsace, it's an exception to the rule.

This is my favorite spot for brunch in NYC. I know this is a daring proclamation, but after a predictably indulgent weekend of eating, I absolutely love ordering a plate of their Eggs Niçoise, which is ratatouille with two poached eggs and melted gruyere on top. It's just the right mix of good with a little bid of bad to set things straight for the work week to come. 

Part of my distaste for brunch is that I'm sick of seeing nearly the same menu everywhere, but Cafe D'Alsace menu is vast and makes things a lot more interesting than the standard French bistro fare with some of its dishes clearly German influenced (hence, the region of Alsace). Don't care for a gruyere omelette? Perhaps a German pancake would interest you, or maybe a tarte flambee?

Whatever it is that's up your brunch alley, I'm sure Cafe D'Alsace has you covered. As for me, I've found a place for brunch that no longer makes me a slave to smoked salmon benedicts (although, they have that here, too). Yay!",0.0
"Perfectly adequate. One thumb up and I am enjoying my cheap sushi coma!

Just ordered for the first time after a serious sushi craving hit, but did not want the shame of a $55 personal sushi meal. The cheapo prices and vast menu sounded appealing, of course, and on this glorious long weekend I figured I could handle a little food poisoning so I went for it.

Salmon teriyaki + shumai combo came with an adorable side salad. The salmon was thin, but well-coated and tasty and the sauce soaked into the top of my brown rice just the way I like it. They gave enough salmon that I was impressed, thin or not. I'm sure some people might complain that it's a little overcooked but I actually love it this way. Shumai was totally typical for delivery, but not squishy-soggy so I'm gonna pop those babies in the microwave later and feel really proud of myself for the bargain. The salad dressing and shumai sauce came in those tiny cups and were also totally standard and good.

Pacific roll had 4-6 pieces (I ate them so fast I forgot to count), but not the stupid 1 inch cheapo kind, these babies were large and showy. I think it was made hastily because they weren't sealed properly, and fell apart in my soy sauce dip, but then I changed my technique and kept it together for most of it. The taste was great and I almost didn't mind that they FORGOT the wasabi dollop, which I've never experienced in my life. 

2 pieces tomago sushi were also normal, but somewhat thinly sliced. But for $1.25 each, fine! 

Lastly, they took about 30 or 35 min to arrive, not bad on a Saturday night. The delivery dude called me from outside my ground floor apt, oddly, and basically said ""ovtksibxosbw.....nxkcudks....kxif...wkdbdje"" to which I said ""I can't hear you, are you lost?"" And then he rang the bell. When he came to the door he had his phone wedged in his helmet and was still talking... just not to me. It was weird, and funny. 

Overall, for the price, this place is fine. Not mind-blowing, but hits the spot. I will definitely order again!",0.0
"I have to say, this place is quintessential New York and it is absolutely worth the hype. I have been wanting to try Katz's for quite some time, so when I was home
Visiting for the holidays it was the perfect time to go. I don't eat red meat or pork,
So the corned beef and pastrami were out for me. I had the turkey Reuben. And I honestly can't even describe just how delicious it was--the turkey was by far the best turkey I've ever had. It was
So juicy and not the least bit dry (as turkey can be), the bread was perfect rye, and the Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing that went on the sandwich just complimented it so well. The sandwich is humongous. I somehow are 3/4 of it and felt so full I was almost sick after-so I recommend eating half and splitting it with someone. My friends all got the pastrami Reuben and they had the sentiments about theirs that I had about mine.

"The place is always packed since there is no competition. My husband and son love the pizza.
Having eaten there 3 times, I would not go back because it is FILTHY. As I sat waiting on chairs that were tilting and table that had caked on food, I pulled out my wet wiped and started cleaning because I have a 5 year old who touches everything. As I carefully looked around I wanted to jump out of my skin. The entrance to the back kitchen had two large, disgusting yellow mop buckets covered in dirt with black water just sitting. Next to that is the bathroom which you only use if you must go. There was dust and some cobwebs along the wall. The ugly tiled floor was a hazard because it felt like there was oil spill because my feet were sliding. There were entrenched foot prints and what looked to be sticky stuff on the floor. All the workers were unkept in their attire and appearance and were shouting across the pizzeria to each other and swearing. 
I am certain if the health department were to visit the doors will be shut immediately. With the volume of clients , spending some effort in cleaning and maintaining would be in their best interest. My husband thinks the crust is delicious but it's not worth getting sick over. I will not be going back unless I see visible drastic improvements.",0.0
"After waking up feeling super sick today, I got my butt out of bed & headed straight to Juice Generation, seeking anything with antioxidants and vitamin C to help me feel better. 

I ordered the Citrus Super C juice (pineapple, grapefruit, orange, mint) and the XO Coco açai bowl (açai, banana, coconut oil, almond milk, strawberries, coconut shavings, hemp granola) from the counter. I also picked up a Vital Shot (ginger, lemon, cayenne pepper) from the fridge. 

The service was super quick and friendly. 

The Citrus Super C juice was super fresh and tasty --I feel as though I drank that thing in under 5 minutes. I highly recommend ordering this if you're suffering from a sore throat (as I was) or cold.

My favourite of the order was definitely the XO Coco açai bowl. Everything tasted super fresh and I felt as though I was eating a dessert, but it was healthy for me (who doesn't love that?!). This is my favourite açai I've had in NYC to date. I think this would be an excellent choice for anyone looking to satisfy a sweet tooth the healthy way. 

The Vital Shot, as I expected, is suuuuper strong and made my face pucker from a tiny sip. I definitely don't recommend giving this a try for kicks. Buy this if you're feeling congested or sleepy --it'll definitely give you a kick and clear up the sinuses! 

One thing to be aware of: like many other juice bars, there isn't really a spot to sit. I'd recommend grabbing your order then taking a walk to the nearby Central Park to enjoy.",0.0
"From outside to in it looks exactly like its neighboring, fast food, ""ethnic"" restaurant, Dos Toros.  But the moment you step inside it's the smell of chutney and cumin all the way.

I love spiced food, particularly anything Middle Eastern or Asian, so the concept of having a Pakistani meal done Dos Toros/Chipotle style intrigued me.  I have tried both the Chicken bowl and the Paneer (grilled goat cheese) options.  Both are delicious.  The toppings are great options, although it was a bit jarring to see the Pico de Gallo--er, I mean, chopped tomato--in a Pakistani spot.  Take the sauces, the hot one is pretty mild, I would've preferred more of a kick, which is why I'm glad they also provide minced chilis for the brave and bold.  Or in my case, the spice-deprived.

Downside is, along with a lot of these restaurants, the food is almost never at the temperature I want it to be.  It's always warm to lukewarm, but never piping hot.  In that sense, if you're expecting that, you're probably better off hitting the truck or going to a sit down.  But if you want a quick grab and go with some chutzpah, and you are sick of Chipotle, it's nice that you have an option.",0.0
"Sigh... Just one rat was found... Honestly the people there aren't stupid. Pests maybe filthy and everywhere but they are easily kept away by constant movements. Seeing how busy that shop is, the workers are constantly moving and thus I highly doubt their food is dirty. I've been going there a lot and I'm disappointed that it's temporarily closed. I know what bad food taste like; I've been to many stores and such yes it's common for people to make dumplings without gloves. Hell, I make my dumplings with my bare hands. it's faster and more efficient. I'd like to see all those people complaining make 100 dumplings under 10 minutes with their bare hands. And I've seen them constantly wash their hands... I mean what else is there to do when you're waiting for your food? If they were truly unsafe to eat at... More photos and complaints would've popped up before the gothatmist article. They literally make and cook the food RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU! It's not like they're hiding their cooking methods or their kitchen is in some obscure place. Their containers are clean. Rats and other rodents have weak control over their colon muscles and constantly leave droppings everywhere. I've never seen them have rat pop or roach poop in/on any of their containers and I've seen their workers constantly wipe down their counters and cooking areas. Plus where they cook their food is too hot to even attract a rat or two to poop on their food. They keep constant watch over their food too. I've never had burnt food from them but I've had sometimes slightly undercooked dough dumplings. The meat they use... It's definitely not old. I ate dumplings made from old meat and I know what they taste like. Sure the meat's not as good as their dough but the dumplings are still good. I adore their noodle soups.

They're actually not that cheap for dumplings. 4 for $1 whereas other places sell them 5 for $1. Chinatown is known for its cheap food. I don't know why they're getting slammed for selling their dumplings ""cheaply"" If we're going to be all economical about this... think about it... The 'SELLING PRICE'. There's so many restaurants in Chinatown. There's a ton of fried dumpling places, hell, there's another fried dumpling place on the same block. They have to make it or break it. Keep their prices low or their competitors will just trounce them. They'd have to give up the large profit margins that many American businesses thrive on. In fact if people sat down and looked up wholesale prices, they'd feel cheated. A good example would be: Apple iphone cases, if you brought it from a wholesale in China, each case is 10 cents and many of them are typically resold for more than $5. That's more 100% profit. 

Where I live, I once had a mice infestation and roach infestation but I still eat the food I made. Plus until I see a photo of a rat swimming in their dumpling meat or a roach dancing in their dough... I'm still going to eat there. Besides anyone who's ever had a mice/roach problem could EASILY tell if the food had rat droppings or other disgusting evidence of pests in their food.   

Back on their good points:

Their service is fast and EFFICIENT! I cannot stress how important it is to have my order taken without any mistakes and get my food fast. My Chinese is not that good but I can easily order without worries because they have a great number system that even non-Chinese speakers could use to order. Sure, the guy at the cashier isn't all sunshine and rainbows but you have to remember... He's been working there for NINE years and longer... Dealt with all kinds of customers and takes hundreds of orders everyday. No matter how much you order, I've never seen him make a mistake. He speaks English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. That's pretty skillful. 

Their food is 4.5/5! Simply because it is cheap and delicious. Sure the fried dumplings are not healthy but their noodles and other non fried food is good. Not too salty and not too greasy. They always have fresh ingredients. I never got food poisoning from them and I used to go there a lot. My sister is a huge fan of their dumplings. They don't charge you extra for using sauce which is very generous of them.",0.0
"The Google map on this Yelp page has this bar located in the water, off the ferry station, with a question mark.

Accurately describes where this bar belongs. 

I went on a Wednesday night after volunteering in the area, thinking, it's not even 9pm; surely we'll have the bar to ourselves and have us a good, pleasant night.

Or not.

The loudest, grossest douchebags lined the bar, way more intoxicated than socially acceptable for a Wednesday night. Therefore, they spoke and laughed way louder than necessary, so the bartendress had to turn up the music, which only made them louder, which only made it more difficult for everyone in the bar to hear each other talk. Then one yelled, ""Does anyone here have a condom? Size small, for my friend here!"" And of course, they all bellowed, and I wondered if they even liked each other as people. Probably not. 

I excused myself to the restroom, where I was greeted by vomit in the sink. And it wasn't fresh; it had dried up enough for me to know it'd be sitting there for a while. I looked up at the ceiling while I used the toilet to prevent myself from puking in response. Back downstairs, I told one of the bartendresses and she said she'd clean it up. Not sure if she did, since she had to get more rounds of shots for the douchebags. Hey, at least she made money for the night. 

I pray to Jesus that I never have to go back here. I certainly won't be recommending it to anyone.",0.0
"This Starbucks location is beyond disgusting. I had to make the horrible choice of using their bathroom and I would have vomited if I didn't think I would get an STD from getting too close to the toilet. I won't go in to details. 

After that initial experience, going to the counter and seeing the scraps of trash and sticky counters made it even worse. 

Luckily, a manager was at the register and when I expressed my displeasure with the state of their bathroom, he looked at me, said nothing, and then shouted to an employee (who was socializing with a friend) to clean it. Her response was ""I'm not cleaning no fucking bathroom"". Lovely.

I try to avoid Starbucks in general, but I really needed a coffee. I will never return here, even though my absence will cause no great hardship for the company. If I persuade even one person from going here, I consider it a job well done.",0.0
"I rarely get sick but when I do I break an elaborate arsenal, including soup!  After two days of chicken noodle soup I wanted something more interesting, and I found it at Boi.  I mean WOW.  The curry chicken meatball soup was phenomenal both in taste and for how it opened up my sinuses.

Turns out the disgusting black particles were ROACH FECES. I went back a few days ago to purchase meat and i saw a HUGE roach running along the counter where they CUT their meat.

"Went here after a really late movie on Valentine's Day. Got in about 3am. There was a wait outside in the freezing cold which I really didn't mind even though Lil Mama waltz in without a wait because she is a celeb I guess. 

It was crazy packed upstairs as we waited at the bar. The crowd was definitely trendy after the club. Me and my boyfriend was way under dressed but whatever. 

Wild berry margarita was decent. Ordered fish tacos which were pretty good. My boyfriend order the chicken and waffles. they were amazing Even at 3am the food was still really good. We were so tired that we could barely finish it. Going back for those chicken and waffles soon and to try the truffle fries.

"I love the meatball shop!! This was my second time to the LES location.  I had the chicken pesto on the brioche bread.  My group of friends also ordered a pitcher of white sangria.  The prices are super cheap.  My meatballs were amazing.  I could have easily gone for a second sandwich just to taste the pesto sauce again.  The service was really nice and the food came out quickly.  The service was super accommodating even though I came with a group of 8 people.
I don't normally comment on other reviewers and their opinions, but I need to address the smell of the restaurant.  It did smell a little funky, like someone was sick to their stomach.  However, I really do believe that that is the smell of cheese in the summer.  The smell wasn't too strong, where I was nauseated or anything, and I am super sensitive to smell.  I didn't smell anything until way after we ate.  It didn't bother me, but I could see how others might mind it.  
Nonetheless, I can't wait to come back for more meatballs!",0.0
"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were promptly seating inside. Our waitress was less then pleased to even we walking the earth, let alone take our order. Our water glasses smelled of wet dog and literally made me sick to my stomach. I asked for another and was greeted with attitude. 

I ordered the Kale and Pear salad which was okay, the pears came out of a can and clearly were not fresh..you can get some fresh fruit. My fiancé got the Nova and it was okay. He didn't care for the home fries and thought they could be crispier. Overall, we didn't love our experience and won't be coming back here for brunch... EVER",0.0
"I understand a lot of folks love meat.  Meat, meat, meat, bacon, ribs, chicken, spam, spam, spam... Seriously, great if you're a meat eater.  Come here.  Most of my family is, that's why I came. But... Its not that hard to offer a token veggie burger alongside the beef burgers  Why would they not want that extra income?  I've asked a few times.  It ain't happening here.  Here, meat is a religion and anything not meat a sacrilege.  

OK.  My ""food"" just arrived - grilled cheese sandwich, onion rings and pink lemonade.  The ""lemonade"" was country-time!  (Confirmed). Still feel sick from the chemical taste of that.  How hard is it to make real lemonade?  The onion rings had been made long ago and were cold.  

The sandwich was made with that cheese that sits in a vat at the movie theatre from which they make nachos. 

Although we ordered a cheddar grilled cheese sandwich on whole wheat, I got an American ""cheese"" sandwich on white - not particularly grilled.  My companion ordered a burger on whole wheat.  She got a white bread bun.  Pretty bad Cole slaw + no fork with which to eat it.

Worst meal of 2014, if not the decade so far.  Feel a little nauseous.  

This place shouts either ""I don't care!"" Or Tax shelter created to fail.

These owners seem to have no pride or self respect.  Avoid.  Avoid.",0.0
"What a disaster, I don't even know where to start!
Menu - so simple yet so confusing. It states Veg=vegetarian - may include dairy or POULTRY. Umm, what?!? When asked - per chef in some cultures vegetarians eat chicken. With that said, turkey burger = vegetarian.
Latkes - if you know what a latkes is - skip it here. 4 latkes the size of maybe silver dollar, soggy - almost tasted microwaved. I dare say frozen Trader Joes are better than these!
Wine - I don't know who's great idea it was to serve wine in water glasses. Not only you not letting the wine breathe properly but you're taking away the enjoyment of having a glass of wine!
Entrée - here is the fun:
1.Steak - was overwhelmingly over seasoned and over cooked. It was returned and redo was much better but still pretty chewy.
2.Burger - as few mentioned - it was more like burger tar tar! It was returned; to make things worse they took the same patty and re-grilled it which at that point was overcooked w/burned cheese. That's a #1 no no - don't use same food! Person who ate this was pretty sick the following hour.
3.Salmon - was the only dish not returned at the table.
4.Mash Potatoes - for starters - not exactly mashed! No seasoning at all.
In a good restaurant when 2 out of 3 entrees are returned something needs to be done to make it right with the customer. Have the manager come over, offer drink on the house, nothing! Overall, even the dining atmosphere is not nice. The chef stands barking out orders and his displeasure of how things are almost belittling the staff. Not only is it very unprofessional but it makes for one unpleasant dining experience! This may be from the same team as Rusty Mackerel but it doesn't even come close! Advise to owners - rehire head waiter Jason back and have him train the staff and maybe teach the chef some manners. While rusty was not perfect, we always came back just for the service! 
Safe to say, will not be returning unless there is some drastic improvement.",0.0
"My brother (who I'm writing this for since he doesn't have a Yelp account) tried to place an order over the phone with this place today (7/21/15) and was told by the attitude-filled phone order taker that she ""prefers"" taking credit card orders via Seamless over taking them over the phone.

Btw their Super Vegetarian Burrito is hardly Super, Vegetarian, or a Burrito unless you like diarrhea looking beans, way too much sour cream to mask the sliminess of them, uncooked tortilla bread, dirty lettuce, watery tomato chunks (all five of them), no salsa, and barely any green sauce or guacamole. Their too small cup of Chili Colorado is a whopping $5.95 for maybe three strips of beef and way too much sauce and rice. I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt after previous rude service but I'm finally done with them. Rename this place Pupe's (Poope's.)""",0.0
"Just had lunch.

I went around 12 and finished around 1pm. I suggest you go early because there's not much left after I leave. They don't refill as frequently as they would during dinner. Overall, I ordered orange juice, and the total is $28 including tips.

I like to eat alone, so unlike many other places, they didn't treat me awkwardly. Anyway, it's buffet, so there isn't much of ""service"".

About the food: I mainly went there for the hot food. Although the food is fresh, it lacks somewhat favor. It's decent food, but just doesn't wow you. In fact, I got sick tired of it after second round.

But they did have steak! Medium rare! 

By the way, the waiter was very polite. In conclusion, it was more worthy than my Fridays' $40 lunch the other day. I would definitely go back, but probably in 3 month.",0.0
"I was looking for a new bubble tea store other than Coco since they don't have fruit flavors mixed with the milk like Strawberry. And I then found Juicy Cube nearby. 

They have an easy to read menu with several fruit flavor options in addition to the other teas and fruit drinks they offer and I ask for a Taro Bubble tea.  I sat down on a long window seat that they have against the window and on one side of the wall.

The guy who made the tea called it out and I then got up to retriever it.  They do not bother to give you a straw so you have to grab your own. The Taro  I had a nice purple color to it and I promptly took it back to my office and placed it on my desk and I sat down and began to put my straw in when I was hit with BUBBLE TEA DISASTER. 

The tea cup exploded and collapse with 75% percent of tea went on my clothes.  I was a sticky purple taro boy mess.  But wait I didn't get to taste it and there was still some with pearl in what was left of the cup.

Unfortunately the first slip I took a pearl got stuck in the straw before I could get a taste.  That already two bad omens and I was not going for three like food poisoning, so I toss what was left of the tea in the trash.

Maybe my straw stabbing technique needs improvement but I can still say that Juicy Cube uses thin wall cheap cups and dull pointed straws what did they say 10 cents on 20 cups by getting the thin one, I got a 20 dollar laundry bill.",0.0
"I remember a time when Applebee's used to have good, hearty food. Unfortunately, these days, it seems to just keep getting worse and worse. They seem to be cutting more and more corners with the quality of their food. Now, it may just be this particular Applebee's or all of them. I'm not really sure which since I haven't gone to Applebee's in a very long time, and I dared venture to this particular one last Sunday. So I'd like to stress that this review is only for this particular Applebee's and not all of them.

The only things that went well in this meal were the appetizers, the drinks, and the waitress (she was on point, very helpful, and very pleasant). Other than that, the meal basically put me off eating at Aplebee's for a considerable amount of time going forward, maybe even for good.

Our appetizers were stock. We had the pretzel sticks with the beer cheese sauce, and an order of the appetizer sampler. Like I said, this was the part of the meal that went well. Everything was good and was pretty much exactly what we were looking for. What came after, however, just left a bad taste in my mouth, both figuratively and literally, and actually almost made me sick. 

I ordered the NY strip steak. It looked great from the picture in the menu, and I eat it at Friday's all the time. I always thought Friday's and Applebee's were similar so I decided to go for it. The steak at Friday's is pretty good, after all. Boy, was I mistaken. I'm not even sure that whatever came out to the table was even beef. It looked like a severely undercooked steak (it was gray, not brown or black like a well-done steak should be), but when I cut a piece and put it into my mouth, it tasted and felt like someone ground up a bunch of pork, and pounded it into the shape of a steak. It actually tasted closer to pork sausage than actual beef, and it had the exact same texture and consistency too. I couldn't finish it. Took one bite, and put my fork down. I don't know if it was old or something, but a beef steak should feel and taste like well-cooked beef when you put it in your mouth, not processed, ground up Canadian bacon. It should be tender and juicy, not gamy. And did I mention it should taste like cow? Yeah, that one's important.

Can't say I'll be going there again anytime soon. Maybe not even ever again. I've been disappointed by Applebee's before and I think this might have been the last straw. I think I'll stick to Friday's when it comes to standard Americana food. Sorry Applebee's, but you have some serious work to do.",0.0
"The last time I came here I was sick for two days after. That was 6 months ago, and, well, I was willing to say maybe that was just a one time thing.

After work I stopped by to ask for my money back and they we total jerks about it. I even showed them the raw chicken and the owner said ""Oh you should have asked for well-done."" WTF? When I got mad the woman behind the counter started yelling at me and told me to ""be nice."" It's really hard to be nice to a-holes!

"OMG this place needs to be shut down for animal cruelty. This feels like a 3rd World petting zoo and its sickening to me. I think the part that really upset me was the little shed they have set up and inside it has some lizards and most upsetting is a big tortoise. The Tortoise is practically the same size as the box he is in and he can barely move around. The lizards were crawling all over the clamp lights and electrical cords and a kid could easily just grab one. There was no staff member inside keeping watch. The bunnies outside looked depressed and are just in a box. It seems that they could at least try to provide some sort of a natural looking habitat for these poor animals. I was actually sick to my stomach when we were here and I wanted to pull my 2 year old out as fast as possible. The worst part is that kids that are young enough to not know that this is animal cruelty would love being free to pick up, poke, pet, and play with these unhappy animals......this is turn gets ignorant parents to bring their children back and keep giving this place money to stay open!

I'm a loyal Benny Burritos supporter from back when I was in college. This place always offers great Mexican food that's consistent and amazing. Their margaritas pack a punch and they have a pretty sick happy hour deal that's worth checking out. They recently expanded the bar area and it makes a huge difference. One of my only complaints prior to the construction was that the bar was always felt too cramped and crowded. Now the space is open and airy. I highly recommend the shrimp quesadilla and their chicken fajita burritos are also a must try! They also have a great brunch menu.,0.0

"Disclaimer: I'm not a vegan, nor am I a vegetarian. If you are either of those, you should probably take my review with a grain of salt.

I came here with one of my best friends who happens to be vegan. He's a big fan of M.O.B. as it's hard to find a quality vegan burger these days. He typically orders the Mob Burger Deluxe, which he loves and continues to rave about. I probably should have ordered that, but instead went for the Mob Dog Deluxe mostly out of curiosity and fascination with the ingredients list.

The Mob Dog is made with spiced carrot, mushroom and chickpeas, and topped with mustard, ketchup, sauerkraut, and relish, all inside of a sweet potato roll. It sounded pretty good! I ordered it with a salad. The salad was nice; red and purple greens lightly dressed. The dog looked cool. The taste, however, yikes. The first couple bites reminded me of the outside breading of a corn dog. Not bad, necessarily, just odd. The texture was kind of mushy and bread-y. The further I got into it, the more I felt like I was eating cardboard. The bun was way too thick for the dog. I got sick of it about 2/3 in and couldn't finish it. 

Another disclaimer: I like real hot dogs. I'm slightly ashamed to admit it since God only knows what goes into a typical hot dog link. However, I've grown to love that flavor and texture and don't appreciate mushy cardboard-y versions (even though the ingredients of the Mob Dog were surely healthier!).

The decor is weird, but I dug it. The service was slow. There were only 3 small parties when I came, yet we had to wait 10 minutes for them to pick my credit card up after dropping the bill. 

If my friend takes me to M.O.B. again, I'm having the burger.",0.0

I ordered the Lamb Masala and gulab jamun for dessert, while  my friends got the chicken curry with garlic naan and banana fritters respectively. Both the gulab jamun and banana fritters were very good. But my friend and I personally found our main courses a bit underwhelming in flavor. The portioning was also a little questionable, though we did end up full from the bread that they offered us beforehand and the mango icecream they offered afterwards. Overall, you'll definitely find better deals for Indian food around NYC, hell, even on 6th street. This place isn't horrible, but yeah, you can do better.",0.0

"I don't normally write reviews for places but I just had to give my two cents for this fairly new spot in the East Village!

An old girlfriend and I were looking for a nice spot to grab dinner and catch up after not seeing each other for a year. I had saved this spot on Yelp as a place I'd take my boyfriend, but since we were in the area I figured we'd give it a shot. When we walked in, we were greeted by the host (bartender?) and he asked us whether we would like to be seated near the bar, on the ground floor, or upstairs. I heard great things about the balcony seating area so we headed upstairs and were handed off to another waitress to seat us. She gave us many options to sit and we chose to sit outside on the balcony, which was surprising warm even on a cold winter night! There are also seating options inside near the fireplace which was a great touch! 

Our waitress then promptly gave us menus and asked us for our preferred water (tap, sparkling, and still? There was a third choice but I forgot it). My friend and I skipped out on alcohol tonight because we both were a bit sick, but I'd love to come back to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner again. The drink menu looked like it had good options and I can't wait to come back to try. As for the food, the menu offers such a variety. We decided to start off with the escargot and a fried seafood mix which were both pretty good! They promptly gave us bread and butter right after we ordered our meal and service was great. The waiters were very attentive and came frequently to refill our glasses with water whenever they saw the glass close to empty. I never had any experience eating escargot, but it was nice and garlicky and I enjoyed it. The fried seafood mix was also yummy but next time I'd opt for something different. 

For our main meal, we ordered the special (pan seared scallops with couscous) and the steak frites. The scallops were a bit salty but it played well with the couscous. The steak was heavenly and it was a great portion. The two of us managed to clear our plates and were definitely full by the time we finished our meal. I had gotten up midway to go to the bathroom and returned to find my napkin neatly folded which was so sweet and charming. By the time we finished our meal, our waitress promptly cleared our tables and handed us the dessert menu. Because we already had something sweet earlier, we decided to skip out but their options sounded yummy as well! Their prices on all menus were very reasonable and I cannot wait to come back again. All in all, a great spot for something intimate, good food, and a good time!",0.0

I was looking forward to having a Mojito, which always came with lots of mint, lots of lime and a sugarcane sick, was watered-down, had barely any mint,  and no sugarcane. What a disappointment. Chocolate pina coladas are no longer on their menu. Their portions have gotten smaller and my favorite taco dish went from three tacos to two tacos and we're beyond tiny.
Our waitress was very nice and kind. She explain to us the changes on the menu. If you go get the nachos! Hopefully they won't change those.",0.0

My face hurts but i love it.

Annette gives me extra special peppers too take home to my ""dad i can eat anything"" challenge.

Service second to none.  Proprietary and rightfully so.

Nice diversion in the Kew Gardens area of Queens.  My Turkish friend confirmed the meticulous authenticity.

I just have to say this was my first time ordering and having something sent using edible arrangements and it was the best decision. I was a Lil nervous at first using the service but when I spoke to Xaviera from the Forest Hill location she put my mind at ease. I had an arrangement sent to a sick friend in the hospital and she had assured me that it would be extra special and it would be delivered on time. Which it was. I would definitely use their services again just because of her.,0.0
"Classy place in midtown that requires long pants even on a Wednesday night. 

I like this place because they don't discriminate and almost everyone in who abides by the dress code. This place has two levels - rooftop and lounge. Both are equally good and it really depends on what you want to do - enjoy the night view or talk with you friends. They have crowd control on the rooftop so they stop letting people in at around 1am. The rooftop is nice but quiet small. There is a good view of the Empire State Building and other skyscrapers. 

The drinks are good. I have had the coco, the Cosmo, dark and stormy and the Fort Knox. The coco and the Cosmo were delicious and strong ( it's a hard balance to strike but they did a good job!) 

Fort Knox is a a bourbon based drink - not my go to but my friend found it good. 

Dark and stormy is gin based with ginger. However the ginger taste is pretty overwhelming so it kind of tasted like something you drink when you're sick. 

Overall this place is nice. It's becoming a go to place for me in midtown.",0.0
"Of course leave it to me to get sick right before fashion week.  Today is the first day I'm not completely on bedrest so wanted to get the latest's fashionplate up while playing catch up.  Stay tuned for some revised fashion week news from Tasch in the next few days too!  As we all know I love my friend chicken, so on a cold afternoon before I got uber sick I decided to catch up with a friend at the newest outpost of Pies&Thighs on Canal Street.  The space is a super cute and tiny lunch counter.  I'm basically a mini me at 5'1? so I'm not sure how larger people eat here comfortably, but whatevs I was comfy in my little booth.  I decided to get the fried chicken box with cheese grits.  The fried chicken was juicy and tender and came with 3 pieces of chicken, an amazing biscuit and the cheese grits were just okay I would try the mac&cheese next time.  My friend the chicken biscuit which was also super delish.

"For my first father's day, we decided to try out a new place in our neighbourhood.  The menu looked good, so we called for an 18.45 reservation.  They told us it was a quiet night, everyone must be out barbecueing, and it wasn't a problem at all.  Great!

We get there and decide to share a bunch of starters and a mains.  The starters come out one by one, and they're all decent to good - scallops crudo, setas (mushrooms) and papa rotas.

This is where things take a detour.  Twenty minutes after clearing all our starters, the waiter informs us that the cheeks needed for the carbonara are not available.  Not sure why it took them that long to tell us, and that's where he leaves it hanging too - no suggestions or alternatives.  So I ask the waiter, ""do you have anything to substitute the cheeks with, like, I don't know, pancetta?"" He says ""I will ask"", and goes back to the kitchen.

Another twenty minutes pass, and he comes back.  There is no pancetta either.  Again, no follow-up.  I could ask if they have plain bacon, but we look at each other and decide that we want to move on.  Do we want to take a look at desserts? We're both on the fence, but decide to give it a go.

At this time, our baby boy (it's my first father's day, remember) has woken up a few times and gone back to sleep.  We order the cremoso de chocolate.  I think you can guess by now what happens next...

The waiter comes back after a good twenty minutes and informs us that, unfortunately, they ran out of cremoso de chocolate, but they still have everything else! It was a crazy weekend, sorry about that.  We should have known to give up at this point (three strikes in a row on things we ordered from their menu!), but against better judgement we order the pecan pie.

Another twenty minutes pass by.  A pregnant waitress walks by and asks us if we're waiting for anything.  We ask for the bill, and tell her that we're giving up on the pecan pie.  She's apologetic, and says that, while this is by no means an excuse, they had someone cancel last minute to wait tables.  That explains what's going on with our waiter at least.

Two minutes later, a pecan pie arrives, which was on the house at this point, so that certainly earned them a star back.  But sixty minutes of waiting on 4 different orders, only one of which finally makes it to the table? That's a bit rich.

As I write this, I am reading in the sidebar here that this place is from chef Fernando Navas, and that he previously worked at El Bulli in Spain (Rosas, Catalunya).  Ferran Adria would at the very least have run a tighter ship in his place.

Nevertheless, while I didn't have the stomach for it today, I do intend to go back for the beef cuts that sound really good, and I hope to up the ratings when I do so.  Maybe this was a one time fluke because the normal Sunday waiter got sick and cancelled...

(Oh, one final note - we don't need restaurants that play a full Bob Marley CD.  I've never owned one, but I feel like I know all his songs by heart.  If you're going for no personality at all in the music, at least mix it up)",0.0
"It always shocks me how few places are open on Christmas Day. After several straight days in your home with your whole family, doesn't everyone get sick of cooking and being indoors? After calling around to a bunch of Italian restaurants, I was happy to find that Forlini's was open and made a reservation a couple of days before. 

This place is old school. Like, real old school with the vinyl booth seats, random oil pantings on the wall, dark wood... you get the idea. Some of the booths have plaques bearing the names of local figures like cops and district attorneys. Pretty interesting! 

I was happy to find that we may have been the only non-Italian-American party at the table. We requested to sit in the back room because the lighting wasn't quite as harsh, and we shared the space with a large and boisterous family doing their Christmas celebration, which added to the festive atmosphere. 

Though the host and manager were beyond nice, our waiter seemed pretty pissed the whole time. Like I would ask for something and he wouldn't show any sign of acknowledgement, but eventually he'd bring me the stuff I was asking for. It was also really hard to get a recommendation out of him, but he nodded slightly when I asked if the lasagna was good. It was HUGE, I'll tell you that, but it was kind of a big mush of mostly melted cheese. Luckily I happen to love melted cheese so this was A-OK with me, but typically I enjoy a lasagna that has a little bit more shape and variety to it. 

My husband ordered the linguine in clam sauce, an old-school favorite that I think depends fully on the quality of the ingredients. There were a ton of clams on the dish, and the dish was enormous, and the sauce was tasty, though it seemed like they used canned clams. 

All in all, though the dishes weren't the absolute best I've ever had, I really enjoyed the retro ambiance and just feeling like I was witnessing a part of Little Italy's colorful history. That plus a big ol' plate of melted cheese left me happy, so I'm a fan!",0.0
"OMG I cannot believe this!  I order from Oxford several times a week as do many of my co-workers. The other day someone answered the phone and took my order. I even confirmed it.  I ordered 3 things and each thing was wrong - right down to the soda!!!  

I called that afternoon and a man answered that spoke no english oter than: No manager here today. When I finally called again to let the manager know 2 days later (I was out in between) he accused me of trying to get a FREE MEAL!!!  He made every excuse he could think of: someone had a sick baby, we were busy, you should have spoken more clearly, etc.  Never once did he say ""I am so sorry. What can we do to keep you as a customer?"".  

I am no longer patronizing this or any other Oxford cafe and will be informing their corporate of this situation.  This guy is an asshole and needs to learn the phrase: The customer is always right.",0.0
This is the second time I have been to this location rather than my usual Park Avenue visit. first time I went here I ended up getting food poisoning. Today I went there to get a vegetarian burrito bowl didn't ask for much rice but wanted more lettuce. the girl put one handful and I requested more making a statement that I hardly have anything in there because I asked for very little rice.. So then she puts 3 or 4 handfuls being sarcastic maybe and there was a black skinny girl next to her starts making comments to me.. For what reason not sure but she wasn't serving me nor ringing me up so she had no reason to.. Saying that that's a lot of lettuce etc... So I politely explain to her why I requested more lettuce and she still yapping on I told her to mind her business gave my credit card and kept it moving. as pricey as they are they can afford one or two handfuls extra of lettuce. Called and spoke with the manager Hank or Chang who pretty much tells me I should have ordered a salad instead of telling me that his staff was wrong for arguing with a customer who has many options on Austin Street. At the end of the conversation he was understanding to my special request and offer to comp next order but that wasn't the point of my call. definitely prefer the ones in Long Island and Park Avenue more than this one..,0.0

"Not impressed. This is what everyone is raving about? There is no flavor in the rice, just coloring.  Chicken is plain stewed chicken...as in boiled until it nearly falls off the bone then pulled/mashed and placed in the oven with lots of chicken stock.  Stock is made from days of boiling chicken.  Salad is dry.  Basically, it's all in the sauce which is beaten cheap light mayo (not even Hellman's) with pepper.

It doesn't taste better than the average halal truck in NYC but it does taste cleaner and you don't have to worry about getting sick since their chicken and rice is not greasy.  However all that mayo makes up on the oil factor and is gross.  I would say this is Americanized Halal.",0.0

I was lying in bed all day sick with the flu, and decided to try this place my friend recommended. After a few clicks on my seamless app, the food literally came within 30 minutes. I was impressed. 

I ordered the medium-spiced chicken tikki masala as well as an order of garlic naan. It came with a small container of rice, and sauces that I wasn't too crazy about. The masala was so flavorful, tender, and delicious. And spicy! I was pretty much crying out of happiness. I enjoyed dipping the garlic naan into the masala sauce. Yum.

The portion was so large for me I had to save the rest for another day. Even after a few days, it's still just as good.

"Master of seafood and worldwide flavors. The most impressive thing for me is actually the dessert!!! 

The amusements: lobster with sweet pea puree, some fresh fish, gazpacho.. fresh to start the night

The chef's tasting menu:

TUNA (**+)- the presentation is beautiful. As the first course, it is light. the ham chutney is crispy. 

KING FISH - CAVIAR (***) - This is absolutely awesome! my favorite. No wonder it is popular among yelpers. The light mariniere broth is warm, but it doesn't kill the taste of ""sashimi"" and caviar. 

LANGOUSTINE (***) - my friend loves it so much. It is ""medium rare"" roasted and the flesh just melts when you have it. 

LOBSTER(*) - inspired by Thai?? Personally, when I see a sauce similar to the orange sauce from a Chinese restaurant, I feel sick. I am full right after finishing half lobster tail.  

MONKFISH (*+) - not very impressive. The fish is good, but the paprika sauce is too heavy compared with others. 

WHITE TUNA - KOBE BEEF (**) - inspired by Korean, I believe. The Kobe beef tastes like Korean BBQ. I would prefer a simple flavored one with salt or something. White tuna is soft and the sauce is great. It is a seafood restaurant, so don't be surprised that the meat is of average. 

MATCHA (****) - Probably it is the best matcha dessert I have had so far.  However, it is within my expectation that green tea custard should have bitterness.  

BLUEBERRY (*****) - The matcha one is expected, then this one is totally beyond my expectation. PURE taste of blueberry, the marinated one and the sorbet under the frozen sweet corn meringue. The ""golden"" ones are beautiful. Pictures just cannot show its beauty. Even it is frozen, it doesn't shock your stomach with coldness. 

It deserves 3 stars. If I can make another reservation, I will definitely come back for other courses.",0.0
"Let me preface this by saying I rarely enter McDonald's but I was really hungry this morning and I wanted a breakfast sandwich! 

This place is a real eyesore!  Therefore I'm so disappointed in myself for staying the course to order from this establishment. But nonetheless, I did....  Between the addicts and the mentally ill people that hang out here, it really makes it hard to wait around for your order.  Ooh and the wait is painstakingly long!  I couldn't understand why especially since it's just breakfast food, then after I ordered I saw why...

There must be a serious disconnect between the information inputted in the computer and what one sees on the screen. I ordered an egg whites and cheese on a biscuit with an iced latte with skim milk.

What I received... A hot coffee with a whole eggs and cheese on a biscuit.  I had to have them correct my order twice, then I have to beg for condiments. REALLY!!!  Total time invested at this establishment for two items, 19 minutes.

The worst part was the fact that the coffee is GROSS and had a powdery taste.

"The Bad
- Tables are really close together so no privacy
- Free jello shot for fellow yelpers is a good thing but the shot wasn't strong or flavorful

The Good
- Ok, salad bar....this probably got me full...love DIY salad bars (comes with chef's sashimi entree)
- Sashimi's tasted fresh but I kinda got sick of eating raw after 4-5 pieces
- Free green tea (but you have to ask for it)
- Hot/warm towel before you eat
- Lots of drink specials (cocktails and sake buy 1 get 1 free or something like that)
- Spicy Girl Roll-- I can see why everyone got this; spicy, crunchy, what's there not to like
- Cloud 9 Roll-- similar to spicy girl roll but hands down to spicy girl roll over this

The Bottomline: Probably won't come back again but if I do, I'll definitely get something with a salad bar option. Take a look at my salad creation! Hehe, money well spent.",0.0
"I've been to this location twice, once for my friends private event and once for my birthday. Didn't mind too much at my friends party about the service and atmosphere but I didn't remember what I really even ate there... I just liked the setting and interior of the restaurant so I decided I'd give it a chance and celebrate my birthday here. 

The food wasn't all that great, it was okay. I had sushi rolls but they didn't seem to be anything crazy nor did it seem like they were made professionally like how other sushi restaurants do. I had a party of 12 and the waitress/waiters we had wasn't the super friendly kind. They just seemed alright. Since it was my birthday I ordered a sangria and it was pretty good, the manager even gave my table free shots on the house which was super nice of him. Probably the only awesome thing that happened there.

What really bummed me out towards the end of my visit was that when me and my friends made our way to the bar after paying for our meals was that i had totally forgotten about a couple of my birthday gifts under the table. However, I didn't realize till about 10 minutes after we had all left the restaurant. I went back to the restaurant to ask the waitresses/waiters if they had seen them but they all said no. Funny thing was, that my table was empty and everything was cleaned up quick and no customers had came in to eat after my group had left. How SUS is that?! & when my bf described to them what was left, one of the waitresses said she had saw them but because she wasn't taking care of our table, she did not happen to care to pick up my gifts. Wow. They also told me i should call the next day to talk to the manager about lost and found items but the manager left already for the day....I left my number in hopes that they would find it but I highly doubt it from the answers I got. 

It just makes me sick to my stomach that the employees there would be so cold hearted not to give back somebody else's birthday presents that were from family members and friends. Way to ruin my night. Will definitely not be coming back.

The only things you'll have to deal with are slow service and check-in deals that don't work.

"Aki gets three and a half stars and the half star bump up because, it is what it is.

Aki is a discount sushi place with decent sushi.

There is a lot of competition on the block for sushi.  Aki is the clear price winner, hands down, blind folded.

There is no pretentious anything at Aki.  They have a menu.  They are well decorated and clean.  They half half price sushi.  They will take your order then leave you to whatever it is you do besides eat.  The rolls are really well priced.

Every salmon combination I have tried is good, including the New York roll with apple and mayo.

If you are looking to impress someone, there are places with nicer decor on the block.  If you want to eat, not break the bank and get a pretty no frills, cheap experience, without worrying about getting sick or having gas station like sushi, Aki wins hands down.

I went with a watermelon salad and their pasta, and both were sick!  The bartender was super attentive and conversational, letting me taste a bunch of beers even though it was busy.

"My family and I like this place a lot. Our problem is not with the place but with some of the clientele: the loud, spoiled children and their clueless parents who have a great sense of entitlement. I completely understand that this is a family joint and there could be occasional crying and tantrums, though ONLY from small children. And I get that it's not a fancy place, by any means. But what about people like us who just want to enjoy the pizza without being harassed by loud families? 
When we ate dinner there tonight, this kid vomited at the table next to us and the parents did not even apologize to us for the grossness and the foul smell. Then, after the waiter cleaned up their mess, they continued to sit there with their wine and their pizza. A right thinking parent would have taken the sick kid home or outside! How inconsiderate! This is just one example of what I'm talking about. We have come here MANY times and have witnessed inconsiderate families behave badly each time.
I immediately asked for our check and for the rest of our pizza to be wrapped up so we can just enjoy it at home.
Other than that, pizza is okay here.",0.0

We ordered two types of prosciutto and they were both to die for.  I had a glass of white and my boyfriend had a glass of red, both really good!

It's definitely a cute date spot! Like I said it has great ambience because it's very small and cozy. Casa Mono which is right next door opened up Bar Jamon so their guests can grab a small bite and a glass of wine while waiting for their seats at Casa Mono!",0.0
"I hate to write a bad review of Clementine, because in general it is a great place. I have loved the gluten-free baked goods I've bought there in the past, but today I had the absolute worst service. I called ahead to check if there were any gluten-free bread loaves in stock. I was told they were available and I did not need to reserve one. When I got there I was sold a delicious looking loaf, but it looked almost suspiciously ""too delicious"" to be gluten free. It was in fact a regular wheat bread loaf complete with gluten. I am gluten intolerant and would have been very sick if I had eaten the bread sold to me. When I returned the loaf, the woman at the cash register sarcastically snipped, ""Well it would have sucked to have the wrong kind of bread, I guess."" For a place that advertises itself as a gluten free and vegan specializing bakery, that's pretty insensitive to people with severe gluten allergies and celiac. And after all of this the woman went upstairs to check stock, the basement to check and finally reported they in fact had no gluten free bread whatsoever. And! I missed the bus while waiting for all of this. What a bummer. Clementine, wanna reserve me a complimentarily gluten free loaf and I'll give you guys another shot?",0.0

"The worst restaurant I have ever been to in this area. Avoid at any cost. Bad bad bad bad bad .........
My sister threw her annual party at this place, and we ordered tons of dishes. None of dishes we ordered were edible especially a beef stir fired dish. The quality and taste of the meat tasted like chemical. Because of this dish was left  untouched, I told the waitress the problem. She said she would have the chef to taste it and let us know if there's any problem with this dish. She took the plate and came right back out. She said both of them tasted the dish and they think there's nothing wrong with it. We were just trying to give them our honest opinion because we live in the neighborhood. We really want to have a restaurant that we can order from everyday. 
Everything, absolutely everything in this restaurant is bad particularly foods. Nothing is fresh here.  This is the only restaurant that I would never ever go back for the rest of my life.

"Made My Family Sick
We went into tonight to put an order in for dinner. My daughter and I have celiac. We asked to see their gluten-free menu -- which they have. (and there was a lot of attitude from them in asking for the menu.) We ordered shrimp salad rolls, made it clear because they were gluten free to the waitress. Even talked about how we needed it without sauce. When we got home and started eating it we realized we were eating something fried. I called, upset and the woman at the restaurant said: ""I don't have a diet like yours. How am I supposed to know?"" I said: These aren't shrimp rolls though. She said, ""No their catfish, and fried."" We live five blocks away. I will never go again. It's one thing to be wrong. But attitude and wrong? Forget it.

The owner comes out to say hi and thank you--I mean, what more could you ask for? I like my wine and even the wine list is superb!! Thanks for the memories as this is the place to celebrate major life events!! But we also come here when we are hungry!! Hahahaha-Lol  Hubby raves about the carrot cake. He is gluten sensitive, and never gets sick when we eat here. My daughter loves the ravioli and her boyfriend loves the ""regular"" dishes as well!!

They have a rule that you can't have more than 2 bottles of wine to prevent people from getting drunk and starting something. 

I had the breaded chicken cutlet (an outrageous $18 but worth it). It was fantastic! Just great! For desert, I had chocolate ice cream (no sprinkles, WHY?!) and it was HORRIBLE XP. It was engulfed with freezer burn. Just bad 

The service was awful. You can tell ALMOST every employee hates their job and wishes for their shift to end. The hostess was nasty and rude. Like we were wasting her precious time.

The ambiance was very french, and the service was excellent as well. Considering how busy it was, Friday during dinner time, I was amazed by how excellent we were treated by the staff, and how quickly we were seated.

As for the food, I probably did not choose the best time to come to such a nice restaurant. I was very sick and on antibiotics at the time. I ordered the Coq Au Vin, and after not being able to taste anything for weeks due to the sickness, I all of sudden got taste of the delicious entrée I had in front of me. For that reason, I give Balthazar Restaurant 5/5 stars. The food is explicit!

It's kinda isolated so you have to look for it, but once inside it opens up to a pretty decent looking place with a nice relaxing ambiance, and what appears to be outside dinning for the nice weather to come. This spot offers fresh made to order pizza with a real brick oven!!! The staff was friendly and attentive and the pizza was ok and I say ok because the crust was kinda soft which caused the pizza to kinda fall over when trying to fold in half, the pizza had really good flavor, although the habanero really wasn't hot at all.... The waiter was so attentive that the second our glass of water was a quarter way done he filled it up again.. Rest assure you won't get thirsty here lol all in all a nice spot.

"PATHETIC!!!!! AVOID...unless you are a clueless tourist without a functioning 

OLFACTORY NERVE...nor SALT DETECTING TASTE BUDS!

As a Hyatt Hotel Restaurant - 48 Lex  = rather pathetic, noisy, over-priced, too dark, too salty, marginal/ pretentious service, etc...

For Free with the Hyatt vouchers....well let me say, it was one of the worst meals that I have ever had in a Hyatt....

even for free....

 as a Diamond Club member

...which is saying alot!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a free standing place, apart from the Hyatt, you must be loony to pay these prices for poor to just OK food at best.  

Over Salting decent veges should be a culinary crime that should 

NOT happen, since:

1- It shows the CHEF is an imbecile & has no idea how to season.
2- You ruin a potentially nutritious vege, when the customer obviously wants a vege..
3- Over Salting is frequently used to cover up the lack of prep, taste, or freshness.
4- It shows incompetence.

POOR LIGHTING is yet another crime.

I am so said that I let my Hyatt breakfast vouchers accumulate for a over-priced dinner here...since it much harder to screw up a breakfast....which is also over-priced.

It is so dark at dinner here that you cannot read the menu & you have to use a iphone or a candle.  

The people at the next table also complained to me!!!!

The view of Lex did nothing to help see the menu....but I could clearly see other people probably going to far better dinning options!

The dinner was basically crap to my taste, & it eluded me that this place was crowded, by clueless 20-30 somethings that had money to burn.  They could not all be from my Hotel.

Thank the lord that the was a decent upscale Chinese place just across the street, that while not fantastic, did have good food & good lighting.

Staying at a upstairs suite at this Hyatt was a pleasure....but as a Diamond Club member...the lack of good eats, on site was sad.

I understand that this Hyatt, like some others are converted renovated other less hotels that only use the Hyatt name...but do not measure up to the same standards. It seems to be subcontracted out, just like this sad excuse for fine dinning.

I ate here toward the end of my Thanksgiving stay (at the Hyatt 48 Lex) as I visited my elderly mom in Brooklyn, right before she fell sick into a Coma, a few months later.

"I grew up in the neighborhood and I've eaten here numerous times. it really disappoints me that this diner does not accommodate for food allergies. My girlfriend has a food allergy which limits her from eating dairy, sugar, and gluten. Today we came to enjoy another tasty meal but we were rejected rudely by a waiter. We tried to compromise by bringing in gluten free bread since the ordinary toast would get her sick. We respected the policy of not bringing in outside food but we merely wanted to avoid her getting sick from her food allergy.

"I very much enjoyed Beauty & Essex.  It is nestled behind a little pawn shop that you must enter to get in to the restaurant.  As you walk through the entry door, you feel as if you are making a grand entrance.  To the right is the hostess to the left is a bar and right in front of you is a very cool looking 20's modern hip dining room.  We sat at a round table that made it easy to converse with everyone at the table.  We all had cocktails off the menu.  I had the Woodsman, it tasted like sugar.  I had two more.  The food is served tapas style so you share everything.  We started with the Philly Cheese Steak Slider and the Grilled Cheese Dumpling in a tomato sauce.  Both very good.  We went on the the BBQ fries and the onion rings.  The onion rings were my favorite.  Presentation was great.  I could have eaten the whole order myself.  The Bahn Mi taco and the lobster taco was next.  Lobster taco was the only disappointing tapas we ordered.  Next up was the tuna poke and the Thai style coconut shrimp.  The shrimp was fantastic, my favorite behind the onion ring.  Ribs, meatballs, empanadas to round out the meal.  The desserts were creative yet nothing special.  The Elvis Presley should be avoided.  The box of donuts is killer.  After dinner we walked upstairs to another bar, very hip with a DJ for an after dinner drink.  All in all a great evening.  I recommend going with a group of 5-8.  It did get a little loud. On the way out we almost bought a rock em sick em boxing ring game from the 80s.",0.0
"It's a quick meal at a low price and takes credit cards. The place is clean. Good to find a McDonalds if you don't know which of the local restaurants are any good. They're consistent, like all McDonalds. They always have an ""A"" inspection rating. If you get sick it was probably germs from the subway pole or something else you ate.

I don't know. Mickey D's gets a bad rap but it is cheap, fast, delicious food. You can see right back into the cooking area, nothing is hidden. Nobody forces you to eat here but you need to eat somewhere. Skip the fries and get a diet soda and you can eat quite a lot without expanding your waistline.

They even have a 99¢ ATM inside! Can't beat that unless you are lucky enough to find a branch of your own bank nearby.

"It's a Walgreen's. Is it charming? No. It's a chain drugstore. It is, however convenient as Hell, so it's a good thing to have in the neighborhood. Particularly since there's a dearth of grocery stores serving the area (with a Key Food on Myrtle to open in September, and a Wegman's in the Navy Yard in 2017), it's useful to have a spot like this to pick up sundry items.

I've been a bit disappointed by their pharmacy. I have a sick family member who needs a lot of persecution medication, and Walgreen's usually doesn't have what we need in stock. The folks working the counter are nice and helpful, but they just don't have the medication we need, which I can easily procure elsewhere.

There's often a line, especially after work, and all of the registers are never manned. The people who work there are nice and friendly. As many others have pointed out, it sometimes smells like sewage.

One last item to note, is that Walgreen's can attract some shady people. Shoplifting is apparently a big problem for them, and I once saw a nervous looking teenager try to buy 20 Applebee's gift cards with a credit card he was having trouble with, before giving up and running out of the store. It's pretty obvious the kid was just trying to get as much value out a stolen card before it got cancelled.",0.0

"This review is for takeout/delivery. 

Twice we've given Settepani a chance, and both times have been huge disappointments.  

This last time, we ordered through Seamless for a delivery of an app and two entrees.  The appetizer we received was the wrong one, and was a confusing dish of lobster, potatoes and onions -- the flavors made no culinary sense.  Our entrees -- ravioli and spaghetti -- were the absolute ****WORST**** pasta dishes I've ever tasted.  The ravioli was bland, and came in an unappetizing congealed mess.  The spaghetti was clearly made with boxed noodles boiled earlier and reheated, and the bolognese was was used very sparingly and worse than jarred sauce.  And all for the pleasure of paying $55 for a meal we had to toss after a few bites.  

The only reason I'm giving Settepani 2 stars and not 1 is that I did not get physically sick from the food.  Way to aim high, Settepani!",0.0
"Beautiful remodel. Very welcoming and warm. Thing for the kids to do in the back. Very good first impression! Then you feel the newness. Took forever to get our first drink and the glasses were dried with a dirty towel. The wine was poured very sloppy and almost dropped on my white shirt. Our second drink took forever. 
My husband's ordered the oysters which were bad. To the restaurants credit they offered any other appetizer on the house and bought our second round of wine  (hopefully he doesn't get sick tonight).   I ordered the salmon which was bland. Definitely needs more flavor. The veggies were delicious, but the menu said there horseradish in the over it and there was no flavor of horse radish. My Hubby ordered the tuna and he loved it. The sliders were done perfect. The mac and cheese was very tasty by dry. The buffalo and bleu tater tots were good but too much sauce and went uneaten. By far the most delicious dish was the maple and bacon Brussels sprouts. OMG! A must get. So many flavors. Despite the kinks, I really like this place and think it has great potential.  It took forever, literally over 2 hours to eat. I like the menu, it just needs some tweaking.  I look forward to coming again and having a better experience.",0.0
"Good food and wine. Slow-ass service. It was as if the waiter was sick, or something. He seemed pretty out of it. I'd exchange prompt service for all that farm-to-table; made-in-house chatter. (I don't really care. Sorry, locavores. You'll surely love it.)",0.0
"HORRIBLE.  There was no staff who could actually seat a table nor take an order. It appeared as if all management and waitstaff called in sick and left only the back end staff.  They did not understand the menu, how to use the credit card machines or how to place orders into the system.  The food was okay, but some of the tables food was way over cooked. Please avoid this ace at all costs.",0.0
"I could not have been more disappointed. I went a far distance to come to check out the gluten free options. The woman (owner which was even sadder)  helping me was short and rude, assuming i had no idea what gluten free meant when replying to my questions . The food was completely off in terms of flavor. The flavours made me  feel sick.  Never ever wasting my money at this place. When you have alot of allergies you would think a place like this would be welcoming!",0.0
"I actually really enjoy the service here. It seems like your typical chinese take out spot, that you can find in any neighborhood in NY, but it's more than just that. They actually use real meat, not that mystery meat that you get in other places, and can't help but blame yourself, cause you know, you only paid five dollars. The service is prompt, the food is yummy, and I have yet to get sick. Awesome!",0.0

"I went to John's Coffee Shop on 2 separate occasions, and in both occasions, their staff and service was condescending to say the least.  Their food was also nothing extraordinary.  Both times, I ordered their cheese omelette (blah!!) and coffee (lukewarm).  I like giving places the benefit of the doubt (you never know, maybe the real chef was out sick or maybe they just don't have one).  I live right in the neighborhood and it's just too bad this coffee shop is so disappointing.  Though I can see how it would appeal to unsuspecting tourists.",0.0

"I should begin by saying that I live very close to Ozone Pizza and I am there almost twice a week grabbing a slice before I head to school or late at night when I'm heading home. It is so conveniently close to the train station that I stop by when there isn't anything better to eat. 

This place is very dingy and old, you do not want to dine on their tables. Take your pizza and go home! With their dining area in such condition, one should be scorned from considering this place as an option. But hey, many still swear by their pizza. Like I said, I can grab a slice and run upstairs to get the train in about 5 minutes, my only reason. 

There is a Papa Johns closeby so my younger sister and I picked up a box of cheese sticks. We wanted a slice of pizza too but didn't want an entire box, so we decided to get one from Ozone Pizza. Their ceasar salad slice isn't to die for, but it's filling. They add way too much ingredient on EVERYTHING that they make which makes it hard to enjoy their food. You know that sick disgusting feeling you get after eating a meal with too much grease and cheese that you begin to feel like you've swallowed your whole meal without chewing? Well, that's what it feels like to eat their slices. So we ordered one ceasar salad slice TO GO. 

The entire time there the staff (about 4-5 men) interrogated us for having a box from Papa Johns. At first I thought they were joking, but boy did that table turn quick! It is cold outside, so my younger sister asked me to eat there. I didn't want to because as I've said their dining area is just disgusting. But I still asked one of the men, let's call him 'Bob', if it would be a huge deal if we ate our slice and Papa Johns there. The entire staff jumped down my throat. They explained that it would be wrong, their boss wouldn't allow it, and said that next time I should let them make the cheese sticks and then I would be allowed to eat there. Although I purchased from Ozone Pizza, I was barred from eating there. 'Bob' and his disrespectful tone added, ""you're cute and everything but no"". This last response completely ticked me off. I have my younger sister with me, that was so unnecessary. I asked for a refund right away and my slice was taken away without hesitation and my money given back to me. No apologies, no exceptions. 

Ozone Pizza will make you sick to your stomach after one slice. If you're the type of person that likes feeling heavy, bloated and clogged then by all means. If you don't believe me I urge you to try their food and tell me if you dont feel the same way. Honestly the best thing at their spot is the cherry kool-aid, so yummy! 

I will not be eating from Ozone Pizza ever again because I strongly believe that 'Bob' was either the owner or an important figure to Ozone Pizza. The hate for Papa Johns and fellow customers is real! My younger sister says that Papa John's cheese sticks tasted way better than anything that Ozone Pizza would throw together.",0.0
"We stopped in for a quick breakfast after looking in a few other places, and to our surprise this place was great! The people working were so nice and the food was delicious and came out very fast. 

We ended up speaking with who we assumed was the manager or owner about our sick friend we left at the apartment earlier that day. When we were walking out he handed us a Danish and told us to give it to our sick friend. Moral of the story this place was awesome and we will definitely be back next time we're in Brooklyn!",0.0
"These are my favorite bagels in the city. I can say that definitively because one day when I was sick, a friend picked up bagels from the supposedly best bagel shops in the city and we tried them all - and these were the best.

"WOW this was an awesome find on a random night! After a quick happy hour bite at Galli, my friend and I found this awesome hole-in-the-wall creperie just around the corner, and the smells just completely drew us in. Just because I was feeling pretty cheap for the day, I got the butter and sugar, and just...wow. The crepe was made really well, and it was just enough to tide me over without making me feel sick.

I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because there was a ton of sugar in my crepe...like I could feel the granules of attacking my teeth into cavities. But I might change that soon, because I'll definitely be back for more (esp savory crepes)!",0.0
"Will bump it up to 3 stars as I didn't get food poisoning this time around. We ordered a few kung fu xlb's (wtf is up with the name?) and one very spicy xlb (note, this is indeed full of chili oil, so non-spicy eaters beware). We also ordered a stuffed scallion pancake as well as cumin lamb, spicy chili chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and mapo tofu. Oh and 4 very expensive bowls of white rice. It's not expensive by white ppl standards, but it also bothers me SO MUCH when Asian restaurants charge for rice. This is the fiber of your people man. Ain't nobody got time to charge for rice. It's a staple that literally costs nothing to you--maybe 25 cents a bowl when it comes down to it. I just think it's silly to charge $1.50 for a bowl when the bowl is TINY. Props to the waitress though for being honest. The exchange literally went as: 

""You guys charge for RICE???! How big we talking, *this big? or *THIS big?"" 
""..No dont-ah worry. It's very small. Very, very small.""
""Oh. ok then.""

Anyway, as far as the food goes, the xlb is fine. Didn't feel robbed being charged what we did for them and the very spicy version was indeed very spicy. The cumin lamb is where it starts to teeter towards the regrettable. Small, nearly nonexistent pieces of lamb dot the plate. Meanhile you've got cilantro and onion cuts the size of my fingers scattered throughout. The mapo tofu and the eggplant were both excellent. The spicy chili chicken was an absolute joke tho. It was more like tiny crumbs of chicken rolled into massive balls of dough, so much that each resultant bite was akin to biting into a fried oil pustule. Pretty dang gross yo. 

So it's 3 stars for me. And that's more than fair for this spot.",0.0
"I made a reservation through Open Table for Valentine's day. There was no cancellation policy listed (except that you have to cancel directly with the restaurant and not online) and no one ever called to confirm my reservation/inform me of any cancellation policy.

I called before noon on Valentine's day to cancel my reservation since my boyfriend woke up very sick. The woman informed me that they were going to charge my card the cost of 2 pri fix meals (about $280) if we canceled the reservation. Obviously I still had to cancel...we weren't going to go to dinner when my boyfriend had a fever of over 100 degrees. I asked to speak to a manager but was informed he was not available, but that he would call me on Monday or Tuesday to discuss the charge. I was informed the manager is Sean Hennessy. 

My card was charged and I did not hear from Sean. I called three times throughout the week asking for him - the hostess I spoke to was very polite and told me she had informed Sean of my situation, emailed him about it, told him to call me, and saw that no one had called to confirm my reservation or told me about any cancellation policy ahead of time. She said he had a long list of people to call regarding the same issue, but it looks like he never did that.

I ended up having to claim the charge as fraud, although I tired very hard to sort the issue out cordially with the restaurant. Sean's complete disregard of the situation and refusal to take my call to discuss the issue is the absolute worst customer service I have ever received in new york city. It is abusive and borderline illegal for them to charge a card without ever disclaiming the cancellation policy...let alone just horrible customer service to not allow someone to cancel plenty of hours in advance when they are sick... and then refuse to even call the customer back to work the issue out. I will obviously never make a reservation at The Lion again and would have serious concerns about any other restaurant Sean Hennessy is managing.",0.0
"I've have ordered from Thai 101 a handful of times over the past 3 years that I've lived in the neighborhood. My very first experience was great. Then it started going downhill...about 6 months ago I ordered from there and I got so sick I had to call out of work the next day. When I walked by a few days later they were closed down.

My boyfriend mistakenly ordered from there two nights ago and they said it would be delivered in about 25 minutes. 45 minutes later he called to ask how much longer it would be and they said it was on the way already. We live probably 2 blocks away. 25 minutes after that it arrived. Our pad thai with shrimp was tasteless and had only shrimp tails in it, no actual shrimp... it honestly looked like they piled the leftovers from a bunch of people's plates into a takeout container and delivered it to us. We also got pineapple fried rice that was also pretty lackluster. We will be trying one of the new spots in the hood next time!",0.0
"I just left the Dr. at 40 wall street. And will never go there again. The last time I went, I said that I'm experiencing flu symptoms, she said ,"" oh no, that's impossible."" and refused to give me antibiotics. Two days later I was sick with the flu, which was confirmed by a different doctor and was sick for three weeks.

Today I went for a visit explaining that my throat was sore, I was achy and that both of my kids are sick, one with a sinus infection, the other with bronchitis who both had the same symptoms. 

She adamantly said,"" I'm not going to give you antibiotics. If you don't like the way I practice medicine, you can go somewhere else.""

Not only will I go somewhere else, I will make it a point to tell as many people as possible not to EVER go the walk in at Duane Reade 40 Wall because the Doctor there not only has a GOD complex, but is wrong.

I will also be disputing the charge to my health insurance carrier and my Co-pay.

This Doctor thinks she knows everything and cost me three weeks of my life by refusing to give me a flu test the last time I was there with the flu.

"Like any typical all-you-can-eat sushi places, Mika serves a plentiful amount of food at not the best quality. So don't go in expecting Izakaya or Nakazawa, because if you start complaining about how the fish isn't the freshest thing you've tasted in all your life, you're only cheating the restaurant because that's not what they are advertising. For what it's worth, I think Mika is an excellent addition to the Chinatown food scene, especially since it brings us the Japanese cuisine that is so scarce here.

Located above the Maid Café (never been there, but much too scared to try it), the restaurant has a nice mood lighting and has that ""Japanese-y"" feel, know what I mean? A lot of wooden furniture with drapes and such. I came with a party of four with the Groupon deal and sat at a single table (all four of us facing each other, instead of 2 facing 2). I point this out because it is much easier to split dishes this way than at typical ayce sushi places that have their tables lengthwise. We also had a bit of a mix-up with the Groupon, but the lady I made reservations with was nice enough to let it slide and let us use it. Awesome!

The service, like people were saying, is a bit slow. I think there were two sushi chefs, two waitresses, and I don't know how many were in the kitchen. One of the waitresses also seemed to switch back and forth from being the hostess. While they were nice and attentive, there were times it took us a while to grab their attention. The food also came out a bit slow, but considering how good everything tasted, I didn't mind. The salmon, Hamachi, and spicy scallop were all very delicious. I was surprised that our third order of fish actually had the best quality. Everything tasted fine and I didn't suffer any food poisoning the next day. The seaweed salad was good. I would personally skip the teriyaki, katsu, and calamari next time. The sushi is too good to ignore. My friend really enjoyed the Pink Lady Roll. I don't remember all the rolls, but I enjoyed all of them except the West Roll, which I found a bit mediocre. The rest were great!

"Very nice interior. Great for dinner! We came here right after the Whitney Museum (they are very close together so if you are in town for vacation, I would recommend ending the museum day here to share plates and have some drinks). 

This restaurant is perfect for sharing plates (sharing is the whole concept of this place). 

We had: mussels, lobster roll, shrimp cakes, spicy pork and coconut rice. I drank mai tai and my friends had prosecco and spritz. The service was excellent! I read some bad reviews before coming here but decided to give it a try and it was worth it. Maybe we were lucky but everything was very good. We came on a Thursday night at 8:00pm and had a blast!

"Not sure if anyone else knows my struggle, but if you're getting the hungry's at 2 am in the morning and you're sick of getting dunking donuts and deli food, most of the time you're stuck heating up old leftovers you don't want to touch or eating another cup o'noodles. But thank god for late night ramen! This particular case, I was starving after a grueling 9 hour flight and definitely didn't want to touch another bag of chips. This cozy ramen bar hits the spot. 

Perks:
-one free noodle refill after 11 PM
-$1.50 Gyoza on Monday nights! 
-broth is flavorful and yummy! None of that watered-down crap.
- service is attentive and friendly! Even at 2 am in the morning :)
-prices are super reasonable ($11-$15 for one bowl)

Downsides:
-charge for hot tea. 
-$20.00 minimum for credit card charge
- place is tiny. If you want to hide from the door, good luck, because when others come in, you will feel the wind.

"Oh man!  After eating at Ramen Misoya this past Friday night, I was itching to eat ramen, again, today, so my boyfriend and I headed out to this place.

This place is the bomb diggity, yo'!  It's a very small, hole-in-the-wall place.  Nice and cozy decor and a sense of ""Japanese-Americanism"" in the air.  I was already judging the place according to the ambiance, thinking it may not be good, but oh hell!  Was I wrong!  The appetizers and ramen, here, is bomb.com!

I ordered Spicy Shio Ramen (comes with black garlic oil, chashu, green onion, and thin noodles).  I also ordered extra corn and extra bamboo shoots (Menma).  It was so deliciously good!  The broth was great, not too thick, yet not too thin, and very flavorful.  The chashu was excellent, fatty and juicy, just the way I like it, marinated to perfection.  Green onion was crisp and fresh.  The corn and bamboo shoots were alright, but added in together with everything else, it tasted good!

I also ordered Spicy Gyoza.  This was your typical Japanese ""gyoza,"" pan-fried, just the way that I like it (not that fried shit at inauthentic Japanese places that are Americanized...they have a lot of that stuff back home in Cali), and it was drizzled with Japanese spice.  On the side, there was gyoza dipping sauce.  Each Spicy Gyoza plate only came with about 7 pieces, but those 7 pieces were so delicious and went perfectly with my ramen!

Lastly, I also ordered the ""Curry Rice Set,"" so my ramen came with a side of curry over rice, in a bowl (with pickled ginger on the side).  This, my friends, was delicioso as well!  I ate it heartily and happily (lol, can't you tell that I simply LOVE food?!).

The portions of these dishes were the perfect size, too; there wasn't so much that made you feel sickly, yet there wasn't too little that you were left craving for more.  The service here is also good, they have more manners and class here than at Ramen Misoya (where at Ramen Misoya, they kept asking us if we were done, 'cause I know they wanted to go home - the jerks!).

A bit on the pricey side, but it's worth it, if you really want great ramen in NYC.

They also opened another branch on 11/1 on 3rd Street.  I'll probably try that place later on, as well.

Overall, I would highly recommend this place to family and friends who want some good ramen in NYC!  All hail, RAMEN-YA!  YATA!!!!!!!  Hai, oishii desu!!!!!!!!!

"I'v been here a few times already all different times.  Each time it is different.  But tonight it was the first time that I came by to try their food that Yelpers have been thumbs upping about.

I can tell you this, the quality is real.

The SPACE is exactly how you might imagine a bar but with a classier twist.  It is a hybrid in between a place that you would come to watch sports, a place that you can come to have a romantic dinner, and a place that you can come for brunch as there are seating outdoors available DAY & NIGHT.  The seating outdoors is configured with 4 square tables with 4 seats per table and also 4 rectangle tables that has 2 seats per table.  It is great if you come as a group or if you solo dolo-ing the night, that is an option as well.  I think the most convenient thing about this particular location is that TD bank is across the street and Chase bank is on the same street on the other corner.  There is no excuse to forget to bring cash if you come to eat or drink here.  None at all.

The interior layout is a little bit trickier.  Most tables are 4 seaters with exception to the rectangle tables that seats 2 people lined up on the other side of the glass if you were sitting outside looking in.   In the center there is a strip of wooden, slim long high-tops that people use as addition bar counter if the bar gets too full.  You can a great view of both the 3 medium sized TV right above behind the bar for NFL games, College games, and just sports in general.  And if you want to be nosy you can also peek at what other people is seating as the center high-top table has a direct overview of two tables that seats 4 people each.

Advice?  Be nosy AND watch the game.  WIN.

The FOOD was pretty good.  I really don't expect much quality from bars in general.  If they have the quality it is great but normally just as long as it tastes fine and won't give me food poisoning is really my sticking point.  But first and foremost I am a BURGER MAN so naturally...

...I ordered the SIGNATURE BANTER BURGER ($12.00) WELL DONE and it came exactly as I ordered it.   This place does well done, WELL.  It came out well done and still was moist and flavorful.  The buns wedging the burger was also nice and firm not toasted.  The bottom bun was a little bit soggy but that might have been because the burger was juicy.  You really can't complain about that at all.  I just want to note it so that you get your fingers ready for that firm hold.  The sides that the burger came with was regular French fries that I didn't really care for.  But one word describes this burger : DELICIOUS.

Along with my food, I ordered the double entendre THE HONEY BUSH ($9.00) cocktail. Man, let me tell you...this bush was pretty good.  Bushmills Honey Whiskey dancing with lemon juice and honey ginger all up in my mouth.  I drank that like I was doing another favorite activity of mine ...in bed...I've said too much. Very smooth, very tasty.

For the finale, I had to do it up with the BEER because what burger guy doesn't like beer?  PFFT...eff out of here...However, I went on the light side with beer and ordered the ACE PERRY PEAR CIDER ($7.00).  I think this is one of the better cider's I've had and after tonight it is on my list of cider to order if I'm trying to drink sweet.  Mildly sweet body with crisp and smooth finish.  Need I say more?

The PRICE is pretty much standard for FoHi (Forest Hills).

The SERVICE is where I have to dock a pt.  I really thought long and hard about this because the service AFTER I seated myself was VERY GOOD.  But I just can't let the crappy service as I walk in slide especially if they weren't a full house on a Thursday night.  I walk in around 8:20pm pretty much right before NFL kickoff. There was a hostess podium, NO HOSTESS.  Fine, so I'm looking for a waiter or waitress.  A waitress walks by not even glancing my direction and walks away.  

Okay...I wasn't going to stand there all awkward so I found myself a seat by the window.  5 minutes later one of the Spanish waiters comes by and brings me a drink menu and a food menu.  Ironically enough, the female waitress comes to check on me AFTER the Spanish waiter gives me the menu being all cordial.  She also was the person who brought out the burger for me.   Funny stuff.  The service for the rest of the night was good but it was on a much slower scale than most bars or restaurants.  BUT unless you came here to eat while waiting to watch a movie next door, sorry to break it to you; you will miss the previews and quite possibly the first 7 minutes of the flick.   Or if you are late for a suntanning session up the block, if that is your thing; I wouldn't sweat it.  Enjoy the ambiance and the games on the tele.

Overall, I still had a better night than Aaron Rodger did playing the Seahawks defense.  Ouch.

"This place use to be good, back in the day about 7years ago.  I was really hoping that the food quality will be better, but it has not.  The manager there is very rude, and doesn't know how to talk to people.  I order the escovich fish, which was dry with the meat sticking to the bone, and they gave me a hard piece of bammy.  I asked for a strawberry diarrhea, and they gave me something red that tasetd like pure sugar.  The food is over priced for the quality of the food that they are serving.

Went to Calle Ocho for brunch  with  some friends and we had a wonderful time. The food was OK but the drinks was strong. Oh my the Sangria's was plentiful. The drinks are very strong. I have to say the drinks was a little bit much for some people because when we walk in  some woman who couldn't handle her drinks puke all over the place which was gross. I'm not sure if she had alcohol poisoning but an ambulance had to be called. I'm like wtf if you can't handle your alcohol don't drink that much. There was also another chick who was also very drunk and her friends had to carry her out. Overall we had a great time.,0.0
"Good God. The first words out of my mouth when I took my first bite of the artichoke pizza were, ""HOLY SH!T."" 
This pizza is amazing. I'm not even a big fan of pizza, but I'm already craving it again after having had it for dinner a few hours ago.
4.75 for a huge slice of pizza that takes up two paper plates? No problem. TAKE MY MONEY!!!
It's hard to describe exactly all the sensations that happen in your mouth when you eat this. It's cheesy, and artichokey, but creamy, but bready, but not nauseating and not a flavor that you get sick of.
However, the slice is extremely oily and huge, so if you have a small stomach like me, you probably won't be able to finish.
My friend got the crab pizza slice and it was also delicious. I want to say that I'll get it next time, but I'm just so hooked on the artichoke!",0.0
"Usually I take-out many delicious chicken cutlet sandwiches so I tried something new by ordering the Baysider burger. But after being sick eating the Baysider, I don't think I will be back for it. It was soaked in oil and made me sick to my stomach. I was dying at work. I know I came at a busy hour, but if i paid 12 for a burger i expect it to be savoring. I will be back for a sandwich but not a burger!

Update:

I went back for another try. I got the Paul's burger. So. Damn. Good. Bun was not soggy. Fries was on point with that seasoning. My burger was cooked just right. Im telling you, this meat was full of flavor. Just eating a piece of meat was delicious and fulfilling.  Glad i gave another shot. I must come back to try out all their burgers.

"I went here for my best friend's birthday party/bachelorette party. We booked the party through Birthday Party Booker, a bottle service company. They guaranteed that we would have a free table and a free bottle of champagne or vodka. We originally booked the party at Hudson Common, 1 of the bars in the Hudson Hotel. Little did we know this is where the problems would start.

We arrived on time like we said we were and when we checked in with the concierge, they told us that we weren't on the list. I showed them the emails between me and Birthday Party Booker. They then told us that we had to wait for a table to open up. At this bar, they have picnic tables seating. Some tables were barely filled but concierge told us that they were ""reserved"" and the guests would be arriving soon, so we couldn't sit there. Umm hello we had reservations too but they didn't want to give us a table. Luckily, I think a manager came over to us and told us that they had at table opened at Henry, their other bar in the Hudson Hotel. 

Henry had a different vibe from Hudson Common. Hudson Common was a combination of a sports bar and beer garden. Henry was a loungey, classy bar. Little did I know, it was the complete opposite. We sat down and we told them that we had a bottle service deal where we would get a free bottle of champagne or vodka. They brought out this obscure brand of vodka. It was pretty weak (it tasted as if it were watered down, which I wouldn't be surprised). My friends and I finished that and were just dancing and having a good time. People were nice and social. We each ordered our own cocktails and either danced or sat at the table. About a half hour into getting the table, the cocktail waitresses moved all of our bags and jackets to the side, so some other group that was ordering bottle service could sit down at our table. Nobody even told us that they were moving our stuff. If we didn't see them move our stuff, who knows what could have happened to our bags and jackets. That was just another nuisance to the night.

1 of the girls drank too much and got sick, so me and 3 other girls just went to the entrance of ""Henry"" and just sat down on their bench because the sick girl just needed some air. She also needed to use the bathroom, so I went to help bring her to the bathroom. The bouncer was going to let me back into ""Henry"" but not the sick girl. I wasn't just going to leave her, so we decided to walk across the hotel to go to the bathroom near ""Hudson Common"", the original bar we tried to go but didn't ""have reservations"" for. The bathroom was probably 5 yards away from ""Hudson Common"" and we didn't have to wait on line when we first got there but the bouncer was a dick and made us wait on a short line. The line wasn't even for the bathroom. It was for getting into ""Hudson Common."" I tried explaining to him that we just had to go to the bathroom and he didn't care. He still made us go on line behind a few people and checked our ids. When the sick girl just said she had to use the bathroom, that's when shit hit the fan. The bouncer proceeded to walkie talkie to others that we're being kicked out. Wtf getting kicked out for what? For a sick girl that just wanted to go to the bathroom but the bouncer wanted to give us a hard time? Mmmhmmm perhaps she should have puked right in front of your lame bars. So as the sick girl and I started to walk back to ""Henry"" to pick up our jackets/bags, the bouncer starts to taunt us and continues to tell us that we're kicked out blah blah blah. I wasn't going to leave without my bag or my jacket. Then this other manager comes out of nowhere and grabs my arm to push me out. I'm 100% sober and wasn't being rude or anything. I did nothing to warrant being grabbed, so I told that manager to get his hands off of me. Some of my friends were still at ""Henry"", so as I was texting them to come out and bring my stuff out, the original dickhead bouncer starting yelling at me and talking shit about my mother. He was so unprofessional and so rude, calling my mother a concubine, etc... Who says concubine anymore? Are we back in imperial China? There's a reason why he's a bouncer and not a rocket scientist.

Another incident was when 2 of our friends were at the bar, getting ready to leave. 1 girl was paying with her credit card and it dropped on the floor. The bartender immediately swooped it up and wouldn't give it back to her, saying that the credit card wasn't hers, etc... My friend was like ""that is my credit card. That's my name. Here's my id"" blah blah blah. After a 5 minute debacle, the bartender finally gave back her credit card. Why would the bartender do that? Weird. 

This whole establishment should get negative stars. ""Hudson Common"" and ""Henry"" are trying to keep up with the big boys (1Oak, Avenue, etc...) but unfortunately, they just don't have their shit together. Train your staff better and treat paying customers better.",0.0
"I don't know what's up with the bad reviews, except that they are fake. The telltale sign is that each person has only one other review that's also 1 star. 

Anyway, on to my review that's actually real. El Cortez is a great place for yummy Mexican food and tasty cocktails. I go there about three times a week to eat their chips and salsa and a veggie burrito and i'm still not sick of it. The bartenders are super friendly too, which is always a bonus ;)",0.0
"I was a fan of this place from the very beginning! The staff was very friendly, the food was fresh, delicious, and most importantly gluten free! I suffer from Celiac so this is very important to me... 
However like most customers, I was shocked when the place was shut down in January by food inspectors. Some neighbors claimed to have seen an exterminator truck, others like myself just have no clue why they closed for about a month, give or take. 
When the place opened again, and having such a limited number of gluten free restaurant options in the neighborhood, I couldn't help but to go and enjoy the deliciousness of these arepas. 
Unfortunately something changed, to name a few... everything tasted different, the arepas are smaller, the tostones are huge (they use to be small about 8 or so pieces with lots of cheese, and now you get about 4 or 5 huge ones with less cheese), and the passionfruit sangria is a little more bitter.
Lets not forget to mention the inflation of arepa prices, especially for the chicken pabellon arepa... i recall this arepa costing 650 or 725 something in this range, and now it is 850! probably the most expensive arepa on the menu. 
Lastly the grade pending sign at the entrance of the door turned me off. I also managed to ask one of the nice waiters why the place was shutdown, and he mentioned something about pipes being broken in the kitchen, not sure if this is true but either way something was different, and not in a good way! 

I took some time off.. 2 months or so. On a beautiful afternoon I decided to go have lunch at the bar. I was greeted by a different waiter. He was very passive aggressive to say the least, and kind of dismissive. I wasn't going to let his demeanor ruin my happy mood. I went ahead an ordered. I asked for a chicken arepa and then noticed it would've been better to order a lunch special combo, which was a FREE DRINK (natural juice or fresh spring water) + arepa. I asked if i could get the combo with the same choice of arepa, and he said sure. I told him I wanted the juice, but he mentioned they were out of the flavored juice I wanted so I asked him for the water instead.
 I assumed by fresh spring water it meant a BOTTLED water!!! (as THIS IS WHAT I WAS GIVEN THE LAST TIME I ORDERED) instead he gave me tap water with ice. I asked him if that was correct and he said 'yes, why ? you want a bottle or something?'...ABSOLUTELY RUDE. I DID NOT WANT TO SNAP AT HIM, SO i said it was fine. 
Why the ---K would tap water be part of a combo, isn't tap water free in NY?
 anyway, I was very polite, gave him his 20% tip and promised to never go here again. 

However, not too long ago my family decided they wanted to go. Not only were they doing construction WHILE people were having dinner but the place smelled like nail polish remover. I think construction should be done when food isn't nearby. 
My family tried the sangria and they mentioned it tasted bitter and different. They mentioned the difference in the food as well, and unfortunately My mother and I both got sick from gluten poisoning. Im not sure how this could have happened but I believe it was from the large tostones. I can only ASSUME that the chefs are new, and instead of making the tostones small and frying them separately etc etc, they are being dipped in the same oil as the appetizers that are covered in dough or breadcrumb. 

unfortunately I will not be returning to this place. I do not believe this place is 100% safe for Gluten sensitive customers due to cross-contamination!

It is sad that this place has lowered its standards, it now reminds me of the Arepas grill on 36 avenue (which I believe has a B rating). It now has a very careless, messy, dirty fast food feel to the place when it use to be a very edgy clean hyped friendly restaurant feel.Maybe it actually is all those things, and this place is actually dirty? therefore Grade Pending for months now? Also, what happened to the friendly staff?",0.0
"Scariest experience ever. I ordered the bone marrow brisket burger and took my first bite and thought something felt really off. I open my burger and find my patty COVERED in PLASTIC. At that point, I felt really nauseous and sick to my stomach just thinking that I bit into that. 

I called the waitress over and the manager came and gave me a free meal and drinks but this is UNACCEPTABLE. How did the chef even cook the burger with the plastic on without even noticing? When you come to a restaurant, you don't come to play health inspector, you come to enjoy a good meal.

The owner and waitresses were amicable but they're really lucky I have such high tolerance for this kind of stuff and didn't dramatize the situation. Regardless, this is CRAZY for a restaurant that's supposedly gotten so many good reviews.

Never coming back here again, jesus.",0.0
"Well, what can I say about this place. First, let me say I'm Caribbean and a single parent with two kids. I can most definitely cook! And I don't have money to waste. Buttt, I was tired from work and decided to stop at Empanada Mama Express. Since I've eaten the empanadas before; and thought they were good, I figure I would try the entrées. NEVER AGAIN! I am so disappointed, disgusted and just plain sick to my stomach. I got the ARROZ CON POLLO...The best thing in the container was the plantains. The food was sour and dry. The chicken was obviously sitting around for at least 3 to 4 days because it smelled sour and tasted sour. The price was $15.75 wayyy over priced and ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH the money. It isn't worth in my opinion, even $5. And I think the long blondish string I pulled out of the rice was a hair in the food. As for the two women serving there, well can you say charm school! They have no people skills. The guy I met the first time was nicer and more attentive. The only reason I am even giving it 2 Stars is because I do like the empanadas. They don't skimp on the filling...hopefully it's fresh and without hair! Empanadas, maybe! Entrees, NOOO! I wish I had taken a pic before I threw it out...darn! Eat carefully NY...",0.0
"My uncle just went to pick up an order from your location on 6th Ave in the West Village. This was written on the container by your staff. He went back for a refund and to demand an apology and your manager would not apologize or ""rat out"" who did it.

First of all, I'd like to know, from genuine curiosity, how a restaurant chain like yours could hire people like that in an age of online reviews, social media, and savvy, empowered consumers. I'm telling as many people as possible about this and advising them not to eat there, as are my family members and everyone who's close to them. I'm also, of course, just floored by this behavior. When someone plans to spend money in your establishment, if you think they're trash, don't take their money. If you do, don't call them trash.

"I am stunned with so many positive reviews for this asian buffet establishment.  I've dined here about 3 times with each time hoping it will change my outlook of this place but I still leave with the same opinion.  

Not sure how the weeknights are but during weekends this place gets packed like they are giving out something free.  So be warned about that.  

The food has a decent variety selection of cooked foods and sushi but nothing that really stood out to be honest.  Sushi is not really that fresh but yes I know not to expect that so I will reserve my judgement.  As long as it doesn't get me sick or taste funny, it will do just fine.  I wish they had a larger selection of cooked foods because after the 2nd plate, I am really bored of what else is left to offer here.   Dessert options are limited as well.  Overall, not a fan and wouldn't recommend.

I prefer Mizumi buffet over here any day of the week.",0.0
"If you are looking for a wide and unique variety of teas, this place has got you covered. With a counter of wall to wall cannisters teas, you can pretty much walk up to a worker and tell them what you like and they will pull out the best thing ever.

But i stopped and went into the store becuase I had to have the tea that I just tasted. Cream of Earl Grey. Do yourself a favor and get a batch for those cold wintry nights where a hot chocolate just wont suffice. This creamy and decadent tea makes me feel fancy. And cozy. 
Speaking of cozy, i also stocked up on some cold 911 tea because when i found myself sick last year with the flu during flu season, this miracle tea was sold out. Its packed with echinechea, lemon and euchalyptus to sooth sore throats and releive sinus congestion.

"Conveyer belt sushi, as you may already know.

I come here with a significantly lowered mindset than let's say, if I'm going to Blue Ribbon, because let's be real, not only is this just conveyer belt sushi, but on Friday and Saturday night after 11 PM... it's HALF-OFF PLATES. 

And by HALF-OFF plates, I mean... $1.50 plates being knocked down to 75 cents. What is typically a $3 plate of Salmon sashimi is $1.50, a $4 plate of something more complex like the ""Rainbow Roll"" is only $2, etc. etc. You get it. This is as dirt cheap for sushi as you can get EVER in NYC... and it's not half bad. It's actually pretty good and by pretty good, I haven't gotten sick, so... Five stars.

For the people complaining about the service and sushi being ""average"" ... What do you expect in the first place?

1) You're playing your cards wrong -- There are deals every day (ex. Salmon Tuesdays) so there's no way I'd ever pay full price here.
2) It's conveyer belt sushi

Be forewarned, it gets extremely busy at the stroke of 11 PM when it officially becomes sushi ""Happy Hour."" Either get there beforehand or risk waiting a godawful amount of time...

Or do what my boyfriend and I did and proceed upstairs to their bar/karaoke area to avoid the 50 minutes wait (per their suggestion), suck up the possibly-horrifying experience of forcibly listening to drunk early-30-something's drunkenly scream/slobber over the karaoke machine (this is basically hell on earth), and sit your pretty asses down because this is $1-$3 sushi plates and yes, they serve it upstairs, and yes...

"Love this place. Two of my fav foods are oysters and Korean so this spot was an easy   5 stars for me.

It's not that I'm cheap, but I have a hard time spending more than a buck fiddy on an east coast oyster, and this is the main reason I venture above 14th St. To Barn Joo. To slurp theirs shucks.

$1 Blue Points (or what ever they choose for the day) all day every day!! Not just for happy hour.

During the day the deal is throughout the whole place regardless where you sit, but in the evening buck oysters are only in the back room and bar.

They are the fastest shuckers I've ever seen and I think they may have a shucking machine er something in the back. 18 oysters in 5 min, no joke. Not sure how they do it...

One more thing and I'll shut up about the oysters; is their BBQ-sauce-like cocktail sauce they provide. They give cocktail sauce and marionette sauce as well, but this addition really give it a different twist that you'll be excited about especially when you've been using cocktail sauce as long as I have.

All the rest of the food is great as well including the Korean Fried chicken, and they have a dope beer list (with S H Doublewhite) and sick cocktails with Korean inspirations.",0.0
"Four of us went here for a late breakfast yesterday, Sunday, February 8, 2015.  We had just left a hotel and had a bunch of bags with us.  The hostess offered to check our bags for us and we gladly took her up on that offer.  It took a little while to get service and we later found out that a few people had called in sick.  We wound up being served by both the manager and a server for another area who helped out.  Although slow at times, they were friendly and put up with us - one of our friends is quite the character.  Two of us got omelets, one got Eggs Benedict and one got smoked salmon, smoked bacon and pickled beets.  We all really enjoyed the food.  Everything was done perfectly.

Once inside we circled around 2-3x trying to find a seat in the main section but were unsuccessful. Ordered drinks at the bar and tried our luck on top the second smaller boat. Found a seat quickly & were able to then go back and order food. You order food at the bar where you're given a pager to come back when it's ready.

"""I would give this place 0 stars if I could.""

Never thought I'd drop that line, but I just did and will do so again: I would give this place 0 stars if I could. 

Being that giving an establishment 0 stars isn't possible, I'll start this off by saying that this is a 0-star review for Holey Cream.

I seriously thought I was on some hidden camera show like ""Mystery Diners"" or something because I'm not even sure if you'd believe my experience as described with 100% accuracy below:

I could've *maybe* *possibly* **but not really** forgiven the guy who used his bare thumb to scoop a hanging edge of ice cream back into the cup before serving it to the patrons ahead of me in line. I witnessed it happen in what felt like slow motion, and I currently feel like I may have done the wrong thing by not speaking up for the couple that accepted the ice cream not knowing about the dirty scheme that was pulled.

No, it wasn't that which had me feeling sick to my stomach -- it was the rude, disgusting, and painfully awkward staff that portrayed the lowest of the low in terms of customer service and professionalism (or lack there of). I understand that this is a hole-in-the-wall ice cream joint that relies on the gimmick of sandwiching mediocre ice cream between two halves of a stale, dry, week old looking doughnut to sustain its business, but when you put one employee training another (or in this instance, one incompetent employee disrespectfully yelling and belittling the young employee that he was ""training"") on public display, I'd assume one would go about it in a polite manner that won't have customers running out the door. After the young trainee was pushed aside due to not doing a good enough job by the big mean guy's standards, it came our turn to be served by this bare-handed ice-cream-touching lack-of-people-skills so-awkward-I-just-can't employee, who, I kid you not, literally readjusted his face with a few scrunches of his eyes and nose together and changed his look from bossy/angry to a scary, blatantly fake, I can't even describe how uncomfortable, twitchy grin. Someone from the group I was with reluctantly ordered ice cream from this guy as he was the only person serving it, and he managed to get a few scoops into a cup while shouting insults at his fellow employees -- how talented of him. Why didn't I just walk out at that point? I did... I literally just walked away and went outside to take a breather while the group that I was with was already committed and ordered their ice cream.

I spent the rest of the time in a daze over what had happened, and was in disbelief that this wasn't some sort of nightmare. I broke the silence on this matter with the group, and after a good laugh, realized that I wasn't the only one who saw the craziness go down at Holey Cream.",0.0
"Deserves to be out of business.

I assume the only reason this place continues to be open is that it is basically on the corner of Times Square and, you know, there are A LOT of tourists who recognize the concept of ""Chinese Food"" wandering the Theatre District.

I have only eaten at this restaurant once which could mean they just had THE MOST OFF DAY IN THE HISTORY OF RESTAURANTS. But, that one time was so bad that I will NEVER return, so I think it warrants a review. 

Had an early dinner here with a small group of people on the break of ""Wolf Hall"" (between the 3 hr matinee of ""Wolf Hall"" and 3 hour evening performance of ""Bring up the Bodies""). First Red Flag: Headed to the Ladies Room after being seated. The Ladies Room looked like it had been the scene of a RIOT, overflowing waste paper basket, trash EVERYWHERE. Now I know that the restaurant's employees saw this because the door to the ""Employee Locker Room"" was IN the Ladies Rooms (presumably only for female employees). So every employee coming on or going off shift walked through that restroom, past the enormous mess and no one did a thing about it. What this tells me is that NO ONE at this restaurant cares about anything: what the customers think; what their experience is like; whether or not the place is clean...

Also, if the parts of the restaurant I could SEE were that unkempt/cared for I was officially afraid for what the parts I could not see were like (i.e., the kitchen). 

I wanted to leave after having used the restroom, but could not since I was with a group. So I sat down at our large, round table which had a big lazy susan in the middle of it with our empty water glasses arranged on it. Red Flag #2: the water glasses were FILTHY. Not usable. Which means that someone ""washed"" them and thought they looked acceptably clean. Then someone else set the table with them thinking they looked  acceptably clean. They were not. They were shockingly filthy. I asked our waitress to please bring us new, CLEAN, water glasses before actually giving us water. She took all the dirty glasses away and never came back. Dropped our table and apparently gave it to a different waiter.

Yes, it only got worse from there.

Food looked and tasted good when it finally arrived, but I was seriously afraid I might be felled by some horrific food poisoning by then. Just a terrible, terrible restaurant experience.

"Pretty good food but horrible service. It's not great for parties more than 4. I went with my family about a month after they opened for dinner. They take forever to bring your food and it's always one by one despite there being 4/5 cooks behind the glass. I didn't believe my brother nor the previous reviews when they said friends of the staff and owner got served first, but I saw it with my own eyes. How does a couple that came in an hour after  we did get served first? (It's sushi, it's  not like we order steak and they ordered a salad). 

The food is actually pretty good, but at the rate they serve you won't  be full for a while, which seems counterproductive to me - customers eat more, stay longer for the same price? You're not doing your business well. It's also super annoying because you have to reserve a spot ahead of time. They also falsely advertise their menu items. Firstly, some of the items are unavailable and secondly their menu says they have takeout/delivery but when I asked the next time I went (hoping to circumvent the wait) I was told they didn't actually have takeout.

The only defining part of that evening was the nice hostess who spoke english, and at the end when all the staff's friends left we finally got food faster and they let us stay after the store was closed (as they should).

Cheese fries were crisp outside, tender inside. Our other kids got a Fat Cat (with bacon & fried egg), Chicken Tacos (?), along with chili cheese fries. Everything was delicious, and prepared well. We also indulged with shakes, which were out of this world - I got the Fudge Brownie Shake, which was totally sick; my wife got the Campfire, which tasted of toasted marshmallow.

It is evident that BC uses really fresh and quality ingredients. 

Came here with a friend for brunch on Saturday. We started with bellinis and the Court Street bloody Mary. So good! Gave you a nice buzz, but not too much of one. The Court Street bloody Mary came garnished with antipasto! After much deliberation, I settled on the A-B-C grilled cheese. I think it's called the ABC grilled cheese, because they're schoolin' people on how to make the grilled cheese. Apples, bacon, and cheddar baked into what felt like butter soaked fresh bread was heaven on earth, soooo good. I got a side of bacon which was absolutely delicious and different than other bacon in its bold flavor. My friend got the burger which she loved and a cheddar waffle which was great. The house made pickles are perfection, you must try them! We could taste a lot of buttery goodness in a lot of what we ate, and it was just amazing. The restaurant 's ambiance can only be described as darling, adorable, country meets Brooklyn, and fun. Our waiter was the best, provided excellent service.

So here's the back story. Mario from Super Mario Bros slept with Rudy Giuliani. I'm not sure how or why this happened - Mario must have been drunk because he usually just likes Italian chicks, and younger chicks at that. Such as the Toadstool girl. Rudy really got inside Mario's head and made him fall in love (don't ask me how) and then Mario decided to sell the whole SMB franchise out to Disney and start making cartoons (and movies with Bob Hoskins for that matter). Luigi was sick as a dog by this point, it's one thing to find out your brother is bi (which Luigi knew anyway and was totally cool about), but for him to be sleeping with the Republican Disney Mayor himself, was just too much for Luigi to take. Not to mention that Giuliani was working for a rival Mafioso family to Mario/Luigi, so there was a whole Montague vs Capulet thing going on there. Ultimately, Luigi decided to ""get out of the whole thing"", quit the Mafia, quit the Mario Bros, and opened this unbelievably amazing pizza place - the best slice in NYC? Definitely in Brooklyn.

What to get: Fresh Mozzarella Slice.
What else: All of it.
And then: The Fresh Mozz slice is so good, even a meat lover would be willing to rename Brooklyn ""Broccolyn"" after eating it.

I asked Luigi about the whole split from Mario. His response was: ""I mean think about it. The whole thing was named after him anyway. Why couldn't it have been the Super Luigi Brothers, am I right?"" I kind of agree with him.

Congratulations. You have found Brooklyn's best pizza slice. There is no other pizza in New York City that is significantly better than Luigi's. The only one which comparable is my favourite, the Garlic Bread Pizza at Sunnyside Pizza in Queens. But Luigi's is the #1 for traditional NYC Fresh Mozzarella Pizza. It will take you to heaven, and you'll have trouble getting back, because the mafia don't like to let people out of heaven once they send them there, and the mafia do - obviously - own Luigi's.

You may have seen it in Adam Sandler's ""Big Daddy"", or if you have a particularly ""Big Daddy"" then he may have gotten big by eating Luigi's. I don't know.

Also, Luge Pizza is popular with Bobsled teams everywhere.

So why is Luigi's the best in NYC? It's hard to say. The dough is absolutely perfect. It's crusty and delicious and heavenly. The Fresh Mozzarella cheese all over it is sinfully delicious and creamy. The tomato sauce is spiced and delicate and perfect. The herbs really make the pizza. I'm not sure what they are but the combination is wonderful. The slices are huge, they're fairly priced, and they crank them out all day from lunch time until late evening.

I think you should order the ""Mambo #5"", it's amazing. Oh wait! No, that's at Loubega's Pizza. Never mind. Follow the path illuminated by the moonlight and try a slice of ""Luna's Pizza.""

My food tour friend who is addicted to Pizza, says this is the best slice in NYC. Seriously, if you only ever try one slice in NYC, other than the aforementioned one in Queens, this would be the one you'd have to try. It's better than any slice in Manhattan or the Bronx, and even though it's not as wet or sloppy as some, the taste is wonderful. It's the quintessential NY slice and every soul on the planet (who likes pizza - and even some who don't) should come and try Luigi's.

As an aside, I think the pop music scene should take the advice of this pizzeria and ""Lose-iggy."" I mean, pretending to have a Memphis accent just to sell records... meh.

Oh and to finish up the story from earlier, Toadstool left Mario because he was cheating with Rudy, and ended up with Luigi. You can often hear them fooling around after closing if you pop your head in the door. Let's just say that dough is not the only thing they're making at Luigi's.",0.0
"I came here for a work lunch and the people in the office said that it's hard to find good food in Midtown so we ended up here since it's considered one of the better places. We came around 12:30 on a Wednesday and I was surprised to see how crowded it was--almost every seat was filled and the place was definitely bustling. I felt like the spaces in between the seats were a little cramped, but then again it's NYC right. 

They have a pretty extensive and expensive menu. We tried the chips with (blue?) cheese and the deviled eggs for appetizers and I got the tagliatelle for my meal. The chips and the deviled eggs were pretty decent but nothing to rave about.

The tagliatelle is interesting. It's black pasta which is interesting since I thought it would be squid ink pasta but it's not described as such so who knows? It has sauteed shrimp that tasted alright (though I ended up getting food poisoning later that day and I can't tel if it was from this restaurant or a later one?) Anyways the tagliatelle noodles themselves were really firm and chewy which was good. I didn't love the dish because I found it to be on the heavier/creamier side. It was interesting because they diced peppers into it giving it a nice tangy zing to spice up an otherwise dull creamy sauce. I guess if you were in the mood for that kind of pasta it could have been good. I wasn't a huge fan though.

tldr; meh it's obviously super popular but I really didn't think it was anything fantastic?",0.0
"I came here last night with a group of people to watch our friends performance. Upon our arrival, the bouncers, hostess, the woman in the coat check was very hospitable. The laid back decor , with an artsy twist was aesthetically pleasing. The prices of beverages and tickets were affordable. 

Now, to the reason why a four star review turned into a two star:
The blonde bartender on Saturday evening at 7pm was extremely rude and unprofessional. I ordered a Bud Light on tap (I never do this but the beer selection was limited). My glass was dirty, and my beer was skunked (something incredibly wrong with the tap---I asked for three opinions. One person almost became very sick upon tasting this American delight).  

When I wanted to send back the beer, I was trying to be understanding, and approached the bartender in a very kind way (she was not very busy because she texted on her cell phone afterwards). She said. ""OK OK JUST WHAT DO YOU WANT"" snapping and interrupting the customer. Although she gave me a new bottle of beer, I was taken back. I thanked her kindly (after the abrupt response), and she walked away. 

Five minutes later, a gentleman ordered a drink. He did not tip the bartender. She demanded for a tip. He explained that he tips at the end because he was going to be at the venue for the entire show. She wouldn't allow him walk away without a tip. He was probably humiliated in front of other customers. She actually shouted after him. 

The bands were great. Like the cozy atmosphere. I left to go somewhere else for drinks just because of the service. Needless to say, I would have loved to watch the rest of the show that I paid for. I would have been an excellent customer (as well as the six other people I was with that would have spent a lot of means).

Excellent customer service is EVERYTHING.",0.0
"I'm always amazed how the food shopping experience in NYC can make people hyperventilate. Food poisoning! Antitrust! Price-gouging! The Yelp reviews for FoodCellar read like last week's National Enquirer.

To me, this is an upscale supermarket that offers a pleasant shopping experience -- spotlessly clean, nice merchandising, good selection, and helpful employees. Coming from the UWS, the prices are about what I'd expect. Sure, it's a shock if you're moving from Kansas, but really, Dorothy, you'll get used to it. This is the store you'd find in the Emerald City -- bright, shiny, and a little bit magical. It'll cost you a few more nickels, but not a witch's broom.

Once you come to terms with the thoroughly typical NYC prices, you'll find a lot to love here. Prepared foods are gorgeous, and you can eat in or take just outside to Gantry State Park. There's plenty of organic, non-GMO, frou-frou stuff, plus a decent selection of packaged goods with all the preservatives and artificial colors you grew up on. Plus, they do a great job of offering interesting, little-known brands from local and regional suppliers. I think that's cool.

Keep up the good work, FoodCellar. If some of your neighbors are shocked and appalled, that just means shorter lines for the rest of us.",0.0
"In life, certain experiences are guaranteed: Puberty, diarrhea, masturbation, marriage  (therefore bachelor parties), sex, taxes and death...just to name a few.

When facing the crossroads at one of said life experiences (coupled with being a man), you MUST follow protocol. It's a damn right of passage. 

With that being said. Two places you will likely end up when having a Bachelor Party in NYC: Keens Steakhouse & Nearby Stripclubs.

Why you ask? Because it is always wise to start a Bachelor Party on a high note and end it in the gutter. 

For example: Enjoy a high end, dry aged, 2lb cut, $100 piece of charred meat before heading out to see a stage full of $20 young meaties with daddy issues. Lets also not forget the huge list of Single Malts and fine wines they stock before you drown yourself in PBR's.

Wait. 
What does this all really have to do with Keen's you ask?? 
They give out FREE VIP passes to the Stripclubs for the young men that choose to dine with them on those special occasions. 
That's what is REALLY IMPORTANT HERE.",0.0
"I seen the subway advertisement and as much as I love the prices at stop & shop I thought i'd give it a try! I was excited to use the website that actually wasn't that bad and is true to the cheap prices at Stop & Shop (probably the only reason it gets the second star)

I ordered Sat afternoon and placed my order for the 4-10pm shipment time slot  the following Sunday as I would be home all day. I get a automated call that Sun morning that the order is delayed for 2 hrs I expected it would come a little late no big deal right? :(  At 10:15pm I get a call the driver is running hours late they hardly apologized and just transferred me to customer service to schedule another day (they did refund shipping cost which was nice).  

Next day I get yet another email that the shipment is again running hours late -___- I mean the store is less then a few miles away!
I get the order 30 mins late with missing items. I wouldn't be so upset if the items weren't my meat products! the thing that is most heavy to carry from the actual store.

Oh and how could I forget how horribly packaged the items were my detergent spilled into my food items..sighs.. If I wasn't sick I would have trekked it out to the actual store.

I would be hesitant before ever ordering through Pea Pod again they need some major improvements for the Bayridge brooklyn area atleast!

"I have been hitting this Starbucks every day for nearly 6 years. And with 4 others, equally convenient from my office, why do I choose this one? In the middle of tourist hell midtown Manhattan? Because the staff is amazing. This morning I walked in, quite sick, and just from the sound of my congested voice Sacha recommended a green tea for me instead of my regular coffee, and told everyone that I was sick. Before I left, just about every employee at the store took the time to tell me to feel better. It's just nice. Even when the staff turns over, they tell the new employees, ""That's John, he comes in every day, and this is what he gets..."" and every day, it's ready for me, and I am greeted with a smile and good energy. Yeah the line gets long. Yeah the space is crowded. It doesn't matter to me. I'll glad wait the extra few minutes to get treated like that. Especially since Carlos, Laverne, Dillon, Sacha, Gloria, Joel, Lavon, Danny, Kenny, and the rest of them often have to deal with lines out the door, people who can't speak English, rudeness, tight quarters, spilled drinks, and everything else that comes with the territory. I love this place. If I ever change jobs and relocate far from here I will be sad as hell.",0.0
This place is great well priced and excellent service I usually order there hot wings and fries which comes in a 6$ combo with a drink but it's way better than any chicken spot order I've had and their kind enough not to skimp on the fries and the food is the same quality all times of the day when usually late night meals would usually be leftovers get u sick in the morning food but this place is ok which is.

"DUDE. THIS EFFIN PLACE.

First, I live on LI but work in Manhattan, and I absolutely hate getting food delivered, but my job consists of a few break fascists and my weekends are often busy with fun instead of food prep, so I'm often forced to order online.

This all happened today, mere moments ago. Brace yourselves.

I woke up this morning ""sick as a dog"" (if someone could explain that euphemism to me, that would be lovely). Just a big ol' ball of snot and nastiness. I came into work and decided to splurge on healthy food to try and combat the illness (I've also been mainlining Airborne). Manhattan healthy food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive. My order for this place came to over $22.00 for a burger and a smoothie. Holy expensive stuck up vegan food, Batman.

I ordered at 12:23 and Grub Hub told me I would get my order around 1:50. I gasped at how long I had to wait, but chalked it up to the laws of Manhattan Food Delivery Physics and just continued to sit at my desk sniffling and being generally miserable.

The time ticks by. It is now 2:00. I decide to wait a bit longer and give them the benefit of the doubt. I call at around 2:16 (HOW'S THAT FOR BEING PATIENT, MOM) and a nice but somewhat harried young woman with what seems like an Eastern European accent tells me that my order ""should have come"" and she would wait 10 minutes and call me back to see if it has arrived because ""the delivery guys never pick up their phones.""

UHHH.. OK?

So I wait 11 minutes and call her back, because, of course, she doesn't call me. 

""It's still not there?"" No, I'm just calling to hear your cool accent--OF COURSE IT'S NOT HERE JUST ASK MY GRUMBLING STOMACH.

She then tells me she's going to wait a little longer and call me back, because the deliveryman ""isn't picking up his phone."" This seems like a problematic business model--you have to be able to call your delivery guys, no? What if one of them is kidnapped with a basket-ful of your RAW-some smoothies (you can't use that without my permission, the Squeeze, so don't even think about it)? What will Manhattan's vegans do?! How will you file a missing persons report with the NYPD?

She refunds me the price of the smoothie/shake/raw/fruit/lock of Zooey Deschanel's bangs with a shot of Vitamin B thingy, but I'm still paying nearly $10 for a burger that isn't here, so cool

Anyway, I realize that she is most likely not going to call me back given the recent chain of events, so I contact GrubHub (who was awesome throughout the entire process, thank the pagan gods). They contact The Squeeze directly and I quickly get an e-mail saying my order should arrive at 2:44. At 2:50 I receive a phone call from a gentleman who is a manager (I presume) and he tells me that they lost my order. 

YOU LOST IT, EH?! How do you know your impossible-to-reach delivery driver didn't just pop a squat AND EAT MY GODDAMN ORDER? 

He promises me double of my order the next time I place an order with them--which is virtually useless because what am I going to do with two raw Vitamin B shakes and two burgers in one sitting? Kinda ruins the entire concept of eating healthy if I'm scarfing down lunch for two. 

I ask him if I'm getting a refund and he swears that I ""already did."" I'm all, ""noooooooo I was refunded for the drink, but not the burger.""

I hang up on him because he is annoying and really bad at being apologetic. 

Later on, GrubHub refunds me my entire order and -$24.48 and 3.5 hours of my time later and I just ordered a greasy-ass wrap and two Snapples from the place next door.",0.0
"Fuck this place with a glass shard dildo. I waited 30 min for a mediocre chicken parm. The mexican guy called me, ""boss,"" close to 20 times as he checked in to see the status of my sandwich.

"I was relaxing in my bed at around 6:30 pm and was ready for a nap. My girlfriend came into the bedroom and said, ""BABE COME ON GET UP! WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT; ALL WEEK LONG YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT THE SPOTTED PIG."" After 20 minutes of laying down I got dressed quickly and we were ready to go. 

I had decided to drive into the city from Astoria since the place was all the way on the Westside. Finding parking in this area was truly a mentally and physically challenging task in itself. After looking for parking for 45 minutes we were starving and walked over to the Spotted Pig at 8pm. 

Upon arrival to the Spotted Pig I then met our hostess or host? Sebastian. I nick named him Sebastian due to this Diesel Short Short Jeans, poor attitude and poor customer service skills. I do not know what his real name is but Sebastian seemed fitting for him.  Sebastian told us it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. We figured we were already here. Why not? We heard great things. I put my name down; he took my number and said he would call me. We walked around the city for a little bit and then stopped by a bar called the Dublin Pub I believe.  We got a couple drinks and then headed back to the Spotted Pig. We were hoping that the wait time was better.

At 9pm we were greeted by Sebastian again. He informed us that it would be another 30-45 minutes for a table. His hands were flailing around and I let my girlfriend handle the situation. I was irritated enough already and do not do well in those types of situations. The bar and place were packed!  Every step we went people were bumping into us. Waiters would walk by with food and we were starving. Luckily I bumped into someone I knew at the bar that was also waiting hours for a table. 

My girlfriend would walk over to Sebastian every 20 minutes or so hoping for some good news. Sebastian was quite indifferent and did not seem to care that we were waiting for 2 hours for a cheese burger.  He was unapologetic and was doing an awful job.

We FINALLY got seated at around 10:15-10:30pm. Yes we actually had to wait around 2  1/2 hours for a table!  The quarters were pretty close and we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us. There were a lot of tourists and asshole hipsters there giving us dirty looks. I am born and raised in New York City and do not care about you. 

We got our food at around 10:45pm. We got an order of deviled eggs and chicken liver toast for appetizers which were banging. We both ordered the burger that everyone ranted and raved about. I wasn't really impressed with the burger.  It was just a normal burger; the cheese was a bit too strong. The shoe string fries were normal fries you can get at Outback. My girlfriend said she would have preferred a burger from FIVE GUYS or SHAKE SHACK instead and I agreed with her. 

Over all the food was pretty good but the service and wait time were PUTRID. Sebastian needs a reality check and needs to purchase a pair of pants. I think it's safe to say that all the employees there need one (everyone else was wearing pants). If you want to get a sick burger go to the OLD HOMESTEAD. The Kobe burger is sick. It is expensive but you will get your money's worth and get GREAT service. You also won't probably wait 2  1/2 hours to be seated. 

I finally got home at 12:30am. 6 hours earlier I wish I would have ordered a burger from the Bel-Aire Diner and relaxed in my apartment in my basketball shorts for the rest of the evening.

"Changing my review due to the horrible customer service I encountered today. I've been coming here for a year now since I live directly across the street. I often buy the very large water containers that go in the fridge and have them delivered. 

The reason for this is because I have very advanced bone cancer and have had bones replaced and extensively damaged in my spine, hip, shoulder and back. And I'm currently getting chemotherapy every other week that makes me very sick. I come here because it's hard for me to take the subway to the much farther other supermarkets. If there was anything that I could easily get to I would never come back here again. 

Now I never, and I mean NEVER disclose this, but after being told I couldn't have the water cases delivered today by a cashier who has rung me up for delivery of them before, I decided to inform her. She checked with the manager who also has told me yes in the past and today she said no. I then asked to speak with her superviser who I explained in even more detail why I needed the water delivered and that I physically can't carry them and always have them sent over and his response was basically ""as soon as you get better we have to stop"" 

Now the delivery notice they have says within a three block radius delivery is free. From my front door I can see their front door, that's how close I am. So after being extremely embarrassed by having to explain this to 4 different people, I'm writing it here to warm other people about their horrible customer service.",0.0

"Been here twice so far, once for dinner and drinks, once just for happy hour. $4 beers and $5 margaritas at HH are hard to argue with. The place starts to fill up pretty quickly after 5pm- great mix of people! That said, the service does start to deteriorate as the night progresses. 

The time we went for dinner we sat outside- the hostess sat us quickly but it took a bit longer than we expected before the server came over. They did warn us one of the servers had called in sick, though. Anyway,  the grilled shrimp over salad was delicious and the rack of ribs came with quite possibly the best mashed potatoes EVER. (Luckily my boyfriend shared!) Tip for outside- bring bug spray, as a week later I am still healing up from the mosquito bites I got! 

Sitting at the bar for HH yesterday brought a very different experience. (No mosquito bites!) Interesting and friendly patrons, good bartender (Steve), inexpensive drinks. No food this time. But as I was waiting to pay, some other employees were doing something to the cable box which, in turn, made me wait a while to pay, since they were blocking me .

"What a poop show of an experience. The best part of the meal is the wine, bruchetta, and ethan ( the waiter).  

Our waiter, Ethan, was amazing. He was so accommodating and so kind. He deserves a raise. He is such an asset to Fishtag. 

The wine we purchased was the Pinot Grigio. We liked it so much we got two bottles. 

The ambiance is cute and friendly. it is chic with a modern twist. It was very nice. 

The food: 
Shrimp bruchetta: this was delcious. Worthwhile and worth getting. Unique flavors that mesh together. Not that I would ever come here again, but if I were to I would order the bruchetta. 

Ceviche: good and decent. Not worth the cost, but not bad. 


Branzino: both grilled and with the cheese. The cheese branzino was better than the grilled one. Nonetheless, both were dry and unimpressive. 

Mussels: DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted terrible. Not fresh or properly cleaned at all. Public Health should come to check out the mussels and how the mussels are handled. I am sure it wouldnt be approved by the public health department. Every time I think of this I get sick. Waste of money. 

Talapia: The quinoa was decent. Fish was dry. 

Banana brule: Good solid dessert, but apparently they only serve this for restaurant week. 
Panna Cotta: Another complete miss. Lavender was too strong. I wouldn't ever pay for this. What a waste of money. 
Icecream: Caramel, Dark Chocolate, and Bananna. All three were good with strong flavors. Not worth raving about. Nothing special. 

Total Cost for 6 people: $332.

"Oh my god. Hair of the dog.
I don't know why I like this bar so much, but I do. When I'm really trying to wild out... hair of the dog.

It's not as out of control and frat boy infested as 13th Step but still ridiculous enough.

- The crowd is young, lively, and mixed
- Bartenders are friendly and good at their job
- prices are reasonable and during the week they have specials and what have you. Last time I went on a Tuesday it was something like $4 everything at the bar. Works for me.
- Solid music, good mix between Top 40 and old school
- It does get very crowded, very quickly after 10pm on Friday/Saturday nights but still always a very good time
- Also, even when it's crowded, waitresses are still really attentive if you're sitting and ordering at a booth. Basically, these people know how to deal with a crowd.

That being said, you'll either love it or hate it here.

2- When the veggie burger came to my table. I saw that had a weird texture and color, so before doing a big bit. I touched it with my fingers and tasted a bit of it OMG!! It was old and acid vegetables. THEY MADE THE VEGGIE PATTY WITH EXTREMELY OLD EXPIRED VEGETABLES!!! I don't know how the waitress knew already because she came to my table and she felt embarrassing and told me ""do you want to order something else instead. "" I already have gastritis if I was gonna eat this burger I could go to emergency room right away. With expired poisoning food :(

3- So I ordered a chicken grilled sandwich to give it a 3rd chance now. Meanwhile the entire stuff was starting at me the cooker and the rest of the stuff  like they already knew that they are doing something wrong.

4- The grilled chicken came with a burger bun instead the typical sandwich bread. Seems that they just replaced the veggie patty and put the grilled chicken on the same bread. Also the salad was not fresh. The way they cut the vegetables  of the salad looked like if they take old salad from previous customer meals. And put it to the next customer. :(

5- when I left the the waitress was feeling so sad and embarrassing  for everything happened. So we talked I asked her "" what happened to this restaurant? before was so good and fresh food""I grew up in this neighborhood and I'm a totally a supporter of local food places. The waitress told me that she is new, and that many customers are telling her the same about the resultant, bad food.

6- when I was talking to the waitress the owner got into our conversation. And I told him what just happened and he got mad at me. I asked him ""the chef is new? And he answered me in a bad attitude ""the same chef"" I don't think is the same chef when I was 4 years old.I come here with my grandma and my parents. And I just wanted to tell him to take care of his restaurant because our neighborhood is getting gentrified with new brand chain restaurants. And local (moms & pops) restaurants are getting kick out. If he doesn't change his mind soon his restaurant will have to close and to give that space to IHOP. 

7- And last I'm sorry but I will never come back to this restaurant. I'm afraid that I can get sick with expired and used food. I'm going to warn all my friends and family members. Bye bye Hudson View Restaurant :(",0.0
"Possibly the worst lunch I have had in ten years. How bad can mussels with fries be? Anthony Bourdain recommends only eating this dish at restaurants you trust. I used to trust this restaurant. Nevermore. I have eaten raisins that were larger and more flavorful than these mollusks. When I sent the dish back, I asked the waitress for the menu so that I could order something quick while my lunch partner worked her way through a (delicious) omelet. I never saw the server again until my partner was finished. No apology, no offer of anything like a dessert or a drink. Nothing. At least I didn't get food poisoning. With all of the quality restaurants in the Lincoln Center area, why throw your money down the toilet at this dump? Unless you enjoy having bus exhaust blown all over your food from the tourist buses rounding the corner at 63rd street every 10 minutes.....",0.0
"this place is definitely a step up from the last days of its predecessor, the Mark Twain Diner: where some of the servers looked like they were on a work release program from some out of state penitentiary.  In contrast, this place is clean and welcoming. It has a standard diner menu. There is parking available. The food is as expected for a diner. Quality is good - nothing has blown me away, nothing has made me sick. It is a decent diner. I prefer this place to the Jackson House lately, but  I also like the Buccaneer because they have online ordering.",0.0
"!!!PUBLIC HEALTH WARNING!!!

I was in here two days ago to get a sandwich. I placed my order to the guy behind the counter who after taking my order, turned around and continued to handle and slice raw chicken that was on the counter. He then tossed the chicken aside and began to gather the components of my sandwich, WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS OR CHANGING GLOVES.

He opened the glass case with all of the salad ingredients and took out the breaded cutlets and lettuce I had ordered. Touching everything with his gross chicken gut covered hands.

He opened the bread case and handled the rolls with raw chicken guts on his hands.

This is when I stopped him and left after explaining why I no longer could eat there.

I never thought That I would see this happening, I am utterly shocked to think that anyone in the food industry would be so dangerously careless and embarrassingly unprofessional.

Please for your health do not eat prepared foods from this deli, stick to the lotto tickets and cigarettes, anything else may get you sick due to blatant unsafe food handling practices.",0.0
"Used to love their food, but I went there 2 days ago, and some hispanic guy was serving the food. He said Yvonne is sick at the moment. I asked for a small oxtail. I was baffled by the fact that it was $8. Got home, tasted the food, it was gross! I guess it's because she's not able to do the cooking at the moment?! Will give it another try when she comes back. Really dont want to give up on this place",0.0
"Food is not labeled properly,  employees are clueless/obviously untrained and dont give a crap.

I gave up on smoothies here a while ago because they took forever and were never made right, but kept coming for rhe pressed juice thats premade. 

The last time, i wanted to try a pre packed salad and asked if there was vinegar in it. There were many employees behind the counter, one was having a loud conversation on his cell, another couple were joking around and it took me a while to get anyones attention to pay despite me being literally the only customer there. 

I was told for sure there was no vinegar in the salad. I told him it made me very sick and i cannot eat it, and was reassured no vinegar. 

Got home, salad is loaded with vinegar. There goes my dinner and $11 down the drain. 

I went back a couple days later, told them. No one cared. I asked for a manager, there was not one there and no one knew when a manger would be there. I asked for a refund, they told me they couldnt give me one. 

Again like 6 employees there, no one had a clue and no one cared. Messed up.

Im not allergic to vinegar but it makes me violently throw up after ive eaten it. If a food store has this little regard for customers, it can be dangerous.

I had the Philly cheesesteak and I have had diarrhea all day. I drank a lot of beer last night but idk. Anyways this place has a lot of history and it gets ratchet after 4am. Two English tourist women tongue kissed each other for a free pastrami sandwich last night around 430am on 7/26. Was anyone else there? Anyways it's fun but kinda overpriced. Be careful with the cheese steak also.,0.0
"So walking around TriBeCa with the family, I was still hungry after my foreplay meal at Buvette. Now my initial thought was to go to Pearl Oyster Bar but they were closed unfortunately. Back to the drawing room. Then we walked past Keste and remembered the name. Needed to know.

First off, you know this is a legit Neapolitan pizza establishment. Everyone in here is speaking Italian. Always a good sign. We were limited on stomach real estate so we wanted to choose carefully. We decided on the Keste and the TIrolese.

Keste. Tomato sauce, imported buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto di parma, arugula, gran cru, extra virgin olive oil. The crust is like a pillow of bread, the sauce and the imported BM; sick. I would recommend eating with a knife and fork because the arugula/prosciutto is added after it's sliced. So, to avoid those moments of ""oh, no I just murdered all the meat""; do that. Absolutely delicious, simple with high-grade ingredients. I later realized they placed #22 on the 101 Best Pizzas in America list.

Tirolese. Homemade mozzarella, speck, porcini cream, white truffles, baby zucchini and extra virgin olive oil. This was very tasty just a bit rich for me. It sounds yum and I can guarantee you that it is but just a bit powerful IMO. 

I would love to come back here again and try some of the other items on the menu. Thank you for a awesome pizza Keste and giving me another reason to come down to TriBeCa.",0.0
"Oh!

My buddy and I were feeling quite adventurous one night and strayed away from our regular spot, Taisho. 

I'm not sure why this place has worse reviews than regular Taisho. 

The menu is identical, and forgive me if I'm an ignorant yakitori sampler, but the food is identical as well. 

This review generally applies to both Oh! Taisho and regular Taisho. I hope they open a 3rd store called Go! Taisho

This place has a great selection of skewered innards, including but not limited to hearts, gizzards, and livers. There's really not much to complain about, the food here is fantastic Japanese comfort food. But this is coming from someone who is neither Japanese nor comfortable. 

I love their grilled unagi roll. As if unagi rolls aren't great enough as is, they grill it! 

I am also a huge fan of their salmon carbonara. I usually hate fusion dishes, but this one is as smooth as a salmon swimming upstream. 

Highly recommend their soba yaki with pork belly as well. 

Wabasi squid got me kickin'. Evenly balanced with a nice wasabi punch. 

Asparagus with a sick mayo/masago dipping sauce... MM! I'm not sure if I liked the asparagus more or the masago mayo. This dish usually fulfills our greens quota.

This is not a place for those with weak hearts and thin arterial walls, but the food here is sure delicious. 

A couple of suggestions:

- Yelp says they open til 6 am, they do not. My drunk stomach was not having it (literally). 

- Usually mad crowded, and we were told that we can't get a full size table unless there are 4 or more in our group. But we usually order for 4 or more even when it's just the 2 of us. The table space is never enough.

- Service is... meh. They are busy, I get it. 


I'm usually here on Sunday nights! Come by and let's get a 4 top table together and I'll tell you jokes.",0.0
I used the groupon and it allowed for one appetizer and two entrees. I have to say the first time I am disappointed in a groupon restaurant!! The decor is very dismal and unattractive. I ordered the Thai calamari and it was like eating rubber bands. For entrees I tried the curry lobster and Mongolian beef. Where to start... The lobster meat was shriveled and old... Bad sign when there are no fresh lobsters displayed in a lobster restaurant advertising fresh. The Mongolian beef had a horrible smell and the beef was so poorly prepped it was like eating old socks. Then the table next to us ordered some pasta that made me sick to my stomach which such a retched smell.,0.0
"I came to Shaka Burrito twice. The first time, I just had chips so it was okay and I was in the SAFE ZONE woo! The second time, which was today I had the Wakaiki Quesadilla.!!! OMG. Soooooo gross! I cannot apologize to my tatsebuds enough. This so called quesadilla tasted like straight up B.O. gym sweaty socks from a weightlifter who drinks protein shakes and eats egg white every day. I felt sick to my stomach. I cannot understand why the cheese tasted so sour in my mouth. The chicken had no flavor, the bread was chewy and thick. When I lifted the first quesdilla, a pool of GREASE dripped down my arm, slowly but steadily reminding me of how bad this must be for my body. The salsa it came with, also tasted like B.O. wow. Don't come here! I gave it a generous two stars only because they have a good drink selection (acai drink and yerba mate). yum! But another complaint I have, is the MUSIC. The atmosphere of Shaka Burrito is too surfy for me. I was in a pretty bad mood and I was stressed but they just have to play Bob Marley. It made me mad because I hate reggae. Even though Shaka Burrito is a close and affordable option for me, I will not be walking through those doors again! Please take my advice, after all, I am a Yelp elite.",0.0

Also kudos for the manager that was pretty helpful on solving an issue we had with tickets for a previous show.

"Im more of a ice cream guy, but once in a while Ill go for some frozen yogurt.

If I had to choose one place to go to it would be this one!

Why do I say that? Quite simply, everything is done with a love for good yogurt.
Its not one of those do it yourself froyo spots where you press a button and yogurt diarrhea comes out into your cup, then get to weigh it like every other spot.

One reason I like this ""company"" is because of its selection of changing flavors. I had watermelon cilantro last time I was here, and was able to get the perfect hints of everything. Even that tang of the yogurt wasn't overpowered by the sugar, which is commonly done.

Anyone who enjoys frozen desserts should check this place out. They seriously make everything in the back!",0.0
"As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was in korea. They blasted a lot of old school korean songs from the 90s, which was a little too loud for my taste. They have lit up lights all across the walls, hence the name ""starry night"". It's a good place to go to if you and your friends want a casual night of drinking and eating korean pub food. Servers are pretty nice but you kind of have to call them over if it's busy. 

I got the pork and cheese dish, which comes with pork on bone with mozzarella cheese dip. It was really spicy but the cheese evened it out. Perfect dish to go with your drinks. I suggest you to go with a lot of people and order other dishes too because just eating the pork and cheese dish was kind of sickening towards the end. 

Definitely give this place a try if you're into super koreanized atmospheres!",0.0
"Manager's Special ""Revenge Carpaccio,"" I wanted to have my clients experience a ferry ride from Manhattan, then walking through Williamsburg, in the end fine dining of Brooklyn. Although we were late for 15 minutes, a female receptionist at Reynard pleasantly greeted us (a party of 15). The plan went through smoothly until we faced a table. The table was narrow rectangular, one side 6 single chairs, the other side bench seat, both ends each have single chair. I let my clients seated, I realized there was no room for myself. I asked a waiter to add one more table, so that I could seat. The handsome waiter told me that the restaurant only had 12 seated table, so I had to squeeze in at the bench seat. I seated at the corner, but I did not have my own room to have a plate right before me. My elbows were jammed with next if I got closer to the tight corner. The narrow table was about 24 inch wide. Four people (including myself) were seated at the end, in the space of 24 inch by 12 inch. It was not enough room to keep four sets of plate, wineglass and silverware. Next to me, there was an empty 2 seated table. I asked the waiter to bring a manager. A mid 30's smiling Caucasian female manager came and told me ""I'm sorry it's Saturday night, the restaurant is all booked."" I told her ""you see my tight corner and four of us can't dine here, please add a table."" She said again ""unfortunately we do not have a single table within the vicinity of restaurant."" I was annoyed by her saying and not helping attitude. I told her (I should not have said it) ""I'm happy to dine at the bar."" Some around me had already sensed dark cloud forming. She became muted and then had the waiter to take an adjoining table to connect the end. I thanked her and I was happy until our main dish act. It was professional moment, when three waiters served 14 main dishes in a matter of few seconds. They were all inline by an orchestration of the gifted manager who held a grudge. My main dish was only missing. I waited for 15 minutes seeing all the waiters looking away from my empty plate. Rest of my group ate half way through, a short-haired (they're all handsome) male waiter came smiling and told me that he was sorry the chef forgot my dish. So he gave me a complementary dish while my wait. It was an ordinary carpaccio, two slices of white raw fish meat, sprinkle of diced red & yellow pepper and a thin line of green sauce. Unlike a meal at a hipster restaurant, it looked improvisational, the color placement was rather immature Jackson Pollock composition. To tell you the truth, I was still not realized that there was a hidden message on the plate, ""Revenge Carpaccio (or Sashimi)."" The female manager was decanting a bottle of red wine across my seat, she then sipped pleasantly with her associate as if she enjoyed rolling sweet liquid on her tongue. I tasted one piece of the meat. At first it reminded me of that the texture of ""raw Shirako"" which is a Pollack testis (it's considered as a precious ingredient in Japan), but there was no flavor of Shirako (it should be salty and melt right away on a tongue). Raw Shirako is 75-82% water and 1-5% of fat. And I did not buy that a hipster restaurant like Reynard practices such a rare ingredient here in the US. Next moment I pictured that it could be a slice of slug (I've never eaten a slug but my intuition ringed a bell). I carefully spitted out the meat in a napkin and I made sure that my clients did not notice it. My brain was on alert that the dish could be a Revenge Carpaccio. The waiter was again smiling and finally brought my main dish after 30 minutes delay. I refused to take it because most of my clients were done and I've already lost my appetite by the speculation of hideous organized effort I could not get rid of from my mind. The waiter said ""I apologize the delay, if you don't eat it, you can share it. I'll leave it in the center."" Funny, nobody touched the plate. The fact is that I did not get a diarrhea for the sake of owner Andrew Tarlow (Marlow & Sons, Marlow & Daughters, Reynard, Roman's, Achilles Heel). However I was in discomfort for a couple of days thinking of the meat and their tactic (I admit that I am writing this review in order to straighten my experience at Reynard in Aug. 15). Delaying and isolating 1 guest's main dish from the rest was a coward act of the restaurant. Instead of admiring its décor and ingredients, we chewed at implications of deceit and subterfuge from the hipster norm ""vanity and arrogance."" After all it was scary, spooky and loathsome 90 minutes business dinner, paying off a thousand of dollars on dining cost, plus 18% service charge, a grinned smile and a handshake from the manager when we left. The bottom line is that, a party of 15 cannot be seated at a table of 12, even at a hipster restaurant like Reynard. Reynard should have turned down a reservation when the call was made, due to its incapability of accommodating more than 12. It's simple as it is.",0.0

"This is not exactly my kind of bar when it comes to entertainment value, but it has plenty of perks depending on your needs.  

Sick of spending 12 dollars for a shot of Johnny Walker Black?  Well drop in here, pay half the damn price, and truly enjoy a sloppy drunken night at the right price.  It doesn't hurt that there are plenty of cabs nearby to escort your drunken ass home.

The bar is dimly lit, with a few tables on the corner that are hanging on for their dear lives to balance properly, and a dartboard hangs on a nearby wall. It's a great way to be a total dick to one of your friends with a swift throw of a dart into his or her ass checks.

There's an outdated jukebox midway into the bar, but it has enough songs in there for you to recite lyrics by Ginuwine or Backstreet Boys.  That could upset the music because... Well.. It's an Irish pub.  However, it does grant you the freedom to make it your night.

Right by the jukebox is a bathroom that ain't the prettiest a thing but gets the job done.  No pee on the floors or toilet, or maybe I was too buzzed to notice.

At the very end of the bar is a pool table that I once regrettably screwed up.  You remember Lebron James's signature ""powder"" move at pregame? Well I once did the same thing before I began a game with friends and didn't realize Id make all that damn powder sprinkle it's way back down and cover the table like a white desert. Anyway, there are good times to enjoy with the pool table. Very little to no waiting.

This bar is never packed, and it has been around for quite a while due to my understanding.  That means it's pretty old school and likely has its traditional and local customers.  From time to time the crowd will vary, but the occasional creepy characters do stand out: The man or woman who's nasal voice and yellow teeth suggest years of endless cigarettes.. or the odd couple...a short white man in his mid 40s in crappy attire embracing a tall young bald asian women wearing roller blades.  Then there are people like me who speak, sound, and look at least relatively normal and want to drop in for the simple pleasures.

I've mainly dropped in here when I wanted something a bit more low key and cheap.  The bartenders have always been nice and will happily make a special drink at your request.  Definitely a neighborhood spot. I give it 3 stars because you pretty much make it your night.",0.0
"When this restaurant first opened, they would have had a 5 star review from me. I had organized a party there within a few weeks of their grand opening. The food they put out for the party was unreal. Huge sushi trays, beautifully arranged hot dishes that looked like artwork. The food just kept coming out. All of my guests kept raving about the party for months afterwards.
Then the ownership changed. Quite ironically, someone had purchased me a gift card for my birthday and the very next day. I went in to order a bunch of dishes to go. When I went to pay with the gift card (that had literally been written the day prior), you would have thought I was trying to steal from this woman at the desk. She explained to me that the ownership change had occurred on that very day, and my gift card was written by the ""old owner"". She almost wouldn't let me redeem a day old gift card, but eventually she did. So my husband and I decided to give it one last chance. That was the day we were given brown tuna, and when bringing it to the manager's attention, we were told that the change in color was due to the fish being defrosted, and then refrozen and thawed out a second time because it hadn't been used right away!! What a great way to get food poisoning!! The roll went right in the trash! Never again!!!",0.0
"If you like...well; I was going to say, if you like hot garbage, this is the place for you.  Except our delivery arrived ice cold.  

However, it was garbage.

Sesame Chicken lunch special - it was special all right.  Special as in leavings from a batch specially made the day before.  What wasn't simply gristle tasted old, and reeked of ginger.

Hot and Spicy Soup - had a visible layer of grease floating atop the container.

Sweet bean paste bun and Meat Bun - hard in places, clearly old; with the pork bun having an off taste.  That one i'm keeping in the freezer, in case the one bite I took actually gives me food poisoning.

This place used to be a reliable decent order in - no longer.  And check the other reviews (wish I had before ordering);  it seems mine isn't the only experience with old or possibly 'recycled' food.",0.0
"TL;DR
-------
The food was okay, but too expensive, management skills are poor, customer service is meh.

The Experience
------------------
So I arrived, and I'm hungry like usual wanting to try something new. My friend Yelp'ed out this place, and so we decided to try it out.

I went in and it looks okay busy, and so, I went to take in a number. These solely assumed ""cashier"" staff aren't even listening to me as they were busy bring the checks to the customer.

The frustration happens here

I know that the restaurant wants me to eat here, but they shouldn't have told me the wait time was 20 minutes, because I ended up waiting for 45 minutes until my friend got sick from the starvation.

Talk about management skills

The staff told us that the available table only has two seats available, and that the next available table was around 5 minutes. So I stood there and waited.. and waited... until I ran out of patience.

Five minutes to a minute, over and over again. I'm like, ""Are you damn serious, making us wait an hour when you said 20 minutes?!"" in Cantonese.

And finally, we got our seat, but my best friend's girl went to the bathroom cause she felt nauseous after waiting for such a long time. How do you even make someone sick for waiting! LOL.

Time to fill my tummy

Food was decent, but way way way too expensive. A medium fish bowl for $60 bucks, and two extra appetizers cost another $10. Well, at least the egg for my sauce was 50 cents!

I ended up finishing the entire bowl of fish, but didn't even get started on the hotpot yet because everyone was full. So I called for the check.

Kissing my greens goodbye

The bill came out to a wopping $70 dollars, and my best friend wanted to leave. I wanted to pay 5% tip, but the staff were just ""stupid"", not unresponsive.

I wasn't really suprised about the bill, but I think the prices are just there to cover construction costs and rent for now. So, nice try guys!

I'm not sure if I am coming back, but this restaurant needs improvement. I mean, lots of it. At least don't lie to me about the wait time. Shesh.",0.0
"This place was packed solid when we went there on a Saturday night - you could tell a lot of Romanian families go there dressed up for a night out.  

The appetizers (salad and fried cheese) were ok, and they basically gave you a whole loaf of bread for the table.  The entrees looked amazing when they came out - my mother-in-law got a stewed chicken leg with polenta, my husband got a skinless sausage with fries, and I got the Romanian stew with polenta (one side had cheese topping and the other had a fried egg).

Unfortunately, just like several other previous reviews, my Romanian stew was cold.  Not just ""it got cold"" from sitting out - it was obviously from frozen/refrigerated and heated up by microwave.  The flavor was actually REALLY good, but after 3-4 steaming hot bites, the meat in the middle was literally ice cold.  I had them bring it back to reheat.  They obviously just put the whole plate in the microwave, as when it came back, the cheese was totally melted/rubberized on the polenta and the egg was practically hard boiled/rubberized as well.  I took another few bites and it was the same thing:  one bite was piping hot, and the next was lukewarm at best.  I gave up and just ate the polenta and egg - and the egg had an egg shell in it!!

At this point I just had to stop altogether.... I'm just glad I didn't get sick.  I really wish I could have given this place a better review, as everyone else had a great entree.  The service was ok and they were apologetic about the cold stew, but this is obviously an ongoing problem and food poisoning waiting to happen.  As an experienced microwaver, all I have to say is this:  stir the food around halfway through microwaving and it will be fine. 

Otherwise, it was decently priced for a good selection of food.  Also, they don't take AMEX.",0.0
"I am so off diners.  We switched to T-Bone from Tower because of 2 bouts of food poisoning with Tower and a couple of really poor judgements on pricing.  Now, after spending a mint with these guys, I try to order a delivery from T-Bone for my 2 kids and they said, sorry, we don't deliver kids meals because I don't know if you are telling me the truth that they are for children.

"Sick good! These are arguably the best tacos I've had in the United States.

The tortillas are as fresh as they come, you literally see a woman pounding out the little flat sheets of corn joy with a little hand crank adjacent to the grill. 

The toppings are plentiful and neatly presented buffet style on the counter.

The meats are juicy, fresh, flavorful, perfect.

My only complaints, which I would gladly tolerate to get my hands on these any day, are the lack of seating/counter space for eating on the scene as well as the relative lack of more adventurous meat options found at really authentic taco places (stomach, skin, tongue, etc). Parking is hard to find in the area if you have a car, but it's worth the trek.",0.0
"I love Chipotle, but the experience here ruined it. I've never had problems at this location until this one time when I went to redeem my free burrito bowl. I made the mistake of ordering extra meat which was not covered. The manager frowned at me and acted in the most unenthused manner. 

I watched in horror as he proceeds to discard the entire burrito bowl that was not at all contaminated at all. What a waste!   Not only that, he starts a new bowl for me with the smallest scoops of ingredients possible. 

The BOGO promotion is supposed to be a win win situation for both sides - but this horrible experience left me with a sick feeling in the stomach and a lost appetite. I'm definitely not coming back to this location again because I want to throw up being reminded of that awful day. =***(",0.0

"FINALLY got to try their famous burgers and truffle fries!  It was my first time ordering medium rare beef and as promised by our highly enthusiastic and charming waiter, it really brought out the flavor in my [original] burger ($11)!  It also made the burger very soft and juicy but not bloody.  My new favorite!!

Our fries ($3.50) had the fondue cheese glazed over the middle.  They were good while warm but eventually got really hard afterwards and was annoying to eat especially since they were so thin.  I don't think I'll get them again.  The truffle flavor is strong and gets sickening halfway through.

We ended our meal with some dessert.  Their dessert menu is a really cute small chalkboard.  We ordered ice cream ($3.50) and they came out in cups of 3 scoops each!  My friend had the Mexican Chocolate Chip and I had the Sea Salt Caramel.  The flavors were bold and the ice cream itself was the melting-in-your-mouth and softly-bathing-the-taste-buds kind of smooth.  I felt like I was eating caramel candies with a subtle (wished it was stronger) dash of salt.

I was facing the wall but according to my friend, our waiter was being really cute and happy.  He would break out in small dance moves to the music playing overhead.",0.0
"If negative stars were an option, that'd be my choice. I went in yesterday and can tell you my exact  purchase: almond milk, bananas, blueberries and raspberries. Everything was fine until I went to use the raspberries and was shocked to see them covered in a thick white coat of mold on the top. I went back expecting understanding and humanity, there was a mistake. Even though it had be only 1 day, they insisted I need a receipt. Even though they've seen me patron this location for years, they insisted on having a receipt. Even though they were standing in front of a POS where they could scan the item and see that it was sold yesterday with the exact items I listed, they insisted on a receipt. It's this dehumanization that I loath when these people are robots who only believe in policy over passion. All I wanted was raspberries that will not give me food poisoning. I feel like that is a reasonable expectation for $4.49

Khim's with their many convenient locations and great inventory lacks any sense of humanity and neighborhood vibes that you can find at any number of more pleasant healthy delis in the hood. For the nearest one to this location, I'd recommend 359 Graham AKA Graham Garden where they'll treat you with respect. 

Unable to find my receipt, I'm biking back over there to leave the rotting fruit with them since I have no need for it. They were truly rude. If you like rudeness and strict adherence to policies, this place is for you.",0.0
"I've only been here once so far but will definitely going back. I got the spinach and cheese ravioli and decided to try some of their marinara. The raviolis were delicious. I'm a big eater, so the ravioli was either two big dinners for me, or three smaller meals (maybe a dinner with some salad, and then another time as a side?) The marinara sauce was awesome, I shamelessly licked the excess sauce off my plate. I will definitely be going back again soon. The woman working there was so friendly, really feels like a family and friends run place. I'm no connoisseur of Italian food, but I grew up on it, I've been to Italy twice, and this stuff is legit.

"Three strikes and we are out of here!

Strike #1.  Driving to this place is like driving through obstacle course. Please fix your driveway!!!

Strike #2.  When we came out of our car and our noses got hit with this rodding nauseating smell, we should have turned around and left, but we decided to proceed inside.  

I have to admit they were busy, but come on, we are in 21st century, credit cards should be accepted everywhere.  Well, at least they have ATM that charged me $2 fee.

Strike #3.  After i asked our waitress, how was soft crab sandwich, she told me people love it.   I grew up eating seafood all my life and i know when it is not fresh, no matter what batter or spices you will use to mask the smell.   I almost got sick after i squeezed ton of oil from my crab and final strike was no words to described smell and yellow goo coming out of my crab.  I was trying not to vomit while i was there.  

Our waitress didn't come up once to ask us how our food was.  One busboy did ask me if we enjoyed everything.  After i said no he just said that he was sorry to hear that and that was the end of it. 
 
I did not make a scene, i just wanted to leave and never come back. Our dinner for 2 came out to $70 no alcohol.  

If you want good seafood go to City Island!!!

"Got sick of reading Kim's review every time I saw it because it contains blatently false information. First off, the liquor store is the cheapest in the area, and it has a good selection of liquor and a decent selection of wine. Gnarly Vines is the best liquor store in the immediate area, but it's a bit more expensive. D&M Pratt Liquor is pretty similar, but slightly more expensive.  The very best liquor store within a short driving distance is BQE Liquors, which has a fantastic selection and is much cheaper than anything else in the area. But you need a car. 

As for the proprietor's treatment of ""blacks in the area,"" all I can say is that the many (too many) times I've been in there over the last 6 years, I've never seen any of the salespeople behind the counter being disrespectful to anyone of any race. Never.  So I'm guessing this person had a really bad experience, but it's pretty lame to make a huge generic statement like that on the basis of that experience. 

The inside is not what I'd call nice. It was clearly designed for a period in which there was a lot more crime and/or violence in the neighborhood, because the whole thing is plexiglassed over like it's in a war zone. I'm guessing they needed that at some point. But compared to a new store, like Gnarly Vines, it gives you a snapshot of how the neighborhood has changed (for the better.) 

And yes, the store has a $20 credit minimum. Big deal. Buy two bottles or bring cash.  Geez.",0.0
"We made reservations for 5 for the ""kamayan night"" at Jeepney. One of our friends got sick and couldn't make it that evening. There was nothing on the menu or on the website that stated that if some of your party could not make it that you would have to pay for that any way. So we ended up paying another $45 for that one person that could not make it. It's $45/person for ""kamayan night.""
The bartender tells you that they have a special drink. The drink was delicious, but just make sure that you are aware of the price. A ""pinay colada,"" which my friends ordered was $25. The prices for cocktails are just ridiculously priced $9+ and it wasn't really that special. I've tasted better. 
If you want a once in a lifetime experience using your hands, then Jeepney is good for that, but other than that, you can go to Queens to get your Filipino food for less and the food is more delicious. We waited almost 40 minutes for our table to be ready even though we had reservations.",0.0
"Like a true degenerate, I found myself hung over/still drunk/starving at the same time. At 9:30am. On a Friday morning. 
Naturally, my partners in crime and I all call in ""cough* sick to work, and start brainstorming food options. And...how we settled on ""meet at Hill Country BBQ at 11:30"" is besides me.

Well since noone cares about my sob story, here's the gist of it. They don't open til 12, so DON'T show up at 11:30 and ask to be seated. Yeah...

As much as Hill Country is over-hyped, not the best in the city, blah blah blah...the whole experience is just fantastic. It's not meant to be a fancy sit-down ""gourmet"" barbecue experience. It's served the way it's supposed to...like they do in the South. Get the mac n cheese, have some brisket if that tickles your fancy, but DEFINITELY get yourself a heapin' pile of ribs. Wash it all down with a cold Shiner, and we're in business.

Going during happy hour is the best, as the tacos are a bit on the pricey side ($3+/ea).  Or the 3 tacos and rice and beans for ~$10 is a decent deal.

String beans are not supposed to be the color of baby's diarrhea and the texture of the mashed potatoes-they have to be bright green and crispy, not mushy.

"In a word, disappointing.

Don't expect Tsampa anymore.  The lovely little Tibetan Restaurant has shut its doors and new ownership has transformed it into meh.  No discernible cuisine at all with a minute menu ranging from tortellini to crab cakes to curry.

The evening began awkwardly, as a table of two were asked by staff to shift over to accommodate our group of three, pushing two tables together and completely interrupting their meal.

They presented free, fresh edamame, which was a nice alternative to bread or nothing.  That's about all we liked about this place.

I made the mistake of ordering the linguini with clams, which was abundant with garlic and lacking in flavor.  Several udon (not linguini) noodles were undercooked and, amazingly, others were a little burnt.  The moment that completely disgusted me was opening a nearly closed clam to find it filled with something I can only describe as black mush.

Our appetizer came with the meal and it was halfway decent: pumpkin dumplings.  If only the rest of the food was similar to this.  There was still something a little off about the dumplings -- my friend observed that they were overstuffed, which leads me to believe that they are still learning the ropes on cooking.  Not exactly what you want from a restaurant.

Service was almost non-existent.  When we were clearly finished, our server did not present the check until I called her over in the spot where she was standing.  Our water was refilled frequently by an older man, but even that lapsed at the most important time of the meal.

It's rare that I don't enjoy a meal in NYC, but this place is definitely on my do not return list.

"Me and my girlfriend came here some time ago in september 2014, after i got off work around 11pm. Had a nice atmosphere, dim lights romantic, so i thought it would be a nice spot. Boy oh boy was i wrong. We came in to get a bit to eat, and also so i could grab a beer before heading home, but my girlfriend got sick (vomiting) and ended up having to use their bathroom. Other people using it could hear her clearly and asked management what was going on. after that a bald caucasian man who i believe was a manager approached me about what was going on with her, and i explained to him why we were there, where we came from, and that she had gastro intestinal issues. She didnt even come to drink whatsoever. He left me alone for then and when she came out she ended up going right back in. Now hes getting frustrated when i approach him at the counter for a beer, he denies me my drink and tells me to make sure she wont be in the bathroom much longer before i sit down and have a drink. Once she came out she turned around and went right back in, so he comes over and accuses her of comming to this bar already drunk and that its bad for business, resulting in telling us we need to leave. I decide i need to get out of there before i loose my cool, so we head outside and i call us a cab, where she got sick again and headed back inside to use the bathroom. The manager yet again comes hounding me outside, raising his voice at me like i was his child, Hence the reason for this review. We werent under any influence except hunger, came into this establishment as civilized people and got treated the way we did. So please people stay away from this place, i would never show my face in there again, trust me.

"Friday night dinner tonight was horrific. The food was amateur and the entree had some kind of hard thing in it that felt terrible on my tooth. They charged $49 for maybe $3 worth of ingredients, I would guess. The woman who worked they seated me with my back of head next to open stove burners. I have long hair and hope to keep it that way! The only other place to sit was in the walking area. The woman next to me are like a boar chewing with mouth open and devouring her food, the guy moving plates around was crashing them noisily into the sink. When I remarked about the hard object in my entree, I was offered a free dessert. What?!!! The entree itself lacked cohesiveness or flavor. It was almost sickening the pesto something or other dollop carelessly slopped in a mound of quinoa. It all felt overly stirred and handled. I ate bc I was hungry, but it was like going to your brothers house and eating his wife's food and she's a terrible cook and the home is not clean and you worry that she might not have washed her hands, or something like that. Perhaps just a bad night, but I won't be back. Ps when j was leaving and telling the woman that I did not like that she sat me next to the burners, her response was that nobody else has ever complained. Nice!",0.0

"My boyfriend and I went there last night after hearing great things about other locations.  I never write reviews but felt compelled to after eating there because I thought it was one of the worst meals I've eaten in NYC.  The one good thing was the pork buns but they weren't THAT great - they were great compared to the other things we ate which were horrible such as the scallops - couldn't even eat them; lobster rice was so greasy it made me feel sick after; the special short ribs included an over easy egg and fried romaine lettuce with greasy bread crumbs - terrible - the texture was gross, the amount of oil they used was unnecessary; the watermelon potato salad was pathetic - 4 thin slices of watermelon with a couple chunks of potato salad - it was really random and they took the term ""small plate"" a little too far.
The drinks were $15 each and the bartender couldn't even fill the entire glass - either use a smaller glass or give us our $15 worth.
I was shocked when we got our bill and it was over $200.

"My boyfriend and I were excited to finally try this place. After hearing so many wonderful reviews about their spinach gnocchi, we were really look forward to eating it. 
Came here on a really humid summer day and was disappointed when they didn't have AC or good-working fans (ceiling fans did nothing). However, we didn't care because we were certain that the food was good.

My boyfriend was set on getting the gnocchi. I wanted to get a different dish, but the reviews convinced me to get the spinach gnocchi, so we both ended up with the same dish. 
The food didn't take long to come. First bite in, I immediately noticed that the gnocchi was realllyyyy soft. At the first bite, after tasting the flavor, I understood why people liked this dish. HOWEVER, this dish didn't do it for us. We got so sick of the flavor after a few short bites. I would've liked it if they had some sort of meat in the dish. I couldn't finish it at all, I left a lot on the plate. My boyfriend couldn't finish it either. It just didn't taste amazing to me. I was very disappointed. The reviews made it sound so amazing, but it was just mediocre to me.
I got tired of the cream flavor so easily, as well as the soft texture. I regret not getting a different dish. 

There were very few customers in the restaurant and yet it was hard to spot down the waiters, because they seemed distracted in their own conversations and they were following each other around. We asked for the check for the first time, one of the guys said okay, but it seemed like he forgot because we never got it and we had to ask for it again. They also didn't bother to check up on us during the meal, seeing if we needed water refills or asking if the food was good, like other waiters are supposed to do. 

We felt horrible wasting the food, so we decided to take it to go. Later that evening, we cooked up some sausages and tossed it in with the pasta to finish it. It tasted better because we had a different flavor/texture to eat it with, but it didn't make it completely better. We still got sick of the flavor really easily.

In the end, we were disappointed. I guess we shouldn't trust so many positive reviews sometimes.",0.0

Oh my god. 1 waitress works on the weekend. Weekends are the busiest especially since it's by the seaport. Bartenders are slammed!! We sat down and not a single waiter or waitress came over for 20 mins...got sick of waiting so I decided to get the drinks for me and my friend at the bar. The bar was so backed up it took the bartender 20 minutes just to acknowledge me...in the meantime my friend still didn't have a single wait staff come up to them. The bald headed manger was on his phone instead of lending hand and being a productive front of the house. This place has outdoor seating too and that takes just as long! I asked ordered a pretzel and it came out cold. Really? We waited an hour for drinks and a cold pretzel which I fetched myself? And no you're not in a soft opening. You opened last summer. You had the outdoor Biergarten across from you and you had Ambrose. I live in the neighborhood. Try to bring in more local residents with incentives on weekdays. Try holding events like trivia nights and maybe you'll have a local following instead of tourist trash.,0.0
"Went two days ago with 4 other friends for my friends 22nd birthday. We had a Groupon for unlimited drinks and brunch for 4, so one of us paid for his own meal, which he said was worth it.

When we came in, we were seated promptly and were greeted by the most friendly kindhearted host. Although the place is cramped, we were seated downstairs at a cozy booth and found the surroundings comfortable and relaxing.

We started drinking almost immediately. There were mimosas and bellinis, and the peach bellinis were honestly way better than the mimosas, which were very strong and took us off guard. 

Big extensive menu, and we spent our time looking at everything. The burgers and salmon plate were a $2 charge extra, but between the 5 of us we had 2 burgers (which really do come with buckets of fries), a salmon plate, eggs benedict, and the breakfast polenta. It took about a half hour to get our food, which is reasonable for a Sunday at 1pm.

Okay so the whole time we're waiting for the food the drinks keep getting refilled. VERY FREQUENTLY. 

Our food comes, everything is delicious. Really genuinely delicious, no complaints from everyone, and cleared plates. Even when we accidentally broke a plate, the waiter was just a doll, and so kind to us.

By the time the food was eaten, the birthday girl was fucking shitfaced. Drunk and nearly unconscious. 

She got sick all over the table, and I hauled her into the bathroom, and we spent about a half hour in there, during which time the staff were the most understanding, friendly, and strong stomached I've ever encountered. True props to these amazing waiters and the cleaning staff. 

So the restaurant was fantastic, the food was great, the service was great, but the drinks were potent and came quickly before we had food. This kind of justified when the host said as we left that they ""see this kind of thing all the time"", referring to my sick friend. I don't think any restaurant should have a large amount of drunk and sick patrons, to the point where they're used to seeing them leave totally off their asses. 

Since it would be embarrassing to return to the place my friend repainted, I won't be going back anytime soon. But I recommend that if you go, have the breakfast polenta and GO EASY ON THE DRINKS.",0.0

"I don't like how you can't pick your meals.  I'm not a picky eater but some recipes sounded way better than others but I was stuck with whatever they picked. You can't even tell them if you have food allergies or absolutely hate a certain food item. We HATE eggplant and were sent a recipe with that being the main ingredient - so we were stuck with a meal we didn't like.

These meals are NOT beginner friendly - FYI. I would consider myself a seasoned cook and some of the recipes still confused me and had a lot of steps to them.

I DO like the convenience factor, the recipe cards were nice and well put together, they give you a lot of food. I had an issue with delivery for my first package and customer service was very helpful.

Also I sent 3 meals from BA as a gift to my parents after my Dad got sick. My Dad just  told me that he had to put in his credit card info in order to redeem the gift. I think that is just wrong.

"I've never been a dim sum kind of gal.  Fish is not my favorite*, I once got sick from an order of dumplings**, and, I don't know, I guess Chinese is just not my preferred cuisine. So despite the fact that I work in Chinatown and I have several friends who love them some dim sum, I've managed to stay away. 

This past weekend, though, I was tossed back in head first to the biggest baddest dim sum party around: brunch at Jing Fong.

We were there for a Bridal Shower and the bridal party very wisely made reservations for the group weeks in advance.  I felt bad for the dozens and dozens and dozens of people waiting outside for their number to be called.  There had to have been a 100 people outside blocking the sidewalks of Elizabeth Street.  Upstairs was no different.  So many people, so many tables, so many waiters pushing so many carts full of so many dishes of food.

Here's a sampling of what we had: 

- Shrimp Rolled in Bacon.  I'm so not a shrimp person- but this was gooood. 

- Steamed Pork Buns.  Ahh sweet bbq'd pork.  Super delish. 

- Beef & Broccoli.  I hate broccoli so I pushed that aside and dove into the beef.  Cut really thin but busting with savory flavor. 

- Crispy Fried Chicken.  It's fried chicken.  What more do I have to say!?


In addition to the good food, the staff was great - our server didn't waste any time clearing old plates and bringing out new ones.  And the decor is lovely - who doesn't love grand twinkly chandeliers?

The only complaint I've got is the noise level.  The room is so large and there are so many people that it was impossible to hear the person next to you... which made playing bridal shower games that much harder.  The random announcements were a bit strange too... we couldn't tell if they were calling guests to be seated or what.  It was loud and a little annoying.

Despite the noise level I had a great time at Jing Fong and am totally encouraging everyone to go and experience a Dim Sum Sunday Brunch, such a unique dining experience.

Wonton in spicy sauce- Wonton's were very nicely made. It tasted fresh and homemade. The sauce was just a chili-oil and soy sauce.

"Alright listen, this place is almost perfect. the atmosphere is reminiscent of a Johnny rockets five guys love child. its very homey, service was perfect and the menu was insane. so i bet your wondering, why did you give this 3stars?

short answer, food poison. my friends and i ordered a burger each. one medium, one medium-well, and one well done. The medium was rare and so was the well done burger. medium well was fine, but i have to question what were they thinking when. they was cooking. The toppings was on point, but i would have preferred more toppings instead of the taste that they gave me (personal preference) 

In conclusion, for a place called ""cheeseburger cheeseburger"" the burgers are pretty average. the drinks are very good tho. watch out for red meat",0.0
We went in to this bar because my friend had explosive diarrhea and needed to use the facilities. My poor chum discovered that the toilet cubicles come without doors in this establishment and given the urgency of his below the waist wrongdoing he had to empty his bowels in front of any and every patron of the lavatory. Said patrons proceeded to laugh at my friend's toilet tragedy with the surly barman. The lesson: don't shit here.,0.0
"DOOOSH BAG HQ

I'd rather have violent diarrhea for 2 weeks straight than go here, again.

My friend suggested we take some out of town guests here; makes me thank god I'm out of this phase of my life. Everything about this place was pretentious, and overpriced. I think we got charged something like $800 for a bottle of vodka. At that rate, just go get a handle of Svedka and a hooker.",0.0
"This place just needs to be recognized and appreciated for all it has to offer. My bf introduced me to this place abt a yr ago when he took me here for my bday dinner. For some reason we never returned but this past sat we were having a serious sushi craving. We rediscovered this place and just enjoyed our entire dinner experience. The place itself is tiny and I could see it getting crowded very fast but during both of my visits I did not encountered such issue. 

First of all, the sushi rolls are delicious, fresh, and addicting. On top of that each roll is only $3. With a lengthly hh during the wkends noon-7 and 3:30-7 during the week. I think that it is just amazing to be able to indulge in fresh, yummy sushi for that price! No fear of getting food poisoning. Also, $10 pitcher of beer! Why, yes thank you don't mind if we do take advantage of all these deals. 

Finally, I just have to add that they have a curtain covering the door in order to prevent the wind from entering every time the door opens. Why am I letting you know this? Keep in mind, the place is fairly small and to consistently have cold air rush in every time the door opens can be so frustrating. I just felt that it was essential for me to let you know that they have their entire business under control. Go check it out!!",0.0
"We had relatives in from out of town, and for a party of 11 adults and 4 children under 7, I was skeptical, especially when I saw that yelp said they were not kid friendly! 
I called for a reservation to see what they had to say about kids, and they were more than welcoming on the phone. So, I asked for outdoor seating in the shade, and when we all arrived we were seated, and really enjoyed our meal in a super convenient location, almost adjacent to 2 great play grounds, and plenty of free street parking on the Sunday before Labor Day. 
Food is really good too. I'm not sure what a gourmet foodie would say, but my Cobb salad was fresh, interestingly seasoned, and as a New Yorker, my most important barometer- nobody got sick. 
A kids menu is available, and at 11am, we could get the pix fixe menu or  ala carte, so everyone was happy, and in my family, that's not easy. Our waiter was busy, but was around for coffee refills, and checking in. 
And my Bloody Mary was delicious. 
There was a jazzy band playing for our listening pleasure, and conversation was still possible. 
And to top it off, we used four different credit cards to pay the bill, without any fuss.  We were not rushed to leave, but the sun moved during our meal, and the shade was gone.  So, no dessert, but we all left having had a memorable experience.",0.0
"I woke up with a sore throat and stuffy face. I was sick, so someone who cares about me took me here. We started off with the oolong tea. It was perfect. The waiter brought me a glass of water with ice. I asked him to bring me water with no ice, to which he kindly obliged. T

The soup came out. It was great. My soup had half an egg with a soft yolk, a large to medium size sheet of seaweed, spinach, shrimp wonton and some Ramen noodles in chicken broth.

The broth cleared my sinuses well. I felt better after the tea and the soup. 

I think my favorite part though, was the toilet. This toilet was a Cadillac of toilets. It had heated seats, two speeds of butt washer and a dryer.

This was a great little joint. Had a great time. The service was good and so was the soup. And the toilet.",0.0
"Been to morimoto 3 times in my life and I can honestly say that I was never impressed with the food. It was always just so-so. I never get sushi here since I don't really see this place as expert in that arena. The decor/ambience is always awesome but I really don't love the tightly spaced 2 seater tables. If you don't get an end seat, forget about having a ""private dinner."" People sitting next to us on both sides asked us questions and chatted for a bit- no complaints, but just saying- need a place to ""talk"" without anyone hearing what you have to say? Forget this place. 
Anyway, the bathroom is always a trip- love the endless window look. 
The toro tartare was perfect as it's always been- but go easy on the condiments box. I've seen people get sick after eating that on two different occasions. The scallop was great - sauce was very Asian-fusion. We were planning on going to a second dinner, so we got those two as apps and then had the seafood toban yaki. Comes out steamy on a nabe and it smells like seafood heaven- but eat it fast before it gets cold. Smells a bit fishy if you don't. They could also use a bit less salt- the extreme saltiness was a bit too much for me. I had three drinks by the time the night was over- starting out from the bar downstairs. The bar is cute and it's always empty, so not a bad place to stop by if you're in the area and don't want to be in a clustered bar.",0.0

"This place is terrible.

My first clue that it wasn't going to be good should have been the fact that there was no wait on a lovely Saturday afternoon when almost every other place in the area had lines out the door. My second was that we waited a while before we even got menus.  

I had the mac and cheese and my husband ordered the sliders. The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it was from a box. In fact, if it had been Kraft that would have been an improvement. The sliders were barely cooked and when cut open the middle was raw. The waitress didn't seem all that concerned with the potential food poisoning issue and after taking the plate away she disappeared for quite a while. 

They took the sliders off the bill but even then two iced teas and the mac and cheese still cost almost $20. There are plenty of places in the area to eat so I'd recommend choosing one of them instead of going here if you're in the area.",0.0

My miso stir fry was good also, but a tonnn of onions again.  I had to pull apart half of the meal to get the onions out :(

There were quite a few people so we went to get pommes frites before coming back to order. 
The portions so big I was really full, however it was not what I expected. The sauce was awesomeeeeeeee it was amazing. The takoyaki balls were just...a soft chewy doughy thing with a piece of octopus in there, after two balls I was completely sick of it. The okonomiyaki just tasted like cabbage and flour.

"Stella 34 Trattoria is a clean and modern styled restaurant on the sixth floor of--this is happening--Macy*s. (I know.) I was initially a bit afraid of the restaurant choice but let me say, IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!

Love the ambiance--it's extremely refreshing! Amidst the chaos of shoppers, piles and racks of clothing, and--did I mention--shoppers. No really, tourist shoppers who blindly veer into walkways while looking in every direction but the right one. It's like being in Times Square where they are all looking up and drifting as they walk and, if you're really lucky, stopping out of nowhere. THAT (that = hellish chaos).

And then, whew, air, breathing, it's not a mirage--Stella 34 Trattoria.

Already worlds happier than seconds before, the night's experience continued to climb up and up.

To start, we had a few vegetable small plates to share. Not only were they super delicious but they were presented beautifully.

The plating of the food stayed much in the theme of the restaurant, there was a lot of white with vibrant pops of color. The white dishes emphasize the rich color combinations within the dishes, each one looking exciting and enticing--you just have to dive in!

Once you do dive in, it's incredibly flavorful. Clean and flavorful. By clean, I mean every ingredient stands out in the right way--with purpose. It's impressive.

The dining experience at Stella 34 Trattoria quickly turns from pure enjoyment to curiosity over every item on the menu. Each item that we ordered was so good it made me want to try all of those dishes that I ruled out in the decision making process. (I suppose that's what brings people back to a restaurant. But in the moment I felt like a four-year-old having a tantrum because I want to eat more than I know I am capable of and would result in getting sick. I literally almost ordered a pizza after finishing my meal because my grandmother's looked so delicious.)

Beyond my obsession with the food plating, style, flavors, and overall deliciousness, is the service. THE SERVICE IS REMARKABLE. From the moment I entered the restaurant and was greeted, I knew I was in for a proper evening.

You see, I was offered a table before the rest of my party arrived. I was also given the option of enjoying a drink at the bar, or relaxing in the large lounge. When two more members of my party arrived, they were directed to the lounge--""there is a pretty girl waiting for you in the lounge""--I believe that she made a note of my location in her system. (fabulous service and compliment--too sweet!)

Wonderfully, that type of service extended to our waitress Sam. She was truly fabulous and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. She was able to have fun with us in a completely professional manner which only added to the exceptional experience that we had at Stella 34 Trattoria.

And then there's dessert (yes, I'm back on the food. And while I'm there, my ""Tortino Di Melanzane"" was excellent. I want it again right now as I drool over the photo I took of it). THE DESSERT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DINNER! It's composed and thoughtful--just look at those textures, yum.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEING TOO PREPARED--AND STELLA 34 TRATTORIA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS IT! Shopped too long and don't have time to cook for the family? Just don't feel like sitting down to a meal? Like a moth to a flame got pulled towards the lit display case filled with deliciousness?

Yes, they have it all! Not only do they have a prepared food section--I know, ""not only""--but they have a gelato counter, too. Amazing. Take it all with you--no fuss, no muss. What a perfectly thought out experience! I can't wait to go back. CHEERS!",0.0

My friend got some kind of egg merguez sandwich that was also tasty. For dessert we decided to push our stomachs and get the Chocolate Bread Pudding With Whipped Cream.

"I will say right now I have not been to a Pizza Hut in 20+ years! let alone some sort of pickup type Pizza Hut type place. Today on the way home all I could think of was pizza and the building was right there. Maybe the stars aligned but I figured how bad could it be.  I pulled over and then proceeded to review Yelp. Holy Yelp this place has some stinky reviews, but far be it from me to not commit to this endeavor. What's the worst that could happen....throw it away, get food poisoning. This visit was screaming at me and I listened.

There was one man in front of me ordering and thank god, because I have no clue what Pizza Hut is even serving anymore. There was this picture of what I would call a flower pizza. It's a pizza with all these little petal like edges. How cute is that, I want that cute flower pizza. It's actually called the Cheesy Bites pizza. You can get lots of different flavors of your cheesy bites, but I just stayed with the original flavor.

The counter person that took my order was nice and smiley. She asked me if I would like to get the cookie for an extra charge....well yes I would. Then she tried the up sell on the 2liter drink. No thanks on that. She said it would be 15 minutes. Ok, no problem there. Order place at 4:47 and I was in the car driving away at 5:00. Under time, score Pizza Hut.

I did not so much as peek at what I had just bought. The drive home was brutal. The smell of this pizza was everywhere in this car. I could not get home fast enough. That cookie thing was sitting on top of the pizza and I was so tempted but I waited. 

I finally got in the house and was able to see the vision of smell which was screaming for me. I was going to wait for ""G"" to get home but my hunger got the best of me. I pulled one of those cheesy bites off and could not believe how fantastic they were. I had eaten four of those bites before ""G"" got home. They had this Parmesan coating with some garlic salty undertones.  It was crust you would never throw away. They need to make trays of these cheesy bites from heaven. 

Now it's time for pizza eating. I have to say, the only issue I had with the pizza was the bottom of the crust. It is not crispy like most of the places we order from locally. The Pizza Hut pizza has a buttery crust. The rest of the pizza was very good. Perfect amounts of sauce, cheese and pepperoni. It was hot and tasty, and those cheesy bites were created by some genius. 

The service was pleasant,the inside of the place was clean. There are only two tables and a four chairs per table so this is a definite pick up place.

There is this strange sneeze guard thing at the ordering counter. Not sure why unless it's to maybe deter robbery. Parking was not a problem. The problem will be keeping your hands out of the pizza or cookie box before you get home.

Oh, I forgot to talk about the cookie. It was good,really warm and good. Definitely get the cookie.",0.0
"I've been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for awhile now because it is one of a few in the area that serves gluten free pasta. I ordered delivery and after eating some of it, felt like something was not right and called to ask whether they did, indeed, send me gluten free pasta. They did not. When I asked the woman on the phone for a discount or refund because I was already getting sick from the regular pasta she said she could not because ""it comes out of her pocket."" She did tell me that she would put the bufala mozzarella (that I had originally ordered but never gotten) on the new pasta for free. Great, I got $4 of free cheese and an afternoon of felling ill. 

The sad thing is that the food is actually not bad (WAY too overpriced though), but with that kind of disregard for customers, no more of my money will be going in to their pocket.",0.0
"3.5 Stars

After much consideration, I am giving Charlie Bird a 3 star rating.

What we got:
-Fusille Negro with Crab
-Roman Artichoke
-Cauliflower
-Bone Marrow
-Tuscan Chicken Liver

I enjoyed the artichoke and the bone marrow the most. Both were very flavorful and delicious. The crab pasta was just okay. I prefer the crab pasta at the NoMad--that is one of my all-time favorite dishes. The cauliflower was WAY too salty--I've said it before and I'll say it again, If I find something salty then there is a problem because I love salt and would gladly add soy sauce to just about anything! The chicken liver was okay, I am finding myself not enjoying liver as much anymore, since I had food poisoning from goose liver in Budapest. I hope to overcome this aversion soon.

I had been looking forward to the uni pasta and was bummed to find they weren't offering it any longer.

The bartender was highly skilled and would definitely suggest just letting him take the reins. He will mix you up something amazing so trust him! If you like wine, they have a lot of interesting bottles and Jason, the wine director, really knows what he is talking about.

I never had an issue until yesterday when I ordered a ""vegan tofu scramble."" I have enjoyed tofu scrambles at Atlas before, but this was honestly gross. It looked like a pile of ""vegan chicken salad"" (eek) with two slices of ""vegan cheese"" placed on top. About 1/4 of the way through my meal, I thought ""this tastes a bit too off,"" and asked the man behind the counter what was actually in it. He showed me the package of cheese and it was not vegan (it contained milk protein). I felt sick to my stomach.

Service: This gets an A+ We were very well taken care of from beginning to end. Seated at a table we requested on the spot. Our dinner service was prompt and very friendly, water replenished consistently. 

Dinner: First things first, you MUST order the Carciofini FrittiFried aka Artichokes & Lemon. This appetizer was mind-blowing. An excellent start to our meal and a wonderful dish to share with friends. 

The only salad on the menu was the Radicchio and it was lackluster. I'd suggest you put your money towards something else on the menu.

I ordered the LumaconiSausage, Kale & Black Truffle. Delicious but very rich and maybe a tad too salty for me. The portion is just the right size, anything larger and I might have felt very sick. I tried a taste of the SpigolaSalt-Baked Sea Bass & Funghi Trifolati and was very pleased with those few bites, another dish I would recommend. 

Dessert: We ordered the CrostataCranberry Tart & Apple Gelato. It was fine but a sad conclusion to our very fantastical meal. I would probably have stuck with just the gelato. The tart was good but maybe something I would have had just as a morning snack.

"I had the dubious pleasure of being served a truly disgusting burger at this joint a few weeks back and have no intention of ever repeating the experience. 

Some pals were getting together for a beer after work and we settled on Chaps as a suitably straight forward venue host the proceedings.

Here's how it went down. 

To start with, the selection of beers is pretty poor.  I made do with the mildly alcoholic dishwater they call Coors Light.

Perhaps one of the famed Chaps burgers and plate of fries would set things right? 

Wrong. 

Something told me to ask for the burger done 'medium'. Perhaps it was the slightly odd smell in the place. I'm not sure.  But it seemed like a good precaution and not entirely unreasonable. 

When the much heralded patty arrived it was oozing blood and in the middle it was barely even warm. In France this is called 'bleu'. Anywhere else it's a recipe for food poisoning. I dutifully sent the undercooked offering  back.

This did not go down well with the chef. When it returned the thing had been incinerated.  It was disgusting but at least it wasn't injurious to human health. 

So that's it for Chaps.  Watery beer and a horrible burger. The fries were cold as well.  And a bit greasy.

"Came here last Friday night to celebrate my recovery after being stuck in bed for a week with a fever!  I was so excited because I heard all the hype about the new Applebee's, how fab it was and how huge it was, and their spectacular aquarium with sharks and rays!

Yea... about that,

I really do think they are more expensive than the location on Emmons, not that its so expensive or anything, but that just gives you a hint at how desperate for money they are due to this being in a touristy spot. Anyhoo..

We walked in and were greeted by two SCREAMING hostesses, like honestly what kind of Red Bull have you been drinking all day.  They were just too hyper for my taste.  Like they legitimately freaked me out.  They sat us at our table downstairs at a booth.  

Our teen waiter comes over to give us the menus and he said he would be back in a minute to take drink orders, but I gave him mine at that very instance because I was extremely thirsty. lol

We ordered out meals, and I thought our waiter was having an anxiety attack.  I don't know what happened to him that day, but he was nervous and shaking, I felt so bad.

I was missing my utensils so we asked a different waiter passing by to bring some, and she came right away, A+.

I think they have two managers here, or at least more than one, and once we got our food they were the ones who came over to ask how everything was going so far with our waiter and our meal.

At that point we were alright.

Half way through our meal, I swear they turned the AC on so high that my hair looked like it was blowing in the wind.  We were both FREEZING, like freezing isn't even the word!

It got so bad that I couldn't finish my meal.  So we got a to go box, (which is really annoying and not classy.  Honestly the waiter should take the plate to the back and put it in a box them self, I don't want to finish eating and then have to do that myself, it bothers me.)

First of all, the food there isn't fresh. That asian chick who made my sandwich didn't wear gloves or wash her hands. She made my sandwich right after she touched her butt. I got food poisoning from the sandwich. Don't come here unless you wanna get food poisoning.

Secondly, the coffee there isn't cheap. It is as expensive as starbucks, but it tastes like shit. I had green tea latte, which tasted like water with syrup. I threw it away. I am willing to pay as long as it tastes good. 

Last but not least, the service is horrible. I am asian myself so I know how rude asians are but the rudeness of the asian chick working there was beyond what I can express. She ignored every request I made and gave me an attitude. What I can't take is her attitude. Actually the boss was there but I guess she doesn't care. They don't want your business.

Okay, so I ask my coworkers where I can get some authentic tacos in NYC and one guy said Taco Bell and the other pointed me to a taco truck where they have potatoes and coleslaw and pumpkin seeds in their tacos.  OK WTF. 

 Apparently getting taco recs from people in NY is as bad as going to a mexican hole in the wall and ordering a cheesburger then puking in the back seat of your aunt's car from food poisoning, forcing her to sell her car.  Side note:  sorry auntie..i still feel bad about that.

Any taco place that doesn't sell Al Pastor tacos is a thumbs down in my book.  This place hit the spot and now i know where to go for my taco cravings.  

5 star for New York tacos..but not the best tacos i've ever had so going to have to knock it down to 4",0.0

"My gf took me there recently. Recommended the empanadas and natural juice drink. Place was clean and pleasant to dine in, and service was good. Ordered one chicken and one beef empanada. Not lucky with empanadas as I got very sick in South America a few years ago after eating one. Feeling more confident this time as this is NY and place looked clean. Had only the beef empanada with the fruit juice and took the chicken one home. Woke up at midnight with vomiting and diarrhea. No more empanadas for me ever. Be careful.",0.0
"Sadly, after six months of going to this place 3x per week, I've had to eliminate it from the line-up.  

I typically went for the salad bar in the back, where they'd toss it for you.  The ingredients weren't the best quality, but they were never poor quality, per se.  But last week, I veered from my norm and got their pre-made California Wrap behind the sandwich counter.  Two bites of that wrap completely nullified any loyalty I'd developed fork this place over the last half-year.  

The chicken salad was clearly days old--it was sour and lumpy.  And the wrap was soaking wet--like someone had dropped it into the sink then just re-wrapped it in new paper.

Thankfully I avoided getting food poisoning by not continuing any consumption, but I'm not about to flirt with fire again.",0.0
"This place is a mess.

I waited THIRTY minutes for a fairly simple order--American Classic burger and tater tots. At that point, I don't think you can call yourself a fast food restaurant. I finally had to ask the line manager what happened to my order, which they had not even started. No apology was offered. 

To add insult to injury, when I finally did receive my food, the burger was cold. I couldn't eat more than a few bites because the temperature was so off, I was worried about food poisoning. And it wasn't just my order, a group of my coworkers went with me to get burgers, and they each reported that their food was lukewarm at best. 

Overall, the place is poorly run. There seems to be no coordination, and tickets get extremely backed up, so expect to wait a very long time for very substandard food. I truly question the food safety here as well, as the line manager, who was not wearing gloves, repeatedly had to unwrap burgers and poke around to see what they were before bagging them. Yes, that's how disorganized and unprofessional the service is here. 

Please save your time and money and go to Smashburger, which is just a block away. Actually, you may as well go to McDonalds-- you'll probably have a better experience there than at Uncle Sam's.",0.0
"After hearing about an interracial couple being attacked to the point where they were both hospitalised and that the staff at SHI did not help was APPALLING. Shi should add a"" T"" to the end of their restaurant's name and then it would come off more of an honest name. 46 people will not return because of this.

An interracial couple was attacked leaving a waterfront bar in long Island City early Saturday morning, police said.
A group of three men yelled racial slurs at Jacob James-Vogel, 37, and his wife, Billie, 40, as they left the restaurant Shi on Center Boulevard at 2 a.m. As they began to walk away one of the suspects assaulted the couple, according to the NYPD.
Police charged Nikolaos Katsos, 28, with assault and harassment. The charges could be upgraded, police said.
James sustained non-life threatening injuries to his face. His wife was thrown to the ground when she tried to stop the assault and blacked out as her head hit the sidewalk.
Police are still looking for the other two men.


The other reviews where TWO customers BIRTHDAY gifts were STOLEN by the staff and the manager HELPED to back up the staff and their theft (this included the host and the waitress backing up the two thefts). Warning. DO NOT CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY IN THIS PLACE.

Another person found HAIR on the sushi and several cases of FOOD POISONING.

Should I continue?


The WORST is that this couple was attacked and that SHI (which needs a ""T"" after the name) did not help. DO NOT GO HERE AS A VISITOR or leave after 11pm in the evening. Go at your own risk. But truth be told. DISGUSTING!",0.0
"I walked by this place thousands of times and never cared to pay it any thought. It wasn't until a woman in a funny costume handed me a flyer that I decided to go.... oh how foolish of me. The staff is extremely friendly and the ambiance doesn't get better. I realized there's a sign outside that reads ""Best pizza on (insert picture of Earth)"", and they may not be wrong; this is the best pizza in the area (if not ever) by far, and trust me I've tried them all. It's not like any pizza you will find so the extra $$$ isn't an issue for me, plus I don't walk out of there feeling like I'll get food poisoning from the place (which isn't uncommon in the area O.o).

"I created a Yelp account just so that I can write this review.

I went to eat at this restaurant and was astonished by the level of incompetence I encountered. The food was absolutely atrocious-I think it's food poisoning waiting to happen. The service was terrible-the waitress had no respect for any of her customers and would huff and puff whenever we asked for things. A bowl that she brought over had a nasty piece of dried chicken from god knows when stuck to it. The fried dough that she served to us was at least a day old-it was as hard as a rock.

DO NOT EVER, EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!",0.0
"Cheap Chinese food? Check
Quick service? Check
Mean lady at the register? Check

I get take-out from this place pretty often since it's literally a stone's throw from me. The food isn't great but it's soooo cheap. So if you're feeling too lazy to cook, don't mind greasy/oily food, and want to use the leftover change in your pocket, stop by Maxim Chinese. 

Never got food poisoning and have gotten take-out from here 50+ times

"I hate to have to write this review, but Van Horn earned it last night.

We've been there a few times in the past and liked it- their fish sandwich is really great and I love the mac and cheese. The service can be spotty, and the place is on the pricier side for sandwiches, but overall it's been a solid choice. Buuuuut, my husband woke up at 3am this morning, about 6 hours after eating their pulled pork sandwich, with a nasty case of FOOD POISONING. It was the only thing he ate last night so there are no other suspects.

Doesn't get much worse than that.",0.0
"A case of mistaken identity...

I was at Death and Co about a year ago and had a great time. Unfortunately, I came last night and was not only disappointed but embarrassed to bring family there. The bouncer was actually very nice, put our names down, gave a suggestion for a nearby bar to wait at since they do not allow you to wait inside and didn't want to spend all night waiting outside the doors, and called us when the table was ready. 

We didn't see a server for a good amount of time before someone came. We were trying to get suggestions for drinks which she wasn't friendly and didn't seem to want to. So we tried to give her some food items which she then said ""drinks first""....you can't take a food order first? After putting in the drink order then the food....we never saw her again. The steak tasted like kerosine and the drinks I barely touched. I would have said something to the staff if someone came by the table at any point...but nobody did. At least the mac and cheese  and frisket was still good. No biggie, but here's the part where it all goes sour...

After asking another staff member for the check, we were greated by the manager Tyson who asked my cousin and I if we have ever been there before. I said yes thinking they were trying to tell us something interesting about the restaurant. Instead, I was given a check and told that I am not allowed in the establishment ever again and am banned because of my behavior last week. I was so confused, I had to ask him to repeat what he said. I told him I was never there last weekend and what is he talking about. He proceeded to expalin that his waitress said me and my cousin were there last week and treated her badly. I then explained again, I was never at your establishment last week and hadn't been there in almost a year. He gave a half-hearted apology and said sorry but he had to go with what his staff said. I told him that was insane considering I was not at your restaurant last week and neither was my cousin. At this point, I am so embarrassed. I brought my family to a restaurant thinking she would have a cool experience on her one day off as she is a doctor in Long Island in residency.

I wanted to know who on staff even said that to have them look me in the eye and apologize for thinking I was someone else and making me go through that experience. She then proceeded to tell me 100% over and over and over again that me and my cousin were at this restaurant last week. I told her it's impossible as my cousin was working in Long Island and I was at a baptism in Rockland county. How can you be 100% if you are 1000% wrong, and I have proof I was never there?

I never got a true apology, my character was attacked, my family and I were embarrassed and I had to think whether or not for the rest of the night I was going to have food poisoning or something wrong as something seemed off with the food/drinks (was it spit?). 

I have never been treated like this, the logic doesn't even make sense. I have worked in restaurants for 10 years and never have seen such behavior. If that were true, a.) why didn't you kick me out on first site instead of waiting for us to order/finish food and drinks b.) why would someone come back to a restaurant a week later if they caused such a problem and c.) why would I ask to speak to the server and explain I am not her if I am not her! 

I want someone to contact me back about this as I am still so shocked and upset that I was treated this way.",0.0
"Let me preempt this by acknowledging how odd it feels to have to go against the vast majority of reviews on here, but I also felt I would be remiss not to write up the awful experience I had at The Spotted Pig last Friday. I even signed up for Yelp just to tell y'all about it!

I had only heard great things about the place and had had it on my to-visit restaurant list for months, waiting for the proper occasion to check it out: celebrating my anniversary with my boyfriend was one such event.

We knew there would be a long wait going into it, so we showed up on the earlier side to get our names on the list. We were told two hours (fine, it was Friday night) and that if we didn't arrive within ten minutes of being contacted, our spot would be given up. Fine.

We popped off to a nearby watering hole for just about two hours when I got the text. Knowing that we could lose our spot if we delayed, we chugged the rest of our beers and headed over.

Once there, our boisterous host--who would become the ""star"" of this whole production--informed us that our table would be ready ""soon."" I mean, sure, another couple minutes, whatever.

At this establishment, apparently ""soon"" is applied liberally.

After ten minutes the host noticed that we were whispering to each other and were trying to make eye contact--and she immediately engaged her defenses, despite us never saying anything to her, telling us to ""settle down boys.""

Seriously? ""Settle down""? Aside from the condescending usage of ""boys,"" what exactly were we doing? Having a quiet, private discussion about how we had finished our beers and rushed over so we wouldn't lose our spot, only then made to inexplicably wait ten more minutes?

Another ten minutes passed and were again told to ""keep calm,"" our gracious host offering us two beers ""on me"" (except no, they're on the restaurant), helping make up for the fact that we had been waiting almost 2.5 hours at that point. This additional wait was supposedly because the host was looking for a more accommodating table for my tall boyfriend (he is over 6' but not in an extreme way)--something neither of us had ever experienced before and something we definitely didn't ask for. The host gave another couple--who had showed up after us--a table because my boyfriend was ""too tall"" and she was ""trying to be polite."" Again, we did not request some kind of special ""tall person"" table.

When we did finally get the ""best table in the house"" (according to the host), it was a corner table that was arguably the worst option for two tall people--our knees were knocking together the entire time. Normally who cares! But we were made to wait an extra 25 minutes because allegedly we were being given a better table specifically for tall people.

We were so hungry at this point we skipped another round of drinks and went straight for the burgers, medium-rare.

When they arrived, there was nothing ""medium"" about them; in fact, they were as mushy as a baby's nose (you know, before they've got cartilage in there) and complemented by fries so thin they were practically crushed beneath their own weight.

We made it through about half of our burgers before giving up (I mean, I'm not trying to get food poisoning on my anniversary). Our server (who was very nice, in stark contrast to the host) asked whether everything had not been to our liking. We told her it hadn't, but we just wanted the check. It'd been nearly a four-hour affair by then, and neither of us was interested in extending it any further.

After paying, the host asked how we liked our meal, and I said it was ""terrible actually, and we're never coming back!"" to which she replied, ""Oh, that's too bad""--but I think we all knew it wasn't.

I can count the number of times I've been to a restaurant so well-regarded and yet been so let down on one hand. This was one of those times.

It's been one day so far.... But me and my boyfriend survived. But overall food was okay...I rather go to sake.. Never coming back here to risk my life again

Adding on... I am giving ONE STAR only- even though food was OK and I didn't almost DIE  is because the whole time I couldn't even eat comfortably.. Knowing I could get poisoned. I even avoided ordering any special sushi roll (kinda kills the whole purpose of coming here because I wanted sushi). I was especially careful not to eat any raw food just in case. Paid almost 15 for lunch on the weekend.. I can say I definitely did NOT get my money worth.

"Vomiting should not be considered part of dining out, period. The only reason we tried this nightmare was because Slowteria (an excellent Mexican restaurant one block away) was closed for a holiday break and walking farther wasn't an option. 
Service was 'begrudging', but as we provided our own entertainment we hardly gave it a thought. But really, the food is awful. My wife couldn't bring herself to finish her Beef Tacos, and I wasn't about to suggest taking it to go. 
I was so hungry I finished my Taco Plaza (notice: no fish, as we wanted to play it safe), but four hours later I was hovering over the toilet.

"My husband and I were sick of Asian food so we decided to give this place a try. Located right in the middle of midtown close to our hotel. 

When we got there, I guess it had just opened because we couldn't find the hostess. She came forward a few seconds later and sat us. To me, she gave off this feeling like she really hated her job. No smile, no conversation, just straight to business. It was the same when she took our order. I was glad that the actual waiter came over to assist us the rest of the time. He was friendlier.

We ordered the penne with vodka sauce and the rigatoni with bolognese sauce. Both were delicious. I would say that they know their sauces. My only problem is that the pasta was slightly undercooked, more al dente than I'm used to. It was still edible so I finished it okay.

"For a couple of years this was my go to Chinese food place, however I haven't been in about 7 months.  I had placed an order one night, went to pick it up 25 mins later or so, only to be told it wasn't ready yet; I then had to wait about 50 mins inside the restaurant for it to be done. This wasn't even the bothersome part of my experience. 

The issue came as I had to stand there and watch the staff prepare the food. I had never actually been inside the place for more than 5 or 10 mins at a time. I watched a woman give her nose a back n forth barehanded wipe, only to then use that same hand to grab a handful of broccoli and throw it into a pan. I watched a gentlemen continuously handling cash and then using those same barehands to pick up egg rolls. These types of things continued for the entire 50 mins I was in there. There just doesn't seem to be much concern for sanitation in this place. At the end of it, I had completely lost my appetite. Not wanting any sort of confrontation I actually paid for my food when it was done and left. When I got home I threw my food out and haven't been back since. 



I know this kind of thing doesn't even bother a lot of people, and if that's you, that's great. The food was always delicious, no complaints there. The food also never got me sick. I've had people say to me that this sort of handling of food prob goes on in a lot restaurants, especially Chinese food places.

- The menu advertised caramelized onions, but they did not appear on the iPads. When I asked an employee, she assured me that ""fried onions"" (a different menu item) were the same as caramelized onions (they are not).

"My friend had his birthday party here last night and it was quite the debacherous experience.  

I won't add much to this review that hasn't been covered by others. For approximately $42 (with included tax and tip) you get two hours of all you can eat sushi (and they were serving up to 3 rolls at once),salad,soup and bottomless pitchers of sake and beer. 

The atmosphere is very fratty. It's I want to get wasted before 11 PM, which was quite well accomplished by many of the patrons. Girls stumbling around, check. Said girls vomiting in bathroom, check. Lots of banging on tables as sloppy sake bombs are triggered, check check and check! 

Then why on earth am I giving this place 4 stars..Because you have to know what you're getting yourself into and I thought the service was very good. The waitress was attentive to our large party  and even provided us with plates and knives to cut some birthday cake which we brought. 

The sushi was not as bad as you'd expect for AYCE. I particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna!

It sounded delightful and refreshing on the menu, but it was undrinkable. I don't like sweet drinks, but this one was so dry and bitter I could only choke down two sips. I'm still a little mad at myself that I didn't ask for something else but I pride myself on not being a send it back kinda girl.  So instead I'm a martyr with a craptastic thirteen dollar cocktail.

It was shaped like a heart, covered in a sweet rose glaze, and even had rose petals on top! It was super light and fluffy, and the rose glaze offered a nice little change of pace to a traditional glaze. I don't think it was quite worth $4, but it was a delicious and cute little holiday treat.

My friends also got the rose hot chocolate with the hibiscus marshmallows- this I would pass on. The hot chocolate was nothing special, and the marshmallows were sickly sweet. The hibiscus had a weird flavor that may have been good on its own, but were a definite miss here. I wish they had plain marshmallows instead!

I'm not sure if I like Doughnut Plant as much as my other favorites, but I definitely need to come back and try a few more flavors!",0.0
"Asked for a black coffee, sweet. They gave me a coffee with milk or cream. I walked back two blocks to get another cup. Told them they screwed up my coffee, and the lady asked, ""did you finish it""? To which I replied, ""no I threw it out, I can't drink milk or cream it'll make me sick"". They charged me for another cup, and didn't even apologize.

And on another note...the place is rather small. The have two tables in the back that seats four. Up by the front window is a counter that wraps around the front area so you can stand and eat or drink.

Thanks for the lousy service, and taking my money.",0.0
Loved the atmosphere on this rocking boat/dock area. I wish the swaying motion didn't make me feel sick though. I still have to give 4 stars to the frying pan for awesome atmosphere and decently priced food and drink.,0.0
"Worst service I've ever had. Sat for an hour watching people not eat.  After more than a half hour we were brought runny salsa and burnt tortilla chips. 
Waiter came by and blamed the lack of food on the kitchen then proceeded to forget about us again.  I'm sorry but if you're a waiter you should be following up with the kitchen, its your job to make sure your patrons are taken care of. 
Out if the few plates that were put on the table (empty of food). all showed marks of not being properly cleaned.  
Instead of this dingy looking basement restaurant with a dirty patio out back try another spot.  You'll be glad they're poor sanitary habits didn't make you sick. 
Extremely disappointing way to spend my wife's birthday. 


Don't bother coming here even if you like the menu - you won't get served just disappointed.  

I wish I could give zero stars.

After reading the owners reply I am more dissatisfied.  The filth was not from the falling trees it was from poor dishwashing.  And I did try the sangria it wasn't that great I've never seen sangria with brown fruit before.  If you want your special occasion ruined like mine was then go here.",0.0
"It might be the ""best chinesefood in the west village"" but - don't let that fool you.  This isn't particularly *good* chinese food.  It's not even *good* American-style chinese food.  It's edible.  It's fast.  It didn't make anyone sick.  Food was served prompt and  hot.  That's about all the good I can say. 

We ordered a few things for the table 
Dan-Dan noodles - a little more soy-saucy and less peanuty than others I've had
scallion pancake - crispy and very thin
soup dumplings - a little bland, and barely any soup in the dumps. 

Entrees - family style
kung pao chicken
pork lo mein
salt and pepper squid
garlic pork green beans
beef with broccoli

Again - everything was edible.  There were hints of good - salt & pepper squid / green beans come to mind.  Everything else was just okay.   -- Even the wine (pinot noir / malbec) was just okay.  Nothing was mind blowing. 

If you order a lot and pay in cash, you may just get 1 entree for free.  That's what our waiter was trying to get us to do, but for this party, credit just was easier.   You get fortune cookies at the end too.",0.0
"Walk slow, because you might miss this placing.... I had a coconut fudge ice-cream, which was good. a lot of coconut if you are a coconut person. the real win here is the mocha ice-cream.

"Meh. The desserts in this place are just ok. The crack pie is prepackaged in small cardboard containers. The pie is shown all beautiful and in a complete pie and then you get this prepackaged thing. We took it back to our hotel and tried it.  I love love sweets but this was just so sickly. It was just pure sugar. The other one we tried was Candybar pie and it also was just too much. It was like every candy bar combined into one.

The place is super hard to find, but it's cute, tucked away on a quiet street. We only found it by looking for the actual address. Be warned that this is take out only.  Get your items and head on out. There is no where for you to sit or really to even stand and eat. 

There were lots of different options here and I loved the idea behind so many of them, but the execution just wasn't good. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. 3 stars.",0.0
"Came here with a restaurant.com coupon to burn. There was a $100 minimum so we got appetizers, wine, desserts, the whole thing.

The food was good and the waiters very attentive. The carafe of house reisling was so sickly sweet that I couldn't bear it, but I'm not a wine person and that may have just been me realizing I don't care for reisling.

My boyfriend got a french onion soup and spiced sea scallops for appetizers, very fresh and nicely seasoned. I started with escargot, which was plated not in one of those escargot plates with the snails sunken in but with large, pretty shells in a sea of garlic butter, heavenly, and served with french bread to sop up the sauce.

My lamb chops were way too tiny and there was a little too much salad-to-meat ratio on the plate, but no fault with the flavor on either meat or salad; my boyfriend enjoyed his steak frites.

The real star of the meal was the sauteed spinach I ordered as a side (not realizing that my lamb entree would be mostly salad!) What a surprise it was. I don't know what the hell they DID to it, but it was the highlight of the meal for me. Not kidding. Was it the seasoning? I don't know, but it was like heaven. Perfect temperature, like hot buttery silk in my mouth. Yeah, I really really liked the sauteed spinach. Try it.

Dessert was nice but unremarkable. (Warm chocolate cake served a la mode.)

At the end, they asked if it was all right for them to add an 18% gratuity. I'm happy they asked, though sad for them because I 20% when they don't add the gratuity themselves.",0.0
"*Review for delivery ONLY*

I can't speak to the actual service at the sit down restaurant, but damn they're fast with their delivery.  The General Tsao's I ordered (not very Chinese I know) was surprisingly pretty weak; too many peppers, bland chicken, and sauce that was sickeningly sweet... I could barely get through it... but the dim sum that was delivered was great!  

The pork buns were more like pork bun bites (or vitamins almost) and were nice and fluffy, with a sweet and savory chunk of pork in the middle.  The chicken feet though were the best though; if they screwed this part up, it would've been a minus few stars.  A bunch of chicken feet in a sticky black bean sauce... so good, falling of the bone.  And the dim sum prices are extremely reasonable.

Dim sum for delivery is definitely the way to go here.",0.0
"Yuck on the ""Steamed Bun Sandwich"". They come four to an order. Got 2 chicken, 2 beef.......for which I was charged $8.95. The chicken is one thick flat grisly piece of meat coated in some sort of sickly sweet glaze. It had to be cut with a knife! Not good. The beef was just okay......a stingy portion......approximately one large tablespoon of beef. So basically you're paying for a steamed bun. I'll stick to the Moo Shu Grill truck for triple the portions....and a much better flavor profile!!!!!",0.0
"The pork burrito is the best thing I've had.  I had the tacos (small and arrive cold) and I just had the pork enchilada...tasty - but not as good as the burrito with the slaw etc.  Same price- you get a lot less. 

Do not under any circumstances order the Brownie.  If I were blindfolded I would not be able to tell you want it was.  Flavorless - JUST SICKENINGLY SWEET.   Tasteless - never tasted anything less chocolate tasting in my life.  Waste of calories - I tossed it in the garbage.",0.0
"It was a misty September evening in Manhattan as I sat in the plush back seat of a town car, lulled by the sounds of the windshield wipers moving steadily like a metronome. I exited the cab and ducked into Betony, narrowly escaping the rain.
I was the first one to arrive, nearly 20 minutes early. After checking in with the hostess, I sat at the bar and took a look at my surroundings. Ornate carvings adorned the walls, motifs stretched across the vast ceiling.
***
Jack, the jovial bartender with an Australian accent, nudged me and asked if ""gin and I got along"".
I was intrigued. ""Why?"" I asked.
""Well there was a mix-up with another order and we have an extra Negroni..."" he winked.
 
***
The Negroni washed down delicious bar snacks. Thin, crispy Cabot cheddar crackers and salted bread crumbs.
 
I felt a tap on my shoulder as Sharon was the next to arrive. After ordering a delicious Palma Fizz (vodka, ginger, lime, rosewater ), we were led to our table upstairs and given the menu.
 
The menu begins with appetizers on the left, small plates in the middle and then larger entrees on the right.
 
Frank arrived and the three of us decided to order the following appetizers: foie gras bonbons, fried pickles, and chickpea panisse.
 
Michelle was the last to arrive, as a shutdown of the E train caused a 1.5 hr delay. Since we couldn't get a hold of her via phone, text, email for over an hour, we had no idea what happened to her. The atmosphere prickled with nervous anxiety, the fear of the unknown palpable. After a quick prayer, a deluge of Michelle's texts flooded our phones to our relief. To their credit, Betony's servers were patient and periodically checked up on us to make sure everything was ok.
 
With our party seated at 11pm for the 9pm resi, we hungrily devoured the foie gras bonbons which were flashed with liquid nitrogen and covered in candied cashews and crusted with black pepper. Fantastic. The fried pickles with peppers packed a little heat which cooled off with the yogurt.
 
Our server, Daniel, who used to be a sommelier at The NoMad, presented a dish, compliments of the kitchen. He knew that we were worried sick about Michelle and wanted us to enjoy our dinner. Heirloom tomato gazpacho (zebra tomatoes are green even when ripe) with frozen goat cheese sorbet showcased familiar flavors with unconventional preparation.
 
The chickpea panisse tasted like a crispy spring roll with a puree of chickpea inside. The savory ham went well with the creamy chickpea.
 
When we split the bread apart, billowing wisps of steam gave us a mini-facial. I almost dropped the bread on the floor because it burned my fingers. We immediately spread the butter on the bread and watched it melt into a small puddle. Great crust and a burst of anise-licorice essence from the caraway seeds.
 
The seared foie gras dish is a must-order. Sour collard greens, crispy kale, smooth foie with ham hock and ham consommé. Tip: With your leftover bread, sop up the last drop.
 
While we waited for our entrees, we talked about our careers. I'm always curious to hear the different work environments of my friends - to hear what works and what can be improved to increase efficiency. Frank and Sharon, both in finance, have been friends for a very long time and she still has no idea what he does for a living. (He is a product manager for mobile applications at a financial services firm). Pretty soon, the focus shifted to my job. When one asks what I do, there are many answers. Suffice it to say that I wear many hats as my firm of 50 people can be described as entrepreneurial by nature, a perfect conduit for me to take on disparate responsibilities and segue in and out of different verticals. The lack of red tape and micromanaging allows me to focus energies on the tasks at hand instead of worrying about politics and face time with senior management. As long as you get the work done, that's all that matters.
 
The plates of short ribs cut our conversation short. This dish deserves all the hype. The application of beef fat throughout the process has yielded the best short rib I have ever tasted. The fried sweetbreads provided crunch and the charred romaine helped cut through the fat.
 
I almost forgot about the second entree that I ordered, a glistening chicken roasted with chanterelles and Tokyo turnips. The perfectly crisped skin served as a protective shield for the chunk of meat as its drippings naturally mixed with the fragrant pool of chanterelles.
 
I let the hostess know ahead of time to prepare something special for Frank and Michelle to celebrate their recent engagement. Champagne foam with strawberry sorbet and pannacotta with lemon ""caviar"" (comprised of an agar and lemon reduction). The hot mixture gets plunged into a cold bath which forms small sacs that look like caviar.

"Love this place. Real Italians.. Ok, not in the kitchen, but the cooks know how to make some good pasta.  Some notes:

Matt B:  sorry dude but those ravioli are fantastic as is.  Brown butter?  BROWN BUTTER?  Why? Did you grow up with an Irish mom who couldnt cook and always burned the butter? What is tasty about semi burned butter?  How about nothing.  The flavor in that sauce is the sage. I cut each ravioli in half w a tiny piece of sage and rub it so the sauce enters inside the ravioli. It doubles the tasting pleasure.

I was disappointed once - it was a fish special. I ordered from the bartender, in Italian and he didnt explain the dish, (as a waitress would have).  It came and was smothered in semi raw red peppers (the big veg, not the hot kind). I hate raw red pepper. Makes me sick. It overpowers all the other flavors in the dish. 

On another night- i was delighted with a spaghetti with bottarga (salted, pressed fish eggs from sicily) and clams.

Mmm dam. I heard a rumor they make carbonara for lunch on weekends! They open in 27 minutes!  I am gonna walk over !!!",0.0
"Absolutely sick. This is my default choice for fresh and fan-frickin-tactic seafood. Took a friend here as a congratulatory dinner and tried it in February of 2014. I've been here eight times since. Yeah, I got problems.

The decor is very nice, makes you forget that you're in Midtown; especially the market looking area by the kitchen.

The complimentary dips and olive oil with the bread are great. For appetizers, I've tried most of them but highly recommend the Avra Octapodi and the Chilean Souvlaki. The Chilean Souvlaki is a two-inch long piece of glorious sea bass, skewered with this drizzle of red pepper sauce. They also make a fabulous truffle fries.

Arctic Char is deliciously moist and is served atop mountain greens, great if you're in the salmon mood. The Plaki is a generous piece of sea bass in a light tomato sauce with onions and potatoes. I usually don't like fish in sauce but this one gets a pass. My personal ""go to"" is the Lavraki, incredibly moist and flaky. Just olive oil, garlic, capers and some lemon. 

On one of my rebound visits we tried the imported prawns, these are shrimp out of Game of Thrones. At $49.99 per lb. (each weighs about 1/2 lb.) a plate has a hefty tag but an even heftier taste. So succulent and this beautiful char-grilled flavor.

What sucks is my garage is right next door so her sweet siren calls to me twice a day. Totally recommend for a client meal or a date. Also works if you're in the YOLO mood and just want some F'n good seafood.",0.0
"After walking around time square we were ready for some good Chinese food.  We came in and the first thing it had a great ambiance.   Then we ordered our food which in the menu did not have alot of choices for Chinese food.  I understand they have different choices but come on, only few choices for Chinese food was a first big indicator that spells trouble. 

Finally food came and the fried rice was not great.  The mongolian beef was tough and did not taste like real mongolian beef.  The only reason they have a one star is because of it's sushi.  So if you want great Chinese food,  avoid this place because it was over price for it's quality of food and the portions were small and it feels like your going to get food poisoning.",0.0
"This bar is great, always hopping and they let patrons bring their pups. It is one of my favorite bars in the area. 

Many of the staff members are nice enough, if not a little flustered at the thirsty crowds that can show up out of nowhere. I have had a couple of bad experiences with one particularly nasty bartender - I don't know if he means to be a dick or if he is just always flustered but he isn't pleasant to order from. Maybe it makes him feel better to make people feel stupid or something - maybe he is just sick of drunk hipster assholes and shares the wealth. In any case, I tend to avoid his shift which sucks because that particular time is a great time to visit this bar (I won't mention the actual shift as I don't want to call someone out so publicly and specifically). 

Anyway, it is an upscale dive-ish bar and they have a lot of beer on tap. Prices are moderate and the booths are comfortable if you can grab one.",0.0

The service was good, the chicken liver pate was ok but everything else was pretty unappetizing. Cabbage, meh, squid ink pasta I almost gagged, the other pasta, pretty little bundles with braised lamb neck.

The service is extremely professional, and the food, while not phenomenal, is good. My lamb looked like it was severely undercooked. I usually get my steaks rare, but I didn't know if eating lamb this rare was safe. I ate it anyway, and it was moist, tender, and quite tasty. That was last night and I'm not sick yet, so yay! Overall a good experience, except at the end of our meal we felt really rushed. They wanted to herd us out quickly to make room for the next guests. The waitstaff was cleaning our table before we were even able to get up and leave. While it was a nice dinner, we probably won't come back.",0.0
"My college friends and I have an annual secret santa exchange that I organize and it's always hard to find places that take large reservations (14+) without enforcing a pre fixe menu. Forcella is awesome in that respect because I was able to make a reservation for 14 on Open Table!! Sick.

I've been to a different location of Forcella so I know their pizza is bomb. We ordered bottles of wine for the table and some of the boys opted for beer. For appetizers, we ordered octopus, calamari and tuna tartar. They were all spectacular! The olives and potatoes that came with the octopus were equally as good as the octopus itself!!

The pizzas here are actually a little different than their downtown location. I had the burrata, prosciutto and arugula pizza. It was loaded with arugula which I love! The middle of the pizza was a little soggy though so it was had to pick up and eat. My guy friends found the crust to be a little lacking, but I like that doughy bread like texture.

We were a bit loud because there's 14 of us and we were drinking and opening presents. I guess the table next to us complained and management had to come over and tell us to simmer down. This was kinda lame because we were clearly having a good time and ordering a lot. They also forgot one person's order and we had to ask for it later and didn't serve any bread for the table.

Semi soggy pizza, being scolded by management and forgotten dish = minus 2 stars.",0.0

He put blame on me when I know what I said. I never asked for bacon and always make sure to mention turkey bacon. I do not eat pork because it makes me very sick after not eating it for 2 years. I  know what I said. And while I made the order he was preoccupied with another task.

"Wow a Michelin star. I never been to a Michelin star restaurant until now. Was it worth it? 

I tried their Chef's choice 10 course meal. I also got the wine pairing. They also have a tea service which was interesting. 

The theme of the Chef's Choice was umami. Every dish was supposed to make us experience the flavor of Umami. I love umami. It's one of my favorite flavors since it's so prevalent in Asian cuisine. 

They treated us like royalty, like a restaurant of this caliber should. I liked the staff. They were polite, fun, and pleasant. 

The Chef' Choice was a fun experience. The food was interactive. For example, for the dessert course, you had to forage for your food. I felt like a wood mouse looking for branches and nuts to eat.

The course were simple and delicious. I have to admit, however, I was getting sick of umami near the end. I love umami and loved the theme. But it was too much of a good thing. 

Some of the courses was a miss for me. For example, their cole slaw was just cole slaw. All they did was stack up the vegetables like Lincoln Logs. I guess I can give them points for presentation. 

The courses had all the fancy ingredients: a caviar here, a foie gras here, a oyster here, and a sweet potato there. You know, typical stuff. Although I was surprised they didn't have anything with tomato since they are packed with umami taste. Of course, if they wanted to be daring, they could've used human breast milk, which was suppose to have good amounts of umami. 

We didn't get any Amuse Bouches though. Sure, I shouldn't expect them, since they're extra, but it seemed like the table next to us got them. I'm wondering why the 10 course meal didn't get any Amuse Bouches while the 4 course table next to us got them. Maybe the Amuse Bouches would've ruined the umami theme?

I mentioned the tea service earlier, and let me write about it. They described the tea service as some mind-blowing, life-changing experience with tea. The tea was suppose enhance the course. And as you steep it more, the flavor was suppose to develop and pair with the food. Nah, it just got more diluted. All they did was refresh the hot water in the tea steeper. The tea was good though. However, I would recommend it if you don't want to pay for the wine pairing. 

I guess I left underwhelmed. I was expecting something more. But it was just a good 10 course meal. I didn't hate it. I thought it was good, and I had a great time.",0.0

"Review is only for the salads. 2.5 stars. 

If I didn't get 10% off everything at Europa, I likely wouldn't come here. I work close by, and one of the perks is discounted purchases here. So, as a twenty-something trying to save money, I'd be foolish not to buy lunch at Europa occasionally. Yet, for someone who really likes to enjoy their food (I'm sure I'm completely unique in this trait), it's almost just as foolish to continue buying salads here. The area around Penn Station isn't necessarily rife with awesome salad spots - a lot are average/mediocre - but I've ventured elsewhere enough to know that these just *barely* do it for me at this point.

There's nothing overtly bad about the salads. They've actually increased the number of toppings they offer in the past few years. But the freshness/flavor kind of fall flat. I'm a big protein gal, and the taste of the proteins here - at least the tofu and all of the chicken variations - are funky/bland/meh/forgettable. To clarify when I say funky - nothing here has made me sick and I'm rarely worried about that happening here. Ish just tastes weird.

A few notes about service:
-If I come here anytime after 2:30 (which I do realize would be a pretty late lunch), it's pretty damn difficult to find someone to actually help me at the salad bar. I usually need to make angry/anxious/expectant eye contact at a lot of people, or I just go up and ask one of the few employees if anyone will be manning the salad bar in the near future (not verbatim, thankfully I have some tact).
-On a positive note, there's one guy who works at the salad bar who knows my order basically  by heart. When I first started working in the area, I came here a lot due to price/convenience. And I'm a creature of habit, so I get nearly identical salads every time other than proteins. This guy knows my two dressing of choice, and more importantly, he knows how much I like my Brussels sprouts. Plus he's the most pleasant person who works at Europa, in my experience. So shout out to him. Otherwise, I'd say go elsewhere for your salad fix. Europa ain't cutting it.",0.0
"Rockwell's is the first FiDi deli I've been to after being trapped at the mouth of Holland Tunnel--Soho, if you please--for years.  (My company moved.)

And, I must say, this place is a dump. Everything's dirty, broken, leaning and by a trash can--they have multiple ones close to the cooking areas. You walk in and you want to immediately walk out. Shame on the owners or management for the condition of this store.

But the service is quick and actually quite nice. And the pushover in me didn't want to say this place is too dirty for me to buy anything from, so I tried it and my egg, turkey bacon and cheese sandwich wasn't half bad.

I recently stopped in to order a ""make your own"" salad ...I live on the UWS so I thought why not try this place out. There was a guy behind the counter handling raw meat patties.. touching and patting the raw meat with his hands (wearing gloves). I asked him if I could order a salad..he then grabs a big bowl and scoops iceberg lettuce WITH THE SAME GLOVES HE TOUCHED THE RAW MEAT with (gloves touching the lettuce). I was in shock. I then reminded him that he just touched raw meat and didn't change his gloves...what was even more shocking was he then grabbed new gloves but kept the contaminated salad he just scooped up. Obviously I was not about getting some disease from the raw meat and left with no salad :(. I reported them to the New York State Department of Health....hopefully no one will get sick.",0.0

"When people look for authentic food they often expect something mind-blowingly good that knocks their socks off and immediately catapults the restaurant to their list of favorites, as if authentic automatically equates with best. But I've found that what is authentically Tibetan isn't always palatable to New Yorkers. Phayul while authentically Tibetan (just listen to the Tibetan spoken by the cooks, waitstaff, and patrons) serves up food that tastes great at altitude but is kind of bland at sea level. I'll explain more: the average elevation throughout Tibet is approximately 15,000 feet. At that altitude most people unaccustomed to that altitude will have some symptoms of altitude sickness, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, etc. At 15,000 feet food that is more bland, low in salt, sugar, and other spices seems to taste best (based on the observations of myself and friends traveling through Tibet). My guess is that heavily flavored foods will dehydrate you and bring on altitude sickness more easily.

In spite of the blandness of some dishes a few others are literally bursting with flavor. Maybe the influence of Sichuan style cooking? Shak Trak is a dish of sliced beef and red and green peppers simmering in a thick brown sauce. It can be made as spicy as you want. Also, the laphing, a dish made with different hot spices and and long cubes of mung bean noodles, has a Chinese counterpart in Sichuan liangfen. The Shogo Khaysa tastes like spicy aloo, definitely a familiar dish in Indian food.",0.0

"I'd heard of this place years ago, so knew I wanted to pay a visit on my holiday to NY. 
Located in the upper east side not far from Bloomingdales, its a little off the main tourist track (which isn't a bad thing!)

Inside you'll find three floors of candies, chocolates, bars, pick n mix style sweets, an icecream station, toys, fudge - honestly its heaven!

I really wanted to sample it all, but had to weigh up what could sensibly survive a return journey back to the UK so we bought a selection of the stores signature and dessert bars to try, including unusual combos like birthday cake, malted milk, brownie bark and cookie dough bars. At nearly $4 for a bar they're not the cheapest, but the chocolate is delicious - my sister especially loved the Peanut Butter one and the caramel one was smooth and sweet without being sickly. 

I was tempted by the pick your own sweets and chocolate - things like candy cables, dummies, chocolate bark and dough, pretzels etc which can be bought by the kg with options to fill a soda can worth, a scoop jar a giant cupcake or just a bag full of goodies. Again, it works out quite expensive but the quality of the stuff is really great and would definitely make a nice gift. 

Returning home I wish I'd bought more goodies, and hope they open a branch in the UK as it really is a step up from the standard American pop up stores which seem to keep appearing on the high street.",0.0
"I came back about a month ago and the pad kee mao was sickly sweet. This was after I had asked for it to be extra spicy. But whatever they put in it (it very well could have been pure refined sugar) made it very difficult to eat. I was going out after so I just needed something in my stomach and tried to choke it down, but couldn't finish it.",0.0
"I bought spoiled raw chicken breast from here. Imagine my surprise when I open my package and got a whiff of a sour smell! Disgusting! Waste of money that I had to throw the entire package away. I purchased way before the Sell By date too. Spoiled chicken can make someone really sick!! 

Produce quality is terrible, their selection of food is cheap. I usually shop at Whole Foods at Union Square, and come here only I have no other choice.",0.0
"This is one of the most authentic places for Mexican food and tacos. Few years ago, they had a ""sauce and veggie cart"" station where you can get as much green, orange, or red hot sauce as you want, along with some radishes, vegetables, jalapenos with your tacos. They took the cart away. Now, they bring the green and orange habinero hot sauce to you. The sauce gives it away. I've been to Cancun, Mexico 5 times and this place even outshines the food over there. There are many, many taco food carts and taco spots around Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. For $2 and change per soft taco, 2 will fill you. You can purchase the sauce here for $3 quantity equivalent of a coffee cup size. When you sit in the small cafe, you feel like you're back in Mexico. I'm glad they are still around. Supposedly they may not always be A status in NYC, but when you eat out, I usually make sure I don't go to a place rated C. B means that they fell short like a point or 2 on details. Unless you make it yourself, just take what you can get because other countries I've visited, they were not always ""A"" status to my book. But you're in it for the taste, experience, and just don't get sick from eating it that's all.",0.0
"Talk RUDE service!!! I will never step foot in this place ever again!!! I'm sick of all these angry hipsters who own business or who work in the food industry!

Never will I ever set foot in this place ever again!",0.0
This place is the worst. When I walked in I told them I made reservations and gave them my name. I sat down. Then another guy comes up and says did you make reservations? Weberman right? Benito Mussolini Jr. It took 15 minutes to get one beer then the waiter told me the reason was the printer was broken.  First lie. These were dirty Italian cheats. The apps - one scummy oyster and a small piece of pork belly  $14. Then the bone marrow. What a laugh. You could hardly see it. The egg noodles I had were not made in the place but were GOODMAN's out of a box. And the Branzzino was dry and over cooked. The noise level was so high it was incredible and no one was saying anything of significance. Two well dressed intelligent looking guys walked in and could not believe it.  I unsubscribed from Groupon whose stock keeps tumbling after this one. The wine list was not the one on the internet but had much more expensive wines. I was sick from this cheap wine. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. It is a rip. Go to Osteria del Principe it is the real thing. Read my reviews. I know my stuff.,0.0
"It's as good as it gets. The amount of calories per burger or shake will make your body cry tears of grease. A combo of a shack burger and a shake can make you full quickly (because you will get sick of the sweet shake) even though the serving size seems small. 

Lines are usually really long but it's okay if you're waiting in line with a friend or people-watching (it's a park! let your eyes feast on quirky people).

I would still recommend this place because why not? It's the closest thing the East Coast will get to a good In-N-Out burger. Eat here at least so you can recommend your friends to go or not to go.",0.0

ordered the pad thai dinner special (comes with a soup & a drink) and it rocked my wold!!!

- pad thai had less noodles and more chicken & bean sprouts. this is something i absolutely loved and will definitely come back for. 

another thing i loved was the small side of  jalapeños that came with my order.

"This won't help everyone, but a note for folks with celiac/food allergies: I went here months ago and had a long, polite conversation with a not-very-helpful server about gluten-free options and was served a sauceless plate of sweet potato noodles with what turned out to be chunks of pure gluten as the protein. 

After I took a big bite and realized ""nope, this isn't tofu or tempeh"" and asked what it was, the same server I'd ordered from said ""Oh, yes, that's gluten."" When I explained that i couldn't eat gluten, they casually brought me a new plate. I got really sick, it sucked, and I'll never go back. 

Side note: I totally understand that a lot of people with celiac/food allergies/intolerance annoy servers, and I absolutely get that and try to always be clear, super-friendly, and non-entitled about the whole thing. But if you say you're bringing someone a gluten-free meal and you feed them pure gluten and then seem unconcerned, that's just lousy. If you're good with all the foods, this place is probably awesome, but if you have allergies or similar trouble, I'd avoid it.",0.0
"Let's get the view part of review out of the way -- it's sensational. Otherwise this place is a joke. 80's decor -- to see anything of the 21st century you must look out the window!! The food was awful -- the mushroom caps tasted like spaldeens -- yeah I said spaldeen -- cut in half & stuffed with something.I think one even bounced!  Clearly our event was overbooked -- we were packed in like sardines or the subway in rush hour or sardines on the subway -- yeah that crowded. The service was terrible. Maybe I've been watching too much Downton Abbey but isn't the server supposed to stand behind you & serve you from your side? My plate was handed to me from across the table. The kitchen was noisy & raucous & shouting & cursing drowned out our conversation. Many of the other tables had finished and left before we were served our entrees. The dessert was served willy-nilly & mostly to people who had left already!! It wasn't worth the wait since it tasted parve kosher which is okay at a Jewish wedding which this was not. Plates were dropping, drinks were spilling & glasses were breaking -- again not a Jewish wedding. The whole affair seemed less Downton Abbey & more Monty Python!! Not to mention that the coat check girl although swathed in a big scarf was freezing by the front door: I offered her my warm coat to wear for the duration of the evening which she declined. I'm sure she went home sick. Unfortunately for her she has to go back next weekend; luckily for me I don't.",0.0
"This review is for the bakery dept.'s custom cakes. 

I have been using stop & shop for cakes for the last six years. Never once disappointed. They are so moist and delicious. I find that traditional bakery cakes are always dry and the icing never tastes good, too sweet etc. 

S&S makes your cake the day if scheduled pick up so it's always fresh as possible. They have icing choices and I always get what us called "" bettercream"". Not buttercream. It is light and very flavorful but not too sickly sweet. They have three cake flavors . Vanilla, chocolate or marble. I've tried the vanilla and chocolate and they are both great, I really can't decide which one I like better. 

They also decorate them so beautifully. I was really surprised that I got this gorgeous cake from a supmarket bakery!   They also have an entire book of characters, occasions, designs to choose from if you like. 

The staff is very pleasant and helpful always!",0.0
"I used to come here pretty often, because it was the cheapest all you can eat sushi in the area. They also have other things on their menu like grilled meats, salads, seaweed, and desserts that are all part of the AYCE.

The parking lot in front is a sad excuse of a parking lot, but if you're one of the lucky people who get a spot, you're in luck. Street parking isn't too hard to find, too.

The wait times here can go from 30 min to an hour and a half during peak times. To avoid this, I either make reservations or come for lunch. 

You will get a paper to mark down the quantities of what you want. The appetizers/sides will always come first. My friends, family, and I always make the mistake of ordering too many appetizers because we're hungry, eating them all, possibly order more, and then have wide eyes when our humongous plate of sushi comes 20-30 minutes later. Everything is made on the spot, so yeah, even though you don't want to wait so long between your firsts and your sushi, you'll just have to deal with it or you won't have room for what you came for - SUSHI!

Their special rolls are probably the best tasting things. I was more of a sashimi person before I went vegan, but the sashimi isn't super fresh. Eventually you'll realize that the 20 pieces of whatever you marked down weren't 20 received, but more like 10. I guess this is because a lot of people waste or they don't think you can actually eat that much. At the end of the day, this place will hit that sushi craving hard with a popped pant button, but it isn't something that will wow you. I do have to say that their green tea ice cream is like CRACK and no matter how full I am, I will continue ordering it until I feel sick.

Yes, the customer service is pretty bad. You get started off with either warm tea or iced water, but it is a pain to get them to refill it sometimes. You will get attitude if you have a lot of questions or if you change too many things.

Nothing special, but good value. Plus, they have additional seating downstairs if you come with a big group.",0.0
"I can't believe I've only just now found this gem of a place near my apartment.  I was a little skeptical after seeing only 1 other party in the restaurant and the ghetto lighting figures they had hanging from the non-working chandeliers, but hey, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?

Prices are on point for chicken combos - 2 sides and a quarter of a chicken for $6.50 or a half chicken for $8.50.  Portions are large as well - I ordered a half chicken and took half of it home.  Green sauce is delicious and the homemade hot sauce adds the perfect amount of kick to your dish.  Beans are hearty and rice is well cooked.  The chicken is also well-cooked and flavorful - not too dry.

I saw the mixed seafood ceviche for $14 had to have it. Though $14 seems like a steep price since my entree was basically half the price, it was totally worth it.  Squid, shrimp, and raw fish galore - no food poisoning here.  The simple spicy lemon marinade was to-die for.

One thing I noticed that was exceptional and that I must point out was the level of customer service here.  My dirty napkins were replaced, my water was always full, and someone came around to make sure I had enough green sauce.  They constantly came around asking if we needed anything else and if we were doing okay.  It's not everyday that you'll find this level of service around the City, and especially not at a $$$$ establishment.",0.0
Food is better than other small thai places. Had lunch special $15 and Kah soy with a friend. Thai iced tea is expected. Tom yum soup  was sweeter than usual soups I tried. Spring roll and drunken noodle was yummy. Kah soy was yummy until at the end I start to not taste the yumminess (when u get sick of food because u ate same thing over for long time). Maybe because flavor is pretty strong. Dessert we wanted they ran out so we went for green tea ice cream which was pretty smaller than I expected. Cash only. Good service.

"Why do I have to give a star? Worst sushi place I've ever had. I've tried sushi restaurants in Manhattan, Brooklyn, long Island and even Staten island, here is the worst one in Queens.

Fishy, warm,smell sashimi, no flavor sushi rice, cheap raw fish but pricey. We ordered sushi n sashimi combo and a California roll for take out. There were only 6 pieces sushi(egg, fake crab meat,shrimp and tuna) and few pieces sashimi(super dark meat tuna,cheapest one) I can't believe they even don't have salmon . And we ordered the super basic California roll, you know what, they make it only with fake crab meat and avocado, no cucumber.We threw away all the sashimi, wanna throw up too, waste money right? but I don't want to get sick We definitely will not try this place again.",0.0
"Uhhhh, HELL YEAH.

When I again fell prey to the combination of my empty fridge and insane hunger, I ordered from here because I figured that raw food would be that much faster.

Though the delivery time said 30-45 minutes, the delivery man was here in under 20 minutes!  Also, he was not rude-- so perhaps I got a different guy.  In fact, he was all smiles!  Score!

Kind of nervous that I must have a container of mercury poisoning and a mishmash of rice, I opened the bag to see that there were three very neat and tidy rolls of very normal size.  I ordered the white tuna roll, the salmon mango roll, and a spicy yellowtail hand roll.  All were just $3.10 each.    

I would highly recommend the spicy yellowtail hand roll.  It was huge and filling, and very flavorful.  My second favorite was the salmon mango roll, which was quite good and had toasted sesame seeds surrounding it.  

The white tuna was just OK.  It wasn't the best white tuna in the world, but it certainly wasn't bad.

I also got the seaweed salad, which was very fresh and just delightful!

The ginger was just OK, and next time I will ask for extra wasabi.  I could not believe my eyes at the price, though.  I was afraid to order $1.00 sushi à la cart, but next time I'll load up on it.  

Nothing smelled fishy and it all tasted good.  I will certainly order sushi delivery from them again.  If I have lots of friends over, we may even opt for a party platter or something.  I was just so impressed.  This was a Seamless win.",0.0
"Long and detailed reviews are great, but nobody reads them, and I want everyone to read this.  This is not the same Indian place you've ordered from 100 times, even though its been 30 different places that have opened, closed, etc.. etc..

If you want bland Chicken Tikka Masala, go to one of those standard places.  But if you actually like the cuisine of Indian food, and are sick of the standard bland and oily dishes that are geared towards American tastes, then try this place.  This is what you will get if you eat at an Indian home.  Delicious and fresh tasting dishes that really do it justice.  About the only thing that differed from my meals (albeit vegetarian) at Sanskriti and my meals in India is the amount of spice.  Sanskriti understandably tones it down as to not shock their customers.  But otherwise this is the type of Indian food that turns the cuisine from a niche pig out meal to something you could conceivably eat every day and feel great, healthy, and not get bored by.  I absolutely love this place and I hope that it stays open for a long long time.  I intend to order more frequently from here just to do my part in trying to make that happen, and I urge you to do the same.",0.0
"Don't eat here. I'm really sick of walking in without reservations and having to wait because people have found out about this PERFECT little restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. 

The burger is enormous and juicy and is served with duck fat fried chips. You can almost make two meals out of it, but you won't. The beef stew with white beans is a tad thick, but is filled with rosemary and thyme and is a perfect self-contained fall meal. The roasted chicken is herby and juicy. The bread! The onion soup! The Parmesan fries! Get it all, because you really can't go wrong, and it's so good that you'll forget all about your diet.

Now for a few tiny critiques: They serve hot tea but not iced tea and have a very limited drink selection for those of us who don't want booze. Woman can not live on tap water alone. 
And, the kale salad was so overly dressed with a think helping of ""garlic aioli"" dressing that it was inedible.

"Me and my boy Bob wanted to have a guys night out so we decided to run for the border. Hey, love the look and feel of the place, seems like it's been recently redone. If you go at the right time you can see a lot of Jets and Giants jerseys on the customers  so it makes me feel at home.

I've been eating at Taco Bell my entire life, my mom used to eat at one in Long Island while she was pregnant with me and knew the lady who worked behind the counter. The same woman worked there throughout my childhood and watched over me through highschool.  She still works at the same one til this day. As I graduated and moved away to Brooklyn (I got a nice computer design job) I sometimes need to stop in to a t-bell every once in a while to make me feel less home sick. 

This visit however made me hate home. I felt like my mom didn't come home tonight.

I ordered a T5 with a bonus cheesy gordita crunch, all vegetarian. And what I got was not up to par! The nachos only had nacho cheese and beans. Where's the sour cream and tomatoes!! Come on! And then my beautifully delicious CGC didn't even have beans in it! That is just not right. My taco supreme was correct but that was the weakest link to my classic order.

Needless to say Shawana, my server, was very kind, but she needs to get her staff into place! I love the bell and need to go back but I'm scared.",0.0
"One of the worst chinese experiences ever.  Chin Chin is old, dusted and depressing. The worst is the delivery guys coming down from their motorbikes and walking through the main hall all night long. 
   The food wasn't that bad. The shrimps Szechuan were salty but ok, the citrus sautéed meat nothing special. The $78 pinot noir was light, it was better to ask a bottle for two than the expensive wine glasses.

"Are You Sick of Bad Pizza Yet?
Introducing a New Restaurant - the Only One Serving this Cuisine in Brooklyn
Don't Wait - It Won't Remain Secret for Long

Dear Reader:
Let's face it, the restaurants in Carroll Gardens have become a bit...hmm, how should I put this... stale? 
It seems like there is one, big, central kitchen making food for all the restaurants, and the only way to tell them apart is from the signs out front. 
Sure, we could make the walk over to the bedbug-infested subway, crowd in with everybody and head into Manhattan, searching -- possibly in vain -- for a pleasant, inexpensive, and hassle-free meal. 
Of course, if we do find this magical place, once we finish eating, we will have to turn around and make the late-night return trip home...If the trains are running!
I'd like to suggest an option that may seem like more of a vacation than a nuissance.
Have you heard of La Cigogne, the new Alsatian restaurant -- the only restaurant of its kind in Brooklyn -- that just opened... 
In our neighborhood!
I'm telling you, my girlfriend and I were strolling by La Cigogne last week and the atmosphere inside was calling to us...and we had just eaten.
In fact, when we walked by on a Sunday during this year's World Cup, the restaurant was full and they had not even been awarded their liquor license yet. Can you believe it? When is the last time that you saw soccer fans watching a match without alcohol? 

Alot of the exitement about La Cigogne has to do with the owners, Jeremy and Damien. They've brought everything that they love from Alsace and combined it with everything that they love about America. 
They treat you like you are a close friend and not -- like some restaurants in our neighborhood that will go unnamed -- like they are doing you a favor.
And while La Cigogne's atmosphere transports you from the hustle and bustle of New York to the laid back, seize-the-day vibe of the French-Swiss-German border, it is the food that makes you want to come back again and again. Gone are the generic pastas, salads, and cookie-cutter pizzas. 
La Gigogne offers a unique blend of Alsatian fair. 
What does that mean? 
Well, it means that you are getting the best blend of three distinct, yet complementary, culinary traditions that makes Alsatian cuisine renowned all over the world.
Nestled on France's eastern border with Switzerald and Germany, Alsace is famous for being one of the most highly concentrated Michelin Star regions in the world.
This means that you can get a Mac n' Cheese appetizer made with rich, smooth, melted, delicious cheese -- not made with ingredients that sound like they are straight from a laboratory. 
You can get a burger that reminds you that hamburgers can be delicacies, not limp, soggy-breaded, overcooked cast-offs.
Looking to venture deep into Alsatian territory? 
La Cigogne's spätzles will make you wonder why you have waited this long for food this good. My personal favorite is the Steak Frite entree, which is so authentic that it should come with a beret -- although, I'm sure that you could get it with a baguette if you asked nicely.
To complete the illusion of vacation bliss, you can enjoy a wide array of Alsatian wines and beers...beers that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the city...beers so tasty that you'll wonder why they've been hidden from you for all this time.
Listen, typing this review has made my mouth begin to salivate. So, head on out to La Cigogne. You'll thank me later. 
À votre sante!

"Bone-in Burger. Foie Gras Gnocchi. That should give you an idea that you are in for a different kind of steakhouse experience.

The latest M. Wells joint is just as bizarre and amazing as their previous ones, and this place is a definite must try.

Don't let the run-down exterior and the shady L.I.C. neighborhood fool you - once you step inside, behold a really beautiful and very nice dining room, with an open kitchen and raw bar and some really funky decor. We were seated next to what looked like it could have been a shelf in my mother's house, with some weird knick-knacks and glassware on display.

The service here is perfect, and just what you would expect from a nice steakhouse. From the moment you are seated, you are treated right. We were greeted promptly with some delicious warm Pretzel Rolls served in a little sack. This was some excellent complimentary bread - super soft and pillowy and enough to make you ask for some more.

One of the really fun parts of the meal here is the presentation of the food. Everything looks really nice in addition to tasting great. We ordered a ton of food, which was mostly amazing:

- M. Wells Caesar ($12)
This is an impressive-looking plate of salad, with a ton of cheese covering the deliciously crunchy croutons and lettuce. It's fairly standard-tasting caesar salad, which is not a bad thing, and is a nice, lighter refreshing way to start the meal.

- Onion & Bone Marrow Soup ($14)
This is a great take on French Onion Soup, with a giant bone filled with marrow stuck in the middle of the bowl. Here's where it starts getting overwhelming, but this was really delicious too.

- Bone-in Burger ($15)
This seems to be the thing everyone is talking about, and the thing to get here. It is as bizarre as it sounds - a burger with a giant bone sticking out of it. It's a mess to eat, even once you manage to get the bone out of it. It's kind of like a steak on a bun, since the meat is made of a mix of different high quality and delicious meats. This burger really is incredible and is worth all of the hype you are hearing about or will soon hear about it. It's not just a novelty and something you get just to Instagram a picture of, it really is excellent. 

- Grass-fed Cowboy Steak ($50)
This is a really delicious steak, but that price tag hurts a bit. It was super buttery and flavorful, but had quite a bit of fat and not quite enough meat for me.

- Dill Carrots ($10)
This was the one thing I didn't really particularly like. $10 for a bunch of carrots swimming in oil. Not that great. I should have just gone with instinct and got more carbs instead of trying to add some silly vegetables to the mix.

- Poutine ($10)
I also don't really get poutine yet. I've tried it a number of times, and I always wonder why I do it, when after I enjoy a few crispy, not completely soggy and saturated fries, I pretty much get sick of it. Some of the cheese curds were also completely raw, which I don't know if it was the intention, but I didn't quite enjoy. Maybe go with the regular fries next time.

- Cinnamon Cake ($11) a la mode (+ $3)
Dessert is pretty great here. The pastry chef comes around with a dessert cart after you make your selection from a large number of cakes and other options. I kept seeing stuff about this cake, so I figured I should try it, and it did not disappoint. It's not very rich, which is what most people like about it, but I kind of wish I tried the richer sounding Black Forest Cake, since I enjoy sweetness to the point of diabetes. This was really great though, and is a nice choice to end the meal after the overwhelming meat sweats start to set in.

This place is out there, both in concept and location, but I am a fan. It is pricey like you would also expect from a nice steakhouse, but the very unique and different options make it a must try. I would love to return once they introduce some new menu items and to try some more of the delicious cakes.",0.0
"I don't write reviews very often but this place deserves better rating. 

Just few nights ago, I was starving to death, ready to eat anything anyone puts in my mouth when I ordered a NYPD Panini from Woodside Pizzeria around 10:30PM. Once I arrived home, I took a shower and opened the bag to find out that they indeed gave me an order of Ravioli, which tasted REAL. Usually I would have gone back and asked for the item I ordered, but I was already clean and ready to be isolated from the outer world so I just fed myself up with what I had. 

Tonight, just few minutes ago, I placed another order of a NYPD Panini and the gentleman, who seems to be the owner of the restaurant, asked if he handed me the wrong order last time. I was surprised that he remembered and even more surprised that he brought it up. So I said yes and he took my order. Once I arrived the restaurant to pick up my order, not only I received what I ordered this time but I got them for FREE. The order of Ravioli was priced higher than the order I placed, I noticed, and I almost begged him to let me pay for the Ravioli I accidentally received but no, he refused all my offers and told me to enjoy the panini. Not only the food itself was excellent (I have a very sensitive stomach and often it results in the sickness tomorrow morning--NEVER happened here), I was able to experience a ""great customer service"", which I can't remember the last time I was given. 

I definitely recommend this place for everyone who lives around and will go back again and again for sure.",0.0

"The last time I went to Bareburger was in july of last year! I decided to give this place a second shot, merely bc I was craving a burger and as a Celiac I don't have many other options out there. I had a very attentive and caring waitress. I explained to  her what happened the previous time I ate here and she went out of her way to make sure the cooks changed their gloves and that my meal was 100% gluten free with zero traces of contamination. She was so sweet! and the food was delicious! BUT  BEST OF ALL, I did not get sick!! Restaurants need to be THIS gluten friendly! 

If you have any gluten allergies, make sure to specify the importance of it to the friendly staff and they will go out of their way for you! They want you to not get sick and be able to enjoy their meals! 

The waitress mentioned to me that I might have had a temporary waitress last summer and therefore wasn't too sure what was GF or not, and may have given me regular bread instead, making me sick! 

Lastly, THE FRENCH FRIES ARE GLUTEN FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!! (jumping up in joy!)",0.0
"Hong Kong Station is one of the most modern Cantonese restaurants in the entire city, insomuch that it draws on trends in dining in the Pearl River Delta that are happening right now.

The signs are obvious. The décor isn't dragon pastiche or barely-decorated hovel, this is a tribute to Hong Kong's greatest achievement of the late-colonial era - the subway station. The colorful MTR signage and inexpensive white tables represent the keen eye for aesthetics on an Ikea budget that dominates the strips of restaurants on Hong Kong island's south shore. 

The food is also modern, an attempt to bring the Hong Kong noodle soup into the salad bar age. Pick out a number of toppings, noodles and mix-ins, and then are quickly cooked in hot water. The ingredients look pretty sickly placed out on a countertop, which dried out pieces of meat and shriveled bits of tofu. There's nothing particularly dirty, but there's a layer of use that's not present in the dining room era. Perhaps it's best just to order based on pictures. 

Once prepared, however, the result is solid. The chili oil and egg noodles, with added fish balls, would be below average in Hong Kong but here makes the grade. Bonus points for the availability of some stranger ingredients, like organ meat and a variety of seafood balls.",0.0
"I don't know what it is, but I wasn't as wow'ed as everyone else was/is! Maybe I'm just a true Organic Avenue lover, but Liquiteria is just not my cup of juice. 

Granted, they have a wide variety of juices and other things like food, snacks, packaged goods, and even fresh, made on the spot, cold-pressed juices and smoothies; versus OA which only offers bottled beverages and food. 

This place is very vibrantly colored and decorated. Definitely the most lively colored juice bar! 

As for the juice itself, it's delicious, and large. I was surprised that a sickly shade of brown that I was drinking was surprisingly sweet (and yummy for that matter). It definitely will fill you up quite nicely. 

One thing that does irk me is that their bottled beverages don't have nutritious facts. C'mon at least include the ingredients.",0.0
"Love this little place! It reminds me of bakeries I've been to in Europe.  My 2 favorites are the blueberry clafoutis (fresh blueberries!!) & the raspberry linzer cookie. I love that the linzer is not typical of other bakeries, cinnamon dough & the jam is not sickeningly sweet. The eclairs & the flour less chocolate cake are also a delight. Eclairs have fresh whipped cream in them (my grandparents loved them! They're very picky). I'm a diehard chocoholic and some bakeries can kill their goods with too much chocolate. The flour less chocolate cake is not like that, it has the perfect amount.  Their coffee is great if you like the strong stuff.",0.0
"This is my favourite cupcake place in NYC. I find Magnolia sickly sweet, at Little Cupcakes they aren't too sweet and are moist as well. The staff are really friendly. The cafe itself is really cute and has a lot of seating which is hard to find in a dessert venue. They serve Harney and Sons tea which I appreciate .",0.0
"A great coffee shop with excellent pastries. I recommend the Russian coffee - a shot of espresso in a cup of hot chocolate, with whipped cream. Sounds sickeningly sweet, but is really pleasantly bitter. The hot chocolate is bitter, with barely any sugar if at all. I love it, but it might not be the best for young kids. Any poppy seed pastries are completely delicious.

I took off a star for two reasons - one, it's cash only, and there's no ATM there, so if you only have a card you're out of luck. Two, the baklava is soggy, without any crunch at all. Stick with the poppy seed strudel is my suggestion.",0.0

I had the ooey gooey cake ice cream (I sampled it and as soon as it entered my mouth, I knew I had to have it) on a cookie cone. I will be coming back all throughout winter for this treat.

"After seeing endless photos of Ralph's perfectly scooped Italian Ices, I knew I had to try this place.

I ordered the Cookie Dough creme ice at the very reasonable price of $3 for a small. I was expecting it to be more like ice cream, but the texture was icy, creamy and sugary all at the same time. I took off a star because it was a little TOO sickeningly sweet for my tastes, but it could just be the flavor itself. I found it very similar to Taiwanese shaved ice since the flavors were blended in.

"Rarely when I have deli food is my favourite part the soup. 

Aside from the soup actually being one of the best matzah ball experiences of my life (sorry mom) the real issue here is a combination of this place A) Not being Montreal smoked meat and B) Not being Katz's which is the only substitute for Montreal smoked meat. 

Home sickness aside, I guess I am just not a pastrami/corn beef guy. Granted I head the lean cut and not the full fat, but I still am not impressed. It's just too dry.

"First off I know Sushi - I'm Asian.  Period.
This is some good sushi - not just for freshness (it has to be fresh otherwise you'll get diarrhea) but more for creativity

Appetizers are ALL good, I'm biased towards the agadashi tofu (my favorite - yum yum yum)

For sushi, I always get the Tuna special dish - $55.  You get a spicy tuna roll and 10 pieces of specially prepared, different taste profile tuna sushi.  This dish is friggin awesome!!!  My only gripe with this dish is one time the waiter was pointing to each piece explaining what it was and his finger was really close to touching each piece - made me a little nervous 

If you want the best sushi experience, go to Sushi of Gari 46 (I know there are other ones but I heard each are a little different and this one i already know is the bomb)

First time was a few months ago to buy Sudafed when I had was sick, unfortunately on a day I had to go to work, with horrible sinus congestion and DayQuil and mucinex was not working.  
This was how that visit went down:

Me (clearly nasally sniffling and gruff, with tissues and chicken noodle soup in my hand): Good afternoon, can I please get 1 pack of Sudafed?

Pharmacist: uhh....that's in aisle 13...

Me: sorry, not the phenylephrine...I tried but it hasn't been working.

Him: ohh...yeah...regular sudafed...yeah we have that back here...

Me: yes I know, thanks...

Him: okay---*doesnt move, just looks me up and down and stares at me* --but we don't have it back here....

My first though was: Either this CVS sucks or I just got judged hardcore.


Anyway, I JUST got 2 wisdom teeth extracted and I went to fill my prescription for Percocet. The lady did the same thing, looked me up and down, whispered a few things off to the side with her coworker, and told me ""we don't have this"".

I still can't differentiate weather they are judging me based of my appearance, or if they are genuinely the worst pharmacy in Flatbush.",0.0
"This place was so-so in my book.

Came here on a Tuesday for a friend's going away get together and found the place to be backed with fairly older crowd. Come to find out, there are two groups meeting (Nest Seekers and Citi Habitats), so we got a table in the back, where it was dead.

The server seemed super busy, although, there weren't many tables filled. Luckily, we all had a lot to talk about, so we didn't really mind. 

When our food came, everyone agreed it was 'eh' - however, my friends who ordered the salads, enjoyed them. I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was definitely not my favorite. We had the Spinach Artichoke Bacon dip as an appetizer, which was super salty. Even the sweet potato fries were not great.

I gave them two stars for the selection of beer. On an October evening, I was super pleased to find that they had a vast selection of pumpkin beers (my fav)!

Want to know the WORST part? As we were paying our bill, our friend noticed a HUGE cockroach on the wall by the bathrooms. Immediately, we all became sick to our stomachs and wanted to get the hell out. Even with an ""A"" rating, we did not feel comfortable here any longer.

I probably wouldn't come back to this place, unless I was going for the booze - and I would stay away from the bathroom.",0.0
"Came here for happy hour with a friend. We felt super rushed at first as the bartender stopped us in mid conversation to ask if we wanted guacamole twice I believe. We didn't.

One ($7 at happy hour) frozen margarita got me quite tipsy and I'm so not a light weight... at all! However, the happy hour red wine sangria made me sick because it was the most overly sweet sangria I've ever had in my life. I definitely do not recommend it. I was going to get a glass of white wine but didn't because they only carry Chardonnay (ummm gross). The food came out super quick and was tasty and, according to my friend who knows much better than I do, it was pretty authentic. I'd definitely give it a shot again if in the area. Just avoid that sangria and you will be fine!",0.0
"Lazy kitchen. Let me start by saying I always need to special order food because I have celiac disease. I have yet to find a restaurant in NY that cannot accommodate me in some way, shape or form. Until today. I stopped into Coffee Shop for breakfast this morning and immediately alerted my server to my condition and asked a few questions; is there flour in the home fries? (sometimes there is), are they cooked in the same oil as items with flour? She said they were and I knew I couldn't order them. I eventually asked to order eggs cooked in a pan rather than on the grill because cross-contamination makes me sick. A minute after I ordered someone other than my server came to the table to tell me they couldn't cook the eggs in a pan because it was too much work. I was asked what else I would like to have instead and I said nothing. After my awkward business meeting ended because he ate and I didn't I stopped to talk to the manager who had no idea the kitchen refused to make my food. He said he would talk to them so it wouldn't happen again. I told him it was too late for me. I am never going back.

How lazy can a kitchen be that cooking eggs in a pan creates that much extra work?",0.0
"I recently came to Bann with my girlfriend after purchasing a Groupon which cost $20 for $40 of Korean BBQ.

VENUE:

Classy joint.  When you first walk in there's a bar and some tables and it curls around to a larger seating area.  It's definitely upscale.

THE SERVICE:

Prompt, knowledgeable, friendly, attentive.

THE FOOD:

To start off, the ""barbecues"" are subtle mini grills embedded within the tables themselves.  One can certainly go to this restaurant and NOT order BBQ which it seemed a lot of people did.  However, we definitely wanted that experience.

As mentioned, the grill is subtetly embedded within the table and the waiter simply opens the top up, flicks a knob and suddenly you have a modest, but effective grill at your finger tips.

We were nervous about getting chicken or beef because we though we would probably be crappy chefs and cook it poorly.  So, we got the yellow fin tuna as it is not only a favorite of ours, but there's a range of ways it can be served from rare to well done and you don't have to worry about getting sick.

Any BBQ choice is served with their signature marinade as well as rice, house salad, kimchi, pickled vegetables & fresh lettuce wraps.

I thought the tuna was excellent and I really enjoyed the part of cooking it myself.  One positive aspect of cooking the tuna myself was the moment it was done I could pop it off the grill, throw it in a lettuce wrap, top it with some pickled veggies and kimchi (a sort of sweet and sour fermented vegetable) and boom, I've got a piping hot, fresh and delicious meal.

We also ordered the:

KALBI JIM which is tender beef short rib (off the bone) with kabocha braised in a sake ginger soy glaze.  This was good, but the highlight to me was the BBQ and if I were to go back, I'd stick to the BBQ.

TIPS:

-This place is extremely expensive.  The groupon seems like a good deal and I suppose it is, but you can certainly expect to walk out of there having paid a lot; especially if you order drinks.  At that point, the groupon basically becomes useless.

-My girlfriend and I were splitting so we got the korean BBQ and the braised short rib.  However, they brought them out at the same time which kind of threw off the experience.  So, if you're on a date or just want things in a sort of sequential order (which seemed obvious, but I guess it wasn't) make sure you let your waiter know.

Here is the groupon:

"Thank you Lenny's, you have made this pregnant girl very happy. So glad to know that you have fresh roasted turkey from the oven-not deli meat! I haven't had a turkey sandwich in 7 months and this hit the spot! 

I ordered the turkey roast, provolone on a kaiser. So delish and the bread was soft.  
I have had their tuna sandwiches which are yummy, as well as their soups. I heard they do a thanksgiving turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and it's popular. They pack a large crowd in for lunch. I always say -avoid the empty restaurants! 

They also deliver. 

My only gripe:
****Attn Lenny's employees: 
you need to know whether your cheeses are pasteurized or not. That is a very common question for anyone who is pregnant. I called and asked and no one seemed to know. If a pregnant person eats cheese that is unpasteurized, they can get very very sick. Just FYI on food health and safety.",0.0
"My favorite NYC restaurant. Had my birthday dinner with friends here years ago and I still think about the tomato soup everytime I get sick. Great place for a solo lunch, mid-week dinner date, or dinner with friends. They have seating for larger groups which is soooo great for visiting friends or occasions. Not too expensive and great affordable wine list! The barbera was my favorite.

"After hearing about all the hype that surrounded this place, I had been dying to sample some of The Snail's baked goods and was so incredibly excited when I spotted the truck during a walk near Central Park. However, two donuts and a brownie later, I was left extremely disappointed. We paid $7 and waited in line for 15 minutes for the coconut Thai basil donut, speculoos glazed donut (both of which were super small), and a peanut butter cheesecake brownie. The donuts were a little soggy, and neither tasted like their names suggested. The brownie was really big, but also extremely greasy. The best part of the brownie was definitely the peanuts, which provided a nice saltiness to the chocolate's sweetness. However, the cheesecake portion of the brownie was way too rich for me, so rich that sometimes it felt like I was eating a raw brownie. This definitely put me off and I couldn't finish half the brownie without feeling sick.

Basically, the baked goods are pretty much on par with those you would get at a Starbucks or local deli place, but with the extra cost and long wait. From what it looks like, perhaps the savory options are the better bet here and if I ever spot the truck again I will only be ordering from their lunch menu.",0.0

Went for lunch and was totally disgusted by a waiter. Apparently he was sick with a cold and was hacking all around the restaurant. Heard and seen him coughing up phlegm into the bar sink and then on top of that blew his nose into the sick. Then he proceeded to go into the back in the kitchen coughing without covering his mouth. Short while later he came back handling our drinks. How do you come to work sick while working at a restaurant? There was no manager to speak to. Had to speak to another waitress. I will never go back there and I will inform all of my colleagues and friends not to enter this establishment.,0.0
"I was SOO HAPPY to stop by this place! I went to brunch beforehand and it so happened that SkyIce Sweet and Savory was only 5 blocks away. They have such unique flavors and I would come back in a heartbeat, despite it's a minimal half hour drive from Queens. 

We ordered the SkyIce Sampler, which was 5 medium scoops of ice cream. Our selections were: Thai Ice Tea (MY FAVORITE), Black Sesame with Seaweed (very extraordinary flavor), White Miso Sliced Almond (It has a very subtle taste to it and you taste more of the almond), Caramel Sea Salt (A little too sweet for me) and Banana Nutella. I also got to try their Honey Ginger (It's a strong ginger flavor with a dash of honey) I would love to drown myself in it if I was sick. 

Service is amazing. We had a candle and they lit it up and placed it over the ice cream to celebrate my friend's birthday. I also wanted to buy a Thai Ice Tea pint home but was afraid it would melt during the drive. They were able to accommodate and got me a frozen one downstairs and they wrapped ice around the container with a plastic bag and then put it in a paper bag for me to go.

"Decent sushi, decent prices, neighborhood go-to.

I met up with a college friend for dinner to catch up and we usually grab sushi. I wanted to try out a new place close to my office and Ginza 251 popped up. While walking over (in the rain I might add), I realized it wasn't the most convenient restaurant, but I was happy to finally take shelter.

With seating for about 10, this is definitely a takeout location and Seamless bags were flying left and right. We placed our sushi orders and our soups immediately came out. I ordered the chirashi, my go-to when I can't decide what kind of fish I want. The presentation and selection was great; for the first time, I had some cooked fish in my bowl. The fish were scaled properly but a few pieces still had shards of skin left, which, if anything, just made it a little less appealing. The fish quality wasn't anything to rave about, but for a Tuesday night, I felt comfortable eating it without the fear of getting sick.

Service was what we'd expect from a tiny sushi place and our water glasses never ran empty. I wouldn't necessarily come back because there wasn't anything that ""wowed"" me, but I at least know of a solid sushi joint if I'm ever in the area again.",0.0
"I love umami and I love umami burger, since my first trip there this summer in LA.

I showed up to this umami burger on a cold, rainy night. I was delighted to get the Chinese five-spice duck burger. I know what you are thinking: that sounds kinda gross, especially after my trip to China, featuring uncontrollable projectile vomiting and a now lifelong negative association with the smell of Chinese five-spice.

But it worked. In fact, it was brilliant. It was everything I ever wanted in a burger, and more.

Also, it didn't taste like duck (not that there's anything wrong with that, one way or the other). It was ground up, and likely mixed with mammal meat -- like beef or pork. They seem to like mixing meats. They've made me realize that, to me, a good burger is one where the animal providing the meat is not necessarily recognizable.",0.0
"Do not eat here. The food was inedible. 

THE SIDES - No one in my party could eat more than one bite of the creamed spinach, the potatoes gratin were flaccid, insipid and probably cooked hours before, and the Brussels sprouts wizend and stale. I would not be surprised if all of these items were reheated, prepackage food service products. 

THE STEAK was old, not aged, and presented in a pool of foul tasting fat. We choked it down because we were hungry, but it was no pleasure.The salt shaker flew around the table in a vain attempt to bring out some palatable flavor. The sickly sweet sauces were most definitely from a bottle. No professional chef worth his toque would have sent them out accompanying a $50 steak. 

DESSERT - we foolishly pre-ordered the chocolate souffle, extending our dismal stay. It was pallid and floury, certainly not worth the long wait we endured despite having ordered in advance. 

THE DECOR is oligarch Russo-tacky faux elegance. It would have been amusingly  tolerable for its camp qualities if the food was amazing, but it was not, very not.

Fragrant Spicy Chicken: lemon grass kaffir lime, galangal, flower, onion, served in homemade chef's special blended red sauce - tasty and a bit sickening like General Tso's chicken, but tastier. Something about fried chicken in a marinade makes my stomach not happy, especially a whole order. I would prefer this to General Tso's. No rice was served with the dish.

Roti Canai - on point! little oily, but tasty.

Rojak: assorted fruits and vegetables salad tossed with homemade shrimp paste topped w/ grated peanut & crispy shrimp crackers.
My friend saw this at another table and asked the folks about it, they said it was sweet and tasty. I took one bite and I was hooked on being sick, yeah it wasn't for me. The sauce is thick and black, and my friend ate it all by himself... He said he wouldn't get it again. If you want to get it share it!

"whelmed
------------
      I

I was underwhelmed.   Maybe it's because they are new but everything was just a notch below mediocre in my book.   First off, let me say that the place is gorgeous!  I love the design...all the books and gears and vaguely steampunky things are very cool.  It has a nice layout and I like having the sinks outside the bathroom.   Whoever designed it did a phenomenal job!

Also, service was friendly and somewhat efficient.  It wasn't crowded on the Wednesday night we went so I was happy with our server.

The first thing that put me off is that I ordered the Schofferhofer Grapefruit and it said $8.  Okay, that's a little high, esp with no happy hour, but I know at least three places I can go in Manhattan and get 16 ounces of for $8 so I was willing to pony up for a refreshing beer on a hot day.  However, when I got the beer, it was in a .3 liter glass.  It was filled up over the .3l line so maybe, if I'm being generous, there were almost 12 oz in the glass.    They should really print the size of the pours on the menu so you can tell beforehand if you're getting ripped off and I felt that way in this case.  The Bronx Pale Ale I got for $7 was a pint, so that was fine.  The beer menu is okay but nothing out of the ordinary.

We ordered some food.  Started with the deviled eggs.  The menu described them as if they might have a little kick to them, but they were just bland and a bit soggy.  Not awful, just immediately forgettable.   Then we ordered meals...a burger (medium), fish and chips and mac & cheese.   My friend who had the fish and chips didn't even finish them.  They were overly greasy and made him feel sick as he ate them.  My burger came out well done and thus was very dry.  There was no distinctive flavor that would make me say ""oh, this is a good burger"".  It tasted like something my sister would make.  The tomato on the burger was very good and I did like the fries.   My other friend's mac & cheese was good, so that was the highlight of the meal.

I was torn between a 3 and a 2 rating but I couldn't justify saying it was A-OK because it really wasn't.  They need to step up the game if they want to be competitive in this neighborhood.  I walked by Flatiron Hall and Ainsworth on my way there and they were packed.  This place was half empty.

After 2 cask beers and a burger. The 65$$ was definitely worth the price and a great value.

"My girlfriend and I had walked past this small restaurant at least dozens of times, but never stopped in until the other night.  Since we live in the area, we'll be regulars of this gem.

The maitre d', Sharon (?), informed us upon arrival that we were 'in luck' because there was one unreserved table for us.  She was as engaging as she was informative about the chef's cooking style (a brick oven is utilized for all cooking), the menu (fresh, innovative and intriguing), and the selections that they were 'out of'.  The renowned meatloaf was unavailable when we sat down at about 9:15 when the place was jammed for what looked to be the second turn of the evening.

My girl and I ordered a recommended side dish (bacon wrapped cabbage wedge) as a shared appetizer.  It was orgasmic.  I also had a refreshing and delicious bowl of gazpacho. The lovely lady had goat cheese stuffed chicken breast while I ordered a maple pork special.  The chicken was fantastic and the waiter (Sean) noticed I ate all of the spinach that the pork medallions were bedded on but was not eating the pork.  He asked me if the dish was satisfactory and when I told him that the pork was not tender and tough to cut and chew, he immediately offered another dish to replace it.  He was totally up front about the dish being somewhat experimental, would replace it (with a delectable short rib), and promised that dessert was on the house.  Sharon backed Sean up and the two made sure that I would be happy with my meal at The Marshal.

A slight digression:  Because servers in America are typically working as servers while pursuing other careers, it is too often that one suffers with indifferent servers who lack back of the house knowledge.  Sean and Sharon absolutely defied that notion and provided a truly superior dining experience-- and this was the case before Sean took the pork dish back for the short rib.  If I were to run a restaurant (and, in actuality, I'm currently transitioning from a white collar career to do so), Sean and Sharon represent the paragon of how the front of the house should be run.  Lookout Marshal owners!  I'd love to hire the two of them away!

Back to the dining experience.  The Marshal atmosphere is casual but the execution and presentation of the food served to us and surrounding tables that I saw connotes fresh dishes, well executed and presented, in an absurdly cordial atmosphere, and, perhaps most worthy of note, outstanding flavors and textures!

For dessert, we shared a hot fudge sundae.  Nope, exactly NOT what you're fantasizing about now.  No sickeningly sweet sauces and creams loaded with artificial crap.  Perfectly sweet, homemade ice cream (that Sean looked up on his i-Phone when I inquired about it's pedigree), just enough fudge to tantalize without causing nausea, real whipped cream and real drunken, black cherries instead of radioactive red 'maraschino' cherries.

Both of us were recovering from Pride-ful weekend, so we drank lots of water.  If I recall, The Marshal offers some whiskeys and craft beers, but no wine (not sure of that though).

"For a brief window this place was amazing. I've lived in the neighborhood for years and was ecstatic to find another -- and they are in very short supply -- local place that offers good food, good drinks, and ambiance that isn't insanely loud, full of wall to wall flat screens, and overrun by rowdy bros. It was pleasant,  nice music, a great place to take a date or read at the bar with a cocktail. It had an unpretentious class. 

 Sadly,  it seems that time has already, in just a few weeks,  come to an end. The place is always packed, which in and of itself isn't bad.

You can no longer hear yourself think, let alone have a conversation with a date or a friend. Unless of course you want to yell over dudes in polo shirts and cargo shorts hollering ""YEAH BRO!""

I am hoping that element will get sick of it and move back to their sports bars and faux Irish pubs. Maybe the owners are making money hand over fist now and so don't mind this hostile take over of, what I can only assume,  was their intent in creating such a great space. If they wanted to I wonder if there are any ways they could disincentive those people from taking over the space so aggressively.",0.0
"I'll never forget learning about the time Genghis Khan chopped down a cheery tree, and then blamed it on the people who poisoned his father. Or something like that. 

Kind of a similar, no not really, deal here. 

There's a great looking tree out back. It's not cut down. It creates a good vibe to hang around. It's the tree house environment you never wanted as a kid growing up in Brooklyn. 

The drinks, while alcohol is technically poisoning you, the people who make the drinks here don't do the best job of hiding it. This is a pick your poison bar. Great for it's happy hour and it's in close proximity to the Barclays. 

If you're hungry, there's some great pizza next door. And on Wednesdays they have some fun trivia. Not sure if it's a big cash prize anymore. 

Overall, it's an alright place. I come through it's doors every now and then, but it's never a place I'm super excited to come to. More of a place to mix it up, or if I just happen to be on 4th avenue and in need of a drink.",0.0
"I had a great experience with max.  I have been home sick and wasn't able to physically leave the apt to get what I needed from the grocery store.  I stumbled across max when looking for same day delivery in NYC.  I ordered by 10:40am and received my order in an hour and a half.  Insane!  Few things to note, they don't deliver above 34th st on the west side and 26th on the east side.  Their website gave me issues the first time I tried to order and it took me a bit to place the order since I had to restart my iPad.  But once all of that was done, I was thrilled.  I don't know what I would have done without them!  I was surprised how hard it is to find same day online delivery in the city.",0.0
"I gave this place another chance after 3 months, because I was hoping they had changed. If you have a special dietary need such as you don't eat PORK or are a vegetarian DO NOT EAT FROM HERE!! I specifically ask that my burgers are not cooked where PORK has been prepared. And two times, my burgers arrived tasting like bacon! The manager told me today ""Sorry but bacon is cooked on the grill"" and that they only have one other side of the grill where they cook the vegetarian burgers. But, if you are not cleaning the entire grill of bacon grease, then how vegetarian are those burgers?? IT was too much trouble for them to clean the girl of bacon grease before preparing my burgers? If someone has a food allergy, shouldn't the restaurant also accommodate those people? EVERYONE doesn't eat PORK!  Did they think i wouldn't taste the bacon?? If you don't eat meat or pork, you will taste it straight away!!! This restaurant is disgusting!! I took one bite of that nasty swine infested turkey burger and now I have the taste of PORK bacon in my mouth and will probably be SICK like the last time. I will NEVER, EVER ORDER FROM A LUCKY'S FAMOUS BURGER AGAIN! I'' DONE! They don't consider special dietary needs! And if you are a vegan DON'T trust them. Because they are cooking burgers with meat and pork on the same grill!! GROSS!!!",0.0
"Totally bland. I was craving udon so I had the noodle soup with tofu, spinach and mushrooms. It came in a huge bowl of what was basically just hot water. The tofu was raw and tasted like, well, tofu. This is fine in something like a miso soup in which the base actually has some flavor, but in this soup it was just insulting. Hubs ordered the lotus root and chili pepper but there were no peppers to be seen anywhere. Again, zero flavor. The veggie dumplings were ok once you dipped them in the sauce, but were otherwise meh. 

I'm so sick of chefs who think vegetarians must not like their food to taste like anything. I mean, who do they think they are catering to?",0.0
"The pictures posted on Yelp are very deceiving...

What I wish I had known
- Very small sitting space
- Awkward table set-up with old benches and stools
- General lack of hygiene (marks on my spoons and plates. Yikes.)
- Cash only, and you order/pay at the register 

Makana is set up to be a mainly take-out restaurant. Yes, food is cheap, but for what you are getting, you will be paying more for future medical problems. 

My ""106 Deluxe"" - 6 pieces of sushi or sashimi with a roll fell flat. (What was I thinking ordering sushi from this sketchy looking place, anyways). BUT I did not get sick afterwards, so I deem this adventure mildly successful.",0.0
"I walked in and was greated by Eddie, Saul, and Jeff, the managers and owner. They have charging stations right by the tables which are very convenient. The place has awsome decorations, a sick sound system, and good lighting that isn't too cluby. And to top it off 65 huge tvs with every game you could want.

First we had the nachos which were amazing. The chips were still hard and crunchy despite being cover in all the cheese, chili, quacamoli etc.

Then we had sushi which was very freah and tasty, I'm not a very big sushi person so I can't really elaborate. 

Next came the other appetizers. The mozzarella sticks were fried perfectly and the homemade marina sauce was to die for. The NYC style hot pretzels were better then any street cart in the city and it came with an amazing mustard that I can't even start to explain.

 Saul, Eddie, and Jeff kept coming to check on us throughout our meal and our waitress Lauren was very knowledgeable and friendly. The fishbowl was very cool amd even came with little Swedish fish swimming in it.",0.0
"Um when eating from this restaurant I would avoid any dish that comes in goopy sauce i.e. ""pepper steak"" ""any meat w mushrooms"" ""any meat in black bean sauce"". They're pretty stingy so you won't even find crushed garlic in that sauce, just tasteless corn starchy brown oil goop. Did I mention oily? Yeah for some reason all the dishes in sauce are pretty goopy and OILY. So I suggest you stick with anything that is deep fried (i.e. chicken wings, scallops, fried wantons) as they cook at such a high temp that they absorb little eye or go with a chicken w broccoli or chicken w mixed vegetables. Also 9 times out of 10 the eggdrop soup is watered down. So um....I rarely eat here except when I get really really sick of everything else around here.",0.0
"I ordered from here on delivery.com and the food got here in under 20 minutes, which never happens. Woo!

The delivery guy asked me to come down, which is annoying because I order delivery when I am feeling like Jabba the Hut and want to commit the deadly sin of sloth. I found it in my heart to put on pants and walk down the four flights of stairs. Boo!

I ordered three lunch rolls for under 9 bucks and it comes with a soup.The menu is limited. They have standard rolls, but they only have bare bones a la cart sushi and sashimi offerings. My Alaska roll did not contain raw salmon. Yep, you read that right. It was the flaked/chunked salmon that comes from a can like tuna fish. Would the tuna roll be tuna fish, I wondered?

The spicy tuna roll and shrimp roll were edible, but had the quality that Duane Reade sushi would have. They have Spicy yellowtail and spicy tuna rolls, but not plan yellow tail or tuna rolls on their menu, so I wonder if they get all of the spicy versions pre made in a tub and don't order fresh fish. At least I don't have to worry about getting sick from this place since nothing was actually raw to get me sick. 

I wouldn't order here again but it would probably be fine if you are in the mood for cheap as hell gas station sushi. I am the first to review here, but I have a feeling this place isn't going to be in business very long.",0.0

Hopefully someone will read this and talk to their kitchen - I have a feeling it is probably one cook vs. another being better informed on gluten free cooking procedures.

"If you want to get sick eat here. 
I took my girlfriend here while visiting NYC since she is Czech and wanted to have some authentic Czech food. She ordered the chicken schnitzel lunch plate. It came out under-cooked. So much the inside was still pink. Most chicken contains Salmonella unless cooked thoroughly so this was not only unacceptable -  but bacteria ridden. She returned it. Instead of cooking up a new one the ""cook"" just added more batter and threw it back in the fryer. When it came back it was the texture of dried shoe leather and almost impossible to cut. Inedible. When she kindly asked to speak to the owner or manager it turns out he wasn't there. No one there was Czech. She kindly asked the ""cook"" about returning it and getting her money back. He noted she had already eaten the potato salad. He defended the chicken shit meal like it was normal and look how many people eat here. At this point I got up and voiced loudly the fact he served an undercooked raw chicken and then returned one that was consistent with a shoe sole. He got angry and indignant. That somehow we were in the wrong. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE UNLESS YOU CRAVE CRAP FOOD AND ABUSE OR GETTING BACTERIAL DYSENTERY.",0.0

"Went here today for lunch.  I had the chicken salad.  It was real chicken chunks and not too much mayo which I loved.  It was on whole wheat and it was generous.  Here is the downside, on paper it says their chicken salad sandwich is 4 and change, then they guy makes the thing and writes 5.10 on the wax paper covering the sandwich, now I get to the register and the cashier rings it up, it comes out to 5.55.  Not that I am surprised by this practice, just sick of it.  I will go back its a better deal and a better sandwich than some of Pret's.  I will just have to add at least 1.75 more to the cost than what is posted on paper.  They have outside seating which is nice.",0.0
"I really liked Ribalta. No love affair here, but a great space which upon entering is filled with the most delicious of smells. My party of 7 had no problem grabbing a table at peak lunch time and service was great. 

The food:

We ordered 2 orders of the octopus, an avocado salad and the mozzarella salad along with 3 pizzas. This ended up being the perfect amount of food. 

The octopus app was about two tentacles served smothered in a tomato sauce with olives. People really enjoyed however I did not. Too much sauce and not enough octopus. 

The salads on the other hand were delightful. Bright colors, fresh ingredients and plenty of the good stuff (avocado and cheese), I definitely recommend. 

The pizzas: 
1. The Americano topped with French fries and hot dogs. Eh? I mean for the novelty factor and pictures, why not, but everything else about this was average.
2. The 4 cheese - yes, yes and yes. Lots of strong flavors here and I enjoyed them all.
3. The Ribalta - topped with not so strongly favored sausage and broccoli rabe(?). This one lacked strong flavors (although, I'm a bit sick and taste buds are a bit muted) and I enjoyed it, but thought it could have used a bit more oomph.

Overall, a solid spot for pizza and salad in what seems to me, an authentic Italian eatery and ambiance/vibe.",0.0

"I had dinner at the restaurant on a separate night and had a nice low key dinner. It was a Wednesday. Food was awesome, waitress was super sweet and honest if she was unclear about something and would offer to ask someone else and come back with a response. I admire that- we don't all wake up knowing how to a certain job. I did feel like the people in suits that came up to is were nice and made sure we we enjoying ourselves; however, it seemed like everyone is manager? 

We had a nice dinner so we rounded up a group to the lounge Saturday night. Such a bust! We got there around 11:45. We heard it is the hardest door in the city and it is going to be very very exclusive- love that idea. There was a huge line, got right in. The place hardly got packed, which seemed nice. Music was low key and boring but we figured they're just getting revved up for the night. Wrong! The music was horrible and people were not flocking in, but flocking OUT! I have been to every hot club in Manhattan and we always pay premium for bottle service (I realize how obnoxious that sounds but just helping people out especially ones that love a good night out like myself), but when the music sucks and we are the ONLY ones there by 1:30, there is something wrong. I get the low key music (I'm sick of edm rave like clubs anyhow) but seriously it was music my grandparents listened to. So if they are trying to attract people in their 50's then they should keep doing what they're doing, but for us mid 20's to early 30's better off at electric room or no. 8 especially if you're buying bottle service!

-Order took 1.5 hours to deliver 4 blocks 
-Order arrived cold and incorrect
-Soup came (cold) with crackers already in it, giving the sense that it was recycled from a customer that didn't finish
-Grilled cheese (cold) had about 1/2 pound of muenster cheese, was made with some odd marbled bread and definitely microwaved instead of grilled

I almost knew what I was getting into with this place, but I was sick and needed soup.  Needless to say, my sickness was made worse.

To my dismay I order the $7 friedmans lunch bowl of chicken matzo ball soup and what arrives 30 min later? Bland soup that tastes like celery... Pure celery and no chicken. There was one piece of shredded chicken and a tiny sliver of chicken SKIN. Here's the best part... The matzo ball tasted like a ball of fresh dill, a dense packed ball of dill...

The menu is very extensive (fish balls, noodle soup, fried noodles) and everything looked pretty good. I ordered the fried hand pulled beef noodles, which was only $6.50 and delicious! However, my main concern is the sanitation of this place. There were flies everywhere (probably attracted to all the dirty dishes that were left out). The kitchen was closed off so I didn't see how clean it was back there, but hopefully they take care of their food at least... I use to live in China though where basically every cheap resturaunt looks unclean so I didn't let the dirtiness of this place stop me from trying it. Their noodles are yummy and at a good price so I'm glad I went, but I REALLY hope I don't get sick after this. There is another hand pulled noodle place in Chinatown, Lam Zhou, that also serves delicious noodles and is much more clean so I'll probably stick to there from now on.",0.0

"So since I've posted my previous review, the waitress that served me that night sent me a private message in response to my review basically insinuating she was the owner or something. Claiming that everything I said in my review wasn't true and she had me on camera and she said I even turned around to say goodbye to her. She also states I was disrespectful to the cleaning guy, which is completely way off the mark, because he and I exchanged a few friendly words and had a laugh when I said to him, ""wow this place emptied out quick"".

So in her little tantrum, she tells me that ""She's sure the waitress told me the kitchen closed at 10:40"". Even if she did which she didn't, the sign says they close at 11pm. She claimed that I was ""barely eating and just on my phone"". I ate every ounce of my food as quickly as humanly possible without making myself feel sick.

She then went on to comment on my back issues. Yes my darling I have back issues. And because someone has back issues it doesn't mean they have to act up everyday. It's common sense, and not any of your business.

She then goes on to tell me ""You're a No Life B-word""  I can't say that because it's not allowed on here and she said it in capitol letters I might add. Then she said I was ""TERRIBLE PERSON"", and then she called me the C word, and then told me to go ""blank myself"" (I can't say those swears either because they are not allowed. I'm posting her message to me with the swears crossed out. 

So like I was saying before, If you want to go some place without good service and then when you write a review about it have some little girl write bad things to you, then go here. I actually at this point feel bad for the owners, because having someone like this, who can't do their job properly and then can't control their temper is just not giving them a good name. I used to come here on a and off for a while and there used to be a really cool guy waiter that was always welcoming. It's a shame. Hopefully the owners will address this properly.",0.0

I would give it 4 stars but it gets a star off as I noticed an employee not washing her hands after using the restroom. Kinda gross no? She walked into the kitchen afterwards then my food came out...

"This is my third time here, and the worst overall experience. For a party of 2, we were told we would wait about 20 minutes. We waited over 30.. I guess that's normal at an ayce place. 

Once seated, we didn't have a waiter for about another 5 minutes... actually she wasn't even a waiter, it was just a woman who asked us what soup base we wanted. I apparently had to wait for someone else to place my meat order. We only had a plate and a spoon. We had to ask for chopsticks, a bowl and those metal spoons for hotpot and no one brought us water.

They do have a good variety of vegetables for an ayce vegetable and fishball place. Not a big fan of their sauce options. Everything looked straight out of a can. The soup ended up having way too much MSG, my bf and I felt sick afterwards. The waiter barely visited our table the hour we were there. It was like we constantly had to flag down people to refill our water and hotpot soup.

"I didn't plan to hook up last night, but this place kind of draws you in and keeps you there, late late into the nite. 

My friend and I ordered about 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. They were out of a few things I wanted so I ended up getting the steak. My friend got something fancier - some pasta seafood dish i think with something I can't pronounce and wouldn't eat anyway. 

I get the impression this place does the basics really well. Like you can't really screw up a good steak and if you do you're a mental midget and shouldn't be working in a professional kitchen anyway. Mine was cooked perfectly - seriously seared on the outside and just raw in the center. Plus their fries are ADDICTIVE.

My friend's dish on the other hand was mushy and bland. Didn't even come close to finishing it. So it goes. 

Drinks are right on. Started with two martinis - stiff and large with an olive, not a twist. Then we moved on to some aperitifs while we headed for the pool table. That's when this place actually gets fun. There's a late night energy here that really seems to take off once the more polite diners vacate and the thrill seekers arrive. The DJ is this hot spinster who knows her shit and can even make a party happen with ancient Michael Jackson tracks.

The pool table crowd knows how to play. After about an hour there was a real sense of camaraderie and we were buying each other drinks and grubbing smokes etc. 

I met this amazing artist girl with the sweetest eyes and we just hit it off for some reason. By 1am my friend had to go since she needed to work in the morning. So I stuck around with the new chick while the two guys we were playing against challenged us to kiss. She didn't even flinch. She was on me immediately  - we were so in the moment - just a three second kiss, nothing too overt. And the guys were cool about it and not dogs.

We were pretty drunk but not stupidly so. It was 3am. The manager turned up the lights and gently kicked us out. We were walking down Front Street and I assumed she was taking the F like me. So I turned right toward the subway but she grabbed my hand and pulled me straight telling me she lived in Vinegar Hill and to just ""come on"". 

It was dreamy the whole experience. The next morning we woke up, both mealy mouthed, hung over with that pasty feel that's kind of gross but slovenly comforting at the same time. My new friend looked into my eyes and said, 'The Burger'. What do you mean? 

""I need 'The Burger'. Superfine. They make the best burger."" ""But we were just there. ""The Burger... The Burger.... she just kept repeating it over and over. 

We cuddled for a while and had lazy, hungover sex. It was snowing outside. The kind of day you just want to stay home and make eggs and coffee in bed. And I thought of how so many other people right at that moment were having mealy mouthed, pasty lazy sex and copulating. The idea of the whole neighborhood copulating simultaneously made me feel really gross - people I'd never want to copulate with all doing the same thing I was doing, having lazy sex, copulating and talking about brunch. It suddenly made the night before less unique.

I told her I hated brunch. She replied,  ""The Burger"". 

Fast forward 30 minutes - yeah the burger is efffin fantastic. Perfection on a bun. After their burger and two pint sized bloody marys - the best I think I've had despite there being no celery - my hangover was gone.

Fully satisfied, considering ordering a beer, I took a closer look at my surroundings. There they were. All the people from the night before. Pasty. Pale. Hungover. It made me feel sad and I started feeling sick.

In short - fair to poor.  The sides  were terrible;  cucumber salad, sickeningly sweet  (and $1 extra) and the cole slaw was swimming in mayo - in this day and age, really?  The Roast chicken was not very roasted, with a sweet glaze on top that was not crispy. average to mediocre.

I hope the meats are better.  This cooked chicken with two sides dinner is a must to avoid - go to the chicken place on 85th St which is much better.",0.0
"There is a rare moment that every New Yorker has experienced. It hardly comes, but when it does, you know it. It's the moment that you have found THE restaurant. The restaurant that serves a greater purpose than just feeding you. The restaurant that is there for you in all your times of need. When you're drunk, when you are going through a tough breakup and want to eat your sorrows away. When you were college-student-broke. When you were first-corporate-job-rich. When you need a midday snack. When your friends are in town. When you're happy, when you're sad, in sickness and in health, to have and to hold until death do you part. 

That restaurant is Woorijip. 

In all the phases in my life, Woorijip is the only thing that stayed constant. I know I can come in any day and enjoy the same Japchae, snack on a roll of Gimbap, or gorge on a tupperware full of Bulgogi. And I know all of it will be sensationally delicious. Everything is reasonably-priced, and will be there time and time again, waiting for you and your next craving. If I could describe Woorijip in one analogy, it would be: Woorijip is the manifestation of your mother waiting by the kitchen table when you are visiting home during college break, with a fresh pot roast and a warm hug (and a rack of soju).

That is what Woorijip is to me.",0.0
"Just getting back from the airport late on a Friday at 830PM. 3 adults and a 8 year old and a sleepy 5 year old. My wife grew up around this area. When we got in, there were two other people (one other table). I ordered a diet coke and a southwest chicken sandwich, wife ordered two eggs and chicken bacon, brother in law ordered a chicken parm, my 8 year old Mac and cheese and finally my sleepy 5 year old a pancake. This order seems to have overwhelmed the very nice staff that was working that night. I went to the bathroom which was fine except when washing my hands noticed a worker in an apron, gloves and a Clorox spray cleaning the sink. Thinking, I am hoping he's not the chef.....Get back to my table without mentioning any of this to my family. The children's dishes came out after about 25 minutes. Mac and cheese looked, smelled and tasted like it had just came out of a store brand box. Pancakes were fine, as plain as plain could be. Another 15 minutes went by, the waiter came back stating that he could not figure out what I had ordered, was it chicken or steak. 40 minutes into this he says he had mistakenly took my order as Steak. I told him whatever he had cooking I would take, steak it is. Another 15 minutes, the food came out. My brother in law's chicken parm looked like still frozen, my chicken that became steak midway was wholly uncooked, and I mean raw leather dog treat chewy type with a chunk of animal fat pasted to the bread. Lots of French fries (they were in addition to my wife's chicken bacon and eggs were the only edible thing around). Oh yes, my older son by now asleep did get a free vanilla ice cream.  I brought my steak for my German Shepard's consumption (I will wait and make sure I am not food poisoned tomorrow) before I subject her to the meat. My brother in law could not bring himself to make bring it home for the puppy (he loves dogs too much, I guess). We spent $80 with tips and left hungry and worried (still wondering about the shady short order cook looking guy cleaning the bathroom). 

In summary, this place needs to be put out of it's misery and quick. You get more bang for your buck and better chances of escaping dysentery eating at your average mobile shish kabob cart with a rusty van next to it!",0.0
"I have lived in the NYC area for 4+ years and I have never experienced the terrible service that I had at Jaiya tonight.  Our appetizer was great, we had veggie dumplings.  We shared a kale salad that was ok.  Then our entrees came and I ordered shrimp with cashew nuts and brown rice.  There was something in this that made me feel sick; my mouth was burning and was stomach felt upset.  I didn't complain to the waiter at all, I just asked him to take my plate away.  The dish came with 3 shrimp (smaller portions for a thai restaurant) and at this point I ate about half the dish and 1 shrimp was left.

I never asked him to take the meal off of our check, I was happy to pay for it, I just felt sick from eating it.  

Our waiter's name was Sal he was the sweetest man; someone should hire him to work at a better restaurant.  This review is about an overweight Asian woman (I didn't catch her name) who also worked at the restaurant.  

She came up to me and said that ""this is the last time we will take your meal off of your check, you ate almost all of your shrimp"" in a rude, condescending tone.  This was our first time eating at this restaurant.

I explained that I didn't even care about the check, it was fine, and Sal was so sweet.  She proceeded to tell me that I ate too much of my dish and was causing a scene at the restaurant.  Finally my boyfriend jumped in and said it didn't matter because we would never eat here again after the way she spoke to me.

As we were getting up to leave, she continued to yell at me on our way out of the door.  It was simply outrageous.  The hostess and all of the other staff we beyond pleasant, but this woman was one of the most terrible people I have encountered in NYC.",0.0

"Got take out here on the way home tonight and lets just say I would NEVER go back.
I ordered chicken Pad Thai and while I was waiting the tiny glimpse of the kitchen I got was more reminiscent of a cheap Chinese restaurant. I kinda felt at that time that I had made a mistake.
When I got it home I found overcooked greasy noodles with a fishy taste. No spice no flavor just a nasty greasy fishy taste with occasional overpowering hot lemon from the lemon slice that was tossed in there.
I honestly had to stop eating it as I began to feel sick.
I have to say that the take out chicken and Thai Noodles I bought for $3.99 in Trader Joes the night before was FAR superior......and that should NOT be the case!",0.0
"One of my favorite dessert places over the years... still is. Ms. Chika - brains behind this operations - keeps her menu changing with the times...  Where there used to be cupcakes now are her version of the famous 'cronut' (of which she has made about  dozen flavors). Note i said ""her version.""  It would be overly simplistic to say she just makes her 'own version-' she truly transforms whatever it is that she is making into a lighter, fluffier, often less sweet and more variety of flavors, many of them 'asian' such as her incredible green tea milliecrepe cake.  

There is usually a bit of a wait - but for New York, it's not bad (perhaps 15minutes).  Come hungry - you'll likely want to order 2 desserts a person given all the options,  the fact that how light she makes her desserts you won't feel sick eating a few, and best of all - it's somewhat affordable!

The only imperfect thing about this place is that its small with limited seating. Small price to pay for a delicious cronut, mochi, slice of cake, cookie, etc.",0.0
"I love Kulu! Although it's really far from me, I would definitely have it when I'm around the area. I'm glad they opened a Kulu in Queens, but I heard it's not as good as the Brooklyn one. 

I've tried multiple desserts:
1. mango pomelo: generous amounts of mango and the mango juice is really good... not too sweet 
2. kulu fruits bowl (never really got the name): it's a bowl with mango juice, with jelly on the bottom, two pieces of each fruit, one scoop of ice cream. It wasn't too bad... but i wouldn't get it again - just too much stuff in one bowl, couldn't really enjoy one thing
3. ginger sweet potato soup: warm dessert that I wouldn't mind in the winter if I'm sick, but not a big fan, the ginger taste is overpowering. 

bubble tea - they don't have any good options, I wouldn't order that there. 

But overall, I love the mango desserts. They're not stingy with the mangoes, which is why I love this place.",0.0
"I've been here on a couple of occasions but I always have a hard time deciding what to order. I tried their crepes twice and they aren't really what I would like to call a quality crepe. The chocolate syrup used with the crepe doesn't taste good. Like I guess there's just nothing that connects all the ingredients together so it feels and tastes very unsatisfying. The crepe also gets stuck to the plate or the little paper that they put the crepe on so it gets a little annoying trying to cut the crepe and get the piece off the paper to eat... The crepe is also pretty small. I also wish the crepe skin thing could be just a little bit thicker and that the crepe itself could be sweeter. I think if you really wanted to eat a crepe, you should probably go to a place that specializes in making crepes.

Next, I've tried the coconut milk tea and thai milk tea and neither tastes too great. I mean they're alright but I get sick of the drink halfway through. 

The sagos are also pretty bland. They're supposed to be sweet but sometimes the fruits don't really have much of a taste or the coconut soup thing isn't sweet at all. 

It's also usually packed whenever I come no matter what time it is but I don't usually come too late into the night. They have a bathroom and tv though so that's nice!",0.0

"I really wanted to like this place, given that the other sushi options in Jackson Heights are god awful. Unfortunately Okawa really isn't much better. Came here once when the place first opened and it wasn't great. Ordered the sushi deluxe and the fish was so flavorless. The quality of the sushi is really subpar.  Since they were new, it would only be fair to give them another chance which I did today, and had the same result. I tend to judge the quality of a sushi restaurant  by its tuna.  If the tuna is good, everything else you order should be fine. The tuna at Okawa is flat out nasty.  It was a grayish color and tasted so bad. Hopefully I don't get sick from it. The reason I'm giving it 2 starts is because the California Roll( which isn't really sushi) and the eel were ok. Service was good as well.",0.0
"The tea was nasty. It tasted like heavily sugared water. I'm from Houston and was just visiting NYC. My sister and I drink tapioca all the time in Texas. It is a huge thing there so we know good tapioca. The tapioca at Kung Fu tea were like balls of overly sweet honey, not the good kind of sweet but the kind that makes you feel sick after two sips. Also, the girl at the register was lowkey rude. I wasn't ready to order so she took the order of a girl behind me, then when I was ready she told me to wait so she could basically take 3 other people's order behind the initial girl that was behind me. So four people behind me got their order taken before me.  I told her I was there first and ready to order but she said ""yes I know. But they were ready first"".... Um okay??? Rude!

"I ordered the Nama Gori Caesar salad to play it safe but was disappointed with the 3 pieces of Nama gori tofu on a bed of unripped kale.  Yeah they should've cut the kale up more but overall it was just a rather boring salad of kale and 3 pieces of tofu.  I was bored and sick of it by my 5th bite. If I hadn't ordered the delicious meatballs I don't think I would've given any stars. They seriously hit the spot and tasted like meatballs with good sauce.  Mmmmm. I had to get the meatballs cuz the salad was just so unsatisfying.  I'm not being a bitch.  I always give credit when credits due. I'm just so surprised because of all the great reviews that say this place is amazing when it's really so not.  In this category, Siggys and  Souen are waaaaaaaayyyyy better and having had this and that to compare to, I'll never say anything bad about Souen's food ever.  Anyways, I also got the broccoli which on the menu I could've sworn says garlic broccoli but it's just plain steamed.  Got the veggie latkes.  Yeah they are waffles but I'm ok with that.  Service isn't the greatest but damn, she must make a killing being the only waitress.  This dude next to me from sanfran was loving the Nama gori panini and said he came here 3x a week.  I think either the food in San Fran sucks or he has stock in this company and has to eat here. I think this is a good option if you want bland organic veggies and you don't wanna cook and you live down the block.",0.0
"I'm giving the food i ordered two stars but will try again at some point to see about some other menu items.  Being one person I didn't want to order too much at a time.

First of all, this was a delivery order through Seamless. And I must say the food arrived in 20 min. They were amazingly fast. And it was hot.

Secondly I LOVE incredibly spicy food. Have had real SIchuan in China and know what it should be. Another thing that seems to be different with Sichuan in the US is that it can be chokingly hot. When I was in China I had some of the hottest food in my life but never choked once. I'm not sure if it the quality of the peppers or what but I've never experienced that heat/euphoria/tingly lipped endorphine hot high in the states. 

Unfortunately with my order (In which I ordered everything Hot & Spicy) it seems that just means they dump a gallon of chili oil on top of it. There is no nuance or flavor when it is consumed with oil. It was just kind of gross.

I ordered the following:
Hot & Sour soup as a benchmark and because I felt like some soup 
Sichuan Pork Dumpling with Chili-Garlic Soy (8)
Spicy Hot & Sour Cellophane Noodles 

1. The soup. It was ok. Very average and very black peppery. I think people forget the fact that the word ""sour: is in the title of this soup. And Chenkiang Vinegar is supposed to be an important component of this dish. There was no sour taste whatsoever so I added some cider vinegar I had and it made a ton of difference. But as most soups that sit in a big pot for hours upon end, the tofu was dead and the tiny bits of meat were a bit mishy and suspect. Not many bamboo shoots. Mostly broth. The soup was NOT gloopy or cornstarchy like a previous review mentioned. 

2. Dumplings: speaking of mushy and suspect meat...eek. Someone earlier mentioned cat food. I wouldn't go that far but consistency-wise I would agree. It was soft and mushy and bright pink. Like it wasn't cooked. But it was i hope. We'll see if I get sick right? And because I ordered it extra spicy it was bathing in red oil. The soy part of the sauce was hard to find and unless I would have whisked it to emulsify it would not have been tasteful. I tried to skim as much as I could off and eventually tasted what was a very nice sweetened soy-garlic sauce but the oil ruined it. The dough had a nice tooth but was a tad thick and just folded in half. I haven't seen a dumpling folded that way before but don't have the knowledge to say if it was wrong or not. 

3. Noodles: the BIGGEST issue I had with this dish was that it was under the COLD appetizers (#13). I was looking for a nice little dinner of soup, dumplings and a refreshing spicy cold noodle dish. Needless to say they were piping hot!!! Well that just freaked me out from a sensory standpoint and certainly didn't gel with what I was hoping for. Oh well. But I warn you all it is not a cold appetizer. This dish was huge. For an appetizer it filled a super large (bigger than quart) container. As with the common them of this review...bathed in oil. It might as well have been a soup. The top inch had to be solid oil. And flavorless oil. It had a ton of spice but that is it. So the dish was basically tasteless and oily. The noodles themselves were good and had excellent texture. In fact to give it flavor I added a bunch (after draining them) into the Hot and Sour soup to give it more substance. The vinegar I added to the broth really helped the noodles as well.

I really wanted to try some more traditional and authentic dishes like duck tongue, frogs and lamb but i'm by myself and some of the entrees are quite pricey. The fish and seafood dishes all sound good too. But now I""m a little nervous to retry the place. 

I'm not sure if living on the UES is just a curse for mediocre food but so far I have found only one place I've returned. That is the best kept sushi secret in NY on 93rd between 1st and 2nd called Koito. I haven't been in the city long but I'm starting to feel that the beauty of having everything delivered is not worth the lack of quality that arrives.

"I wish I could rate this a Zero!! I went yesterday, October 20th 2013 with my family of 9. The man in the front says oh I'll give you a deal on admission price. it came out to 37 dollars.

There was a terrible vendor who served tasteless food and stale bread charged 22 for 2 hamburgers and 2 shishkabobs. Then we began to look for pumpkins.... The pumpkins were all brusied and mot were missing the stem. We finally found 2 ok pumpkins paid more money to buy them and went to find a spot to paint them. When we asked the woman who was giving out the paint where are the brushes, she said u have to find one on the table. We finally found one after 20 minutes and the kids were painting their pumpkins. The 2 minute hayride we waited on line for an hour to get on and the man who was driving it is obviously not all there, he stared everyone down with a nasty look.

"We wanted to try some good Italian while in NYC so we looked at the ZAGAT list of best restaurants in town. We decided on Pepolino based on their online menu, which turned out to be outdated. Regardless of this initial setback, we were happy with our choice. 
We started ordering the polenta. I'm not a fan of polenta, but the sauce was so good the polenta was barely noticeable! 
My brother ordered the spinach and ricotta gnocchi with butter and sage sauce. I wanted to try the gnocchi as well, but having tried butter sauces from several upscale restaurants in the last few months, I was hesitant. Butter sauces I had tried before were just too buttery and made me sick. So I asked for a creamy sauce instead. The chef was hesitant about the change but was willing to accommodate. 
When our dishes were served, I tried the butter and sage sauce from my brother's gnocchi and it was really good!  Nothing like the other sauces I had tried before. I hereby apologize to the chef for replacing his brilliant choice of sauce. However, the creamy sauce I got instead was also really good. It might have a lot to do with the fact that the gnocchi itself was outstanding. Having a chef being flexible with picky eaters like myself is definitely appreciated. For dessert we tried the panna cotta. The sauce was supposed to be strawberry, but you couldn't really tell.",0.0

I had the balls to ask him to take a picture with me for yelp!! He not only said yes.. He told me to come behind the bar!! SO I DID!! We took a picture and then he let me ring the cow bell!!

"Is this place under new ownership? It's now terrible! I ordered a few times since my review last year and noticed that the quality had gone down and decided to order one last time over the weekend. This last order was downright abhorrent.  The boneless spare ribs were almost pure fat and we're actually ice cold.  The sauce must've been a new recipe because it tasted like hot and sour sauce, not the usual flavors you expect from the ribs. I also ordered shrimp dumplings which they were out of and substituted pork dumplings instead. Fine. Except they literally tasted like rancid meat.  I couldn't eat them nor did I want to for fear of getting sick. I just got over a cold so I'd rather not wreak havoc on my recovering system with rancid meat. Lastly, I ordered a shrimp spring roll and received a shrimp egg roll. Again, fine. But it was reeeeeepulsive. I took one bite and was overcome with the flavor of old, stinky cabbage and freezer burnt egg roll wrapper. 

I really used to like this place and in a matter of one year I loathe it.

First incident. My husband has a gluten allergy so I figured his safest bet was an arepa de choclo. The waitress assured him there was no wheat in the arepa. He even had the waitress check with the baker and no wheat. WRONG!!!! There was wheat in the arepa. He brought a sample of the product and as soon I bit into it, I knew this arepa contained wheat flour in it. Why lie and take the risk of getting someone sick. Are you that greedy? 

So I tell hubby never to go back, but he does because he's always on the road and this time, he orders an empanada de cambrai. Why not? They looked plump and freshly baked. After he pays and he's well on his way, he opens the bag only to find a flat, stiff and unappetizing empanada de cambrai.

"I have yet to try some of the other express Indian places in the city and can't authenticate it but this quick-serve restaurant is outstanding. Perhaps there are better, and there certainly is worse. However, when compared to the general average of what one can receive in Indian food -- in sit-down restaurants, or wherever -- there is little better. I have yet to stray from the vegetarian options, but the flavor of each dish is so distinct that I can imagine their meat dishes to be very good as well.

The price is reasonable for lunch, and the service is so quick and on-point that you can eat/pay in about fifteen minutes. Also, I've never been sick from their food, which is very important amongst the smaller businesses that might lack the health consideration of corporate dining.

The small complaint is that their naan takes a bit of time to come out because they heat it up when you order it -- so there's a delay, especially if you want to eat it with the meal.

There's apparently an excellent Indian place in Parkchester that is of similar excellence, so I will see how it compares . . .",0.0

"After searching an website for dog friendly places to eat, me & my little family met a friend at this sweet little cafe.  The sun was shining so it was perfect to grab a seat outside.  The wait was short & there were enough new four legged friend to meet to keep us entertained.  The dog friendly corner fountain is a nice touch.  
I was kind of surprised when I saw the menu as it reminded me of a nice diner from back in my days in Jersey but the prices were a little higher.  I opted for on of their exotic burgers, they serve elk, buffalo & the such.  The burger was nice & juicy but I was disappointed that there were not any options for actual dogs.  A little section would give been nice for a special treat.  Plus there were ingredients in the people food that would make dogs really sick like chocolate, onions, etc.  I am very careful around my dog but if a place bills itself as dog friendly than there shouldn't even be the chance.  I like the concept but a little more care & though has to be out into places like this.",0.0
"I follow a sugar-free diet year round but I do like to indulge in a sweet treat once every few months. I felt like cookies and ice cream at the same time, so decided to try out Melt. I admit, I wanted to try one of each, but the shear size of them makes that impossible. I do wish they had minis available or at least available all the time so first time customers can try different ones out to find their favorite. Anyway, I went with the Thick Mint since I'm obsessed with anything peppermint. The size was a lot bigger than I thought which is a plus! I did have to allow the sandwich to thaw a few minutes so it was easier to bite into. The first bite was kind of a shock, the peppermint flavor was a tad bit overwhelming...and this is coming from a peppermint junkie. They can definitely afford to cut back on it a bit, but it didn't ruin the sandwich at all. A friend I was with absolutely hates peppermint but she shared it with me! Since I never eat sugar, when I do, it tends to make me feel sick to my stomach, but this didn't happen at Melt! It wasn't overly sweet and I didn't get the usual nausea I do when I indulge in sugar after long periods. I honestly wanted to go back a few minutes later and try the Elvis but I had already made the walk back to the train. Other than the treats, the staff was very friendly and welcoming when I walked through the door. She explained all the sandwiches and specials to me and even asked how my day was going and if I had any further questions. I will certainly be back because I must try them all! And hopefully give this place its 5th star.",0.0
"Frying Pan is one of those places you have to go to at least once because it's an experience -- I mean, you're drinking on a boat in New York City! And you're rocking (Like, you're really rocking because, you know, you're on a boat.) If you get sea sick easily, I'd steer clear of the top deck; that's where we sat and we were definitely swaying. With that said, though, the top deck does have the best view, so I guess my advice would be to pick your battles? (Actually, my advice would be to take a Dramamine prior and drink your pretty, little heart out on the top deck.)

Going back to the view, though -- it really is beautiful. And when you're on a boat, you're drinking, you're eating and the wind is blowing in your hair...it's hard to have a bad time. I'd describe the atmosphere as pretty chill and relaxed.

For drinks, we ordered pitchers. I'm not sure if they actually have a drink menu, but, in any case, beer is appropriate on boats. (It's not a yacht, guys. Forget about top shelf.)

I deducted a star because I thought the food was average and that there should be more options. I know no one comes here for the food, but still... I had the veggie burger and my friend had the crab cakes. The veggie burger was fine, but I ended up eating more off my friend's plate than I'm sure he would've liked.",0.0

"The Bad
- Protein sides range from $5-6 (this is a huge increase from their original prices)
- Chili hoisin brussel sprouts-- too salty
- Korean BBQ tofu-- it use to be good but it started tasting over seasoned 

The Good
- Grilled kale side-- no complaints here
- Turkey meatballs (only if you're lucky)-- inconsistent texture (sometimes soft but sometimes really rough)
- Kale shredded beef-- nothing special but not bad
- Curried cauliflower-- no complaints here either
- Quinoa-- good since they mix it with kale and veggies
- Juices/Smoothies section
- Stamp card system

The Bottomline: I'll come back when I'm sick of the Dig Inn nearby. Prices of Kale sides are a tad more than Dig Inn, which I do not appreciate. Overall, they do have a good pricing for their small and large dish, just try to avoid getting protein sides. Also, it would be nice to include some seafood type of protein such as salmon or shrimp.",0.0

The size of the ramen is huge and would be ideal for someone who is really hungry. I got the Vegetable Tofu ramen and asked for it to be spicy. There are a lot of vegetables in it and an egg. The noodles are a good consistency but I felt like overall it was lacking flavor.

"This place should get zero stars. Yes the food was tasty and authentic AND I personally love a good ""hole in the wall"" AND can tolerate a little dinginess in my eating establishment, BUT this place was filthy! I even tolerated the people handling my food with their bare, grimy hands, but when roaches started crawling on the table while I was eating, I had to draw the line. I completely lost my appetite so I threw away my food and left. Then I looked and saw that their grade from the DOH was pending. Looked up why and found out that the health inspectors came to the same conclusion as I did!

So, I agree with the other reviews that the food is memorable but the unsanitary conditions are unacceptable and dangerous. Someone will get sick, likely already has. I would prefer they increase their prices, buy some gloves for food handling and hire a cleaning service. You have an authentic product, so have some pride in your establishment and respect for your customers.",0.0

"DREAMING ABOUT THESE. UGH. 
KILL ME.

Every one of my friends and family know I am a sucker for sweets and well, these cookies are the size of my whole hand, about an inch and a half thick, and ooze yummy sugary/buttery goodness. x__x 

Each cookie is probably 500-600 calories but who cares, I'll eat 5 of them in a day. That's the thing--these cookies make you FORGET your conscience..in fact, they brainwash you into stuffing those cookies in your mouth and not feel guilty. ...Okay maybe a little guilty once you  get a huge sugar high and feel a little sick to your stomach (but ya know, that's all my own my fault). 

Anyway, when I stopped by (around 3-4pm on a Saturday), there wasn't much of a line (lucky for us!!) and we got to order our cookies pretty quickly. 

WHAT WE GOT:
1. Oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookie (and got some to go as well):
They were divine. Cookies were cooked through, but still SO INCREDIBLY gooey on the inside, and nice and crisp on the outside--OH my god my taste buds were thanking me--The chocolate chips literally melted into gooeyness as you pulled the cookie apart. The oatmeal raisin was beyond perfect too.

Tips: 
--These cookies are decadent so ordering some milk with your cookies will definitely be the way to go.
--Share this with a friend if you want, because I'm sure 1 cookie equals to at least 2-3 average-sized cookies
-- Come during hours that aren't as popular to avoid a long wait/line. 

STAFF:
Super friendly! They were very cheery and made the experience even better.

ATMOSPHERE: 
It's a very small bakery where you walk down a couple steps into the vicinity--there are 2 stools inside, and a bench outside. Not much room, but then again, you can walk around with your cookie to burn off some of that sugar ;)",0.0
"So we made a bee line to Momofuku Milk Bar to try their infamous cereal milk ice cream. 

Ok, I have to give it to them... the ice cream does taste like leftover cereal milk. How do they do it??! What happens to the cereal?? How ever they do it, it's pretty spot on. 

I had the cereal milk ice cream with the corn flakes crunch. I definitely enjoyed the corn flakes crunch since it brought back memories when I would put corn flakes on my vanilla ice cream when I was younger (Why won't more people do this? It totally makes sense). Anyway, the ice cream was good, but I think it's too rich for my liking. I couldn't finish my ice cream because I started to feel sugar sick trying to eat it. And it was such a mess eating that thing in a little cup with a tiny wooden spoon. Why can't we get bigger spoons? I'd suggest to maybe share one ice cream between two people. 

New York has a knack for really small spots, and this is one of them. They have a counter by the window where you can set your desserts down. I did notice that the people inside didn't really bother to wipe the counter at all and there was some ice cream spillage. They also have benches outside where you can sit and enjoy your dessert. 

It's really a-ok. I'd still suggest it to other to at least try this place once.",0.0
"Like most people who frequent this eatery, I went into the diner, fully expecting to see a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld. In a disappointment on the scale of the Challenger launch, there was no Seinfeld, there was no Kramer, there was no George, and there was no justice! I thought, clearly these lummoxes don't know what a NEW YORK CITY DINER is, but I'm not one to nitpick, even when atrocities like this have been committed, maybe the food would be this house of lies and false promises saving grace? Alas, I was about to be confronted with prodigious quantities of disappointment. I sat down at a booth and was approached by a waiter, whom I believe was more eyebrow hair then human. He took my order, a turkey club and scurried off. When he returned with my turkey I was horrified and had my bar for all human decency lowered. This turkey was in a club I would refuse membership to. It was dry; it was devoid of sauce or any semblance of moisture. I attempted to aggressively force a sandpapery bite of this gruel into my gullet but my body's standard for excellence ceased its decent.  I called the waiter over and asked if I was the victim of sick joke. He looked at me dumb faced and gaped mouthed, the sight of which swept me into a rage I took out my leather driving glove and slapped him across the face. He ran away, thus refusing my duel invitation. When the manager didn't approach offer his sincerest apology along with shame, I took it upon myself to leave.

Belgian beers, Belgian waffles, a damn good French onion soup, a killer sandwich... what's not to like?  (Well, the ice crystals throughout the vanilla ice cream wasn't good... but nothing made us sick like it did at Chili's so I should be happy.)

Definitely a solid spot.",0.0
"So I had this for lunch one day, and later my co-worker tells me that he was back in the kitchen because our buildings share the same heater and the kitchen was Disgusting!!! Nothing was cleaned and it made him sick to see how nasty they kept thy kitchen. It would be nice if the kitchen were open and you could see before you say there and ate the food at certain places.

"Came here for just dessert, so can't elaborate on their lunch/dinner menu. Service was good, nothing great nor disappointing. Ordered the Sharing Fondue for 2. It was good. Maybe I was expecting something more amazing. Chocolate is always delicious. Portions were good for 2 people. If anything, might get kinda sick of so much chocolate (thought I would never utter those words). Saw other people order different types of desserts that looked good. Would go again to try other items in their menu. All in all, good place. Wouldn't say to go out of your way for it but if you're around, give it a shot. But don't hype yourself up.",0.0
"Food took almost 2 hours to arrive, even though the estimate was 15-30 minutes. Every time I called they kept saying it just left. The delivery guy got to my office building and called me demanding that I come downstairs to the lobby to get it. I was manning the phone because our receptionist was out sick so I couldn't leave. I finally convinced him to come upstairs and when he did, he screamed at me in front of my entire office for not giving enough of a tip (I gave $3 on a $10 lunch special, which I thought was pretty generous, especially considering how long it took). He's lucky he got a tip at all given his attitude and how long it took, and arguing over a tip thats close to 30% is just rude. The food was also cold by the time it got there.",0.0

"I often order take out and sometimes eat in at this place whenever I get a sushi craving. Its really the only option in the hood and so far I'm happy. Whenever I eat in, I get the bento box dinners with teriyaki salmon, beef negimaki, or some sushi combo. I've yet to get food poisoning, so that's good. The portions are pretty decent and the service is fairly attentive. If it matters, the bathroom is clean.",0.0
"I love this place and am a fan of many of their dishes. BBQ is out of this world. If they could keep their prices a bit lower, I think I would go there so often they would be sick of me!! LOL!! They are always packed so they must have found their equilibrium with pricing which is good for them. Kimchi is not disgusting like at the most other Korean restaurants, although not always super fresh, it is quite edible. The only negative (and I don't mind it too much) is that the crowd is very young and quite noisy..Still my favorite Korean restaurant. 4 very well deserved stars!! :)",0.0
"When I penned a review of Cornerstone a couple of days ago and referenced Clinton St. Baking Company, it dawned on me that I hadn't actually ever written a review of CSBC itself. If I had to guess how that happened, it was likely because I was having some sort of all encompassing, postcoital body high after a romp with their blueberry pancakes. They're so good, I don't even feel like a sucker waiting an hour in the cold for a chance to sink my teeth into something as ubiquitous to find as a pancake. But really, these aren't just pancakes - they're otherworldly pillows of enlightenment that make me feel unworthy. 

If you can't do lines, maybe call in sick during a blizzard on a random Tuesday in February or something? I really have no clue when this place isn't bursting from the seams with jubilant diners, but you deserve to have these decadent bundles of joy in your life somehow or someway.",0.0
"I don't know why so many people gave this place mediocre reviews? I'm originally from Bensonhurst and definitely love me some good brick oven pizza. I have no problem giving them 4 stars. We walked in on a Saturday afternoon with a party of 8. We were seated within 15 minutes. The waiter was extremely accomodating right off the bat. Yes, they don't sell slices. Yes, they don't take credit cards but get over it. It's the name stupid! and guess what the pizza lives up to it! There was a perfect proportion of sauce to cheese and you could taste the freshness of the brick oven baked crust. On top of that our two pizza's were ready within 15 minutes. I'm sick of hearing everyone complain of how it's not like the original. Guess what the original isn't even as good as it use to be under the BK Bridge so move on! and if not, have fun waiting on line for 30-45 minutes for pizza. I put this pizza right on par with Totonno's and any other Grimaldi's I've had (Front st & Hoboken locations) I would come back again. And by the way $18 for a large pie is a good price now a days for premium pizza.",0.0
"I could have liked this place. It started off well with an excellent Kale Caesar salad. I was delighted to see Skate on the menu, they obliged me by substituting the fingerling potatoes for French fries. I tasted the French fries first, excellent! My first two bites of the skate was pretty tasty, but that third bite was wrong, wrong, wrong!!!!!  Something tasted really weird, I took another forkful to smell and it smelled like ammonia! I called our waitress over to tell her that it was bad. She was very polite and took it back to the kitchen. The chef obviously didn't smell it which I  suggested and sent the waitress back with the comments that ""Skate has a distinct and strong smell normally"". LOL...really I don't think ammonia is a normal scent for anything. They took it off my tab, I was already full from my awesome salad and the French Fries and was too nervous to eat anything else so I didn't order anything else. Thankfully I did not get sick the next day, maybe because I only had a couple bites.",0.0

"I had the HEAD CHEF'S SUSHI SELECTION / ?????? 65.00 - 75.00 / per person
OMAKASE - The Head Chef's Recommended Assortment of Seasonal Sushi.

It was terrible.  Uni was old and fishy tasting (maybe the worst uni I have ever had; I hope I don't get sick). The kohada was dry and old.  The fatty tuna looked like it was cut by a 6 year old (thin and uneven and oddly shaped).  Everything else was mediocre (very small slices of mediocre fish on decent sushi rice). When I mentioned the uni and kohada were inedible, I was told that they would discount my meal 10% but they charged me $70 (before tip and tax) and the menu price is $65-$75.  Honestly I would pay $100 to not eat it again.  When I mentioned it to the front desk (manager?), he apologized but seemed uninterested.",0.0
"I'm giving them 1 star because honestly, the broth of the soup was very tasty.  Unfortunately that's where it all stops.  I went out of my way to go to Wondee Siam because I was sick and always love a big bowl of spicy Tom Yum soup when I'm under the weather.  I ordered the largest size, ask for pretty spicy and with chicken, at a cost of $10.37.  Ok, it's NY so everything costs more, I'll deal with it if it makes me feel better.  They hand me a very heavy bag and I'm thrilled at the thought of how much soup I'm getting.  Home, I un-staple the bag to find a container 3/4 full and a box of white rice??!!! Who the hell eats white rice with Tom Yum soup?  I've had this in many places prior to moving here and consider myself a Tom Yum connoisseur, this was wrong already.  The soup....no spice at all.  I ended up dumping loads of sriracha in it to have a nice burn.  The contents...chicken & mushrooms. That's it! No ginger, lemongrass, nothing.  I've had it served to me with delicate onion slices and even a bit of tomato, this was a $10 bowl of broth, a bit of chicken and mushrooms. Oh yes, don't forget the rice.  You got it wrong big time Wondee Siam!",0.0
"Just ordered delivery. I've read great things about this place and have been wanting to try it...

We ordered:
Spicy beef- HOT and tasty, good portions of meat 
Fried rice w Chinese sausage- very tasty Shumai
Scallion pancakes 
Hot and sour soup - not the best I've had but good

Definitely a cut above your average Chinese take out place. The ingredients are really fresh and not as drained in sauce and oil as most other places can be. The meat is also high quality and you don't feel sick afterwards. Which is an important thing... Makes me wonder how I've eaten such nasty horrible Chinese food SOOOO many times in my life. 

The restaurant itself is really cool and unique in terms of the decor and has a great vibe. There's also outdoor seating which is on a quaint street and is a cute little patio. This is the sister reataurnt to cafe china which is a major Chinese restaurant in midtown so definitely lucky to have this downtown.",0.0
"home sick and decide that some hot and sour soup, and fried rice with general cho's chicken would hit the spot.  My partner ordered orange chicken with wonton soup.  Everything was hot and fresh but overly sweet and both chicken dishes tasted exactly the same, except one had some orange rind in it.  The hot and sour soup was horrid.  one of the worst I have ever tasted with a nasty sour taste (not vinegar mind you)  and the wonton soup was beyond ordinary and inspid.  The wontons doughy and the filling shriveled up.  Would not recommend them at all!",0.0

"What's really winning me over is the gosh darn Convienant location. Who wants to make the treacherous journey into Main Street central flushing for dimsum or chinese dinner food when you can hop on and off from the highway, eat, and GTFO?

Over the years I am failing to see the outstanding-ness of one dimsum joint over the other because I always go home and 2-3 hours later have 50% chance of #3. Jade asian restaurant and ocean jewel (probably not called this anymore, it's across from flushing mall), are my top choices but honestly... It's all becoming the same. Consistency is the best. Ocean jewel definitely more unique dishes (but $$), but this place is a solid choice for dimsum. Jade asian, I tend to get more food poisoning. 

Worthy to note, I enjoyed the coconut mochi with peanut/sugar inside. Leaf wrapped rice (Jang jiu gai) is tasty. All else- standard not bad *thumbs up*! Recommend. Plus it's cheap. 

Dinner.... I like dinner here. I LOVEEEEE the Alaskan snow crab here. Mmm that sauce! I also enjoy the snails, sauce is amazing. Walnut shrimp is delicious. Love the lobster udon noodles, altho very gingery. I eat the fried rice a lot, it's tasty here with raisins. Sea cucumber taste like nothing, so does shark fin soup. Btw think that's totally banned now so it's all ""fake"". Solid Chinese banquet style dinner. Really like the fried peanuts they give as free app.

Most waiters here are kinda rude probably because they aren't paid well.  The guys in suits tend to be pretty nice though.",0.0
"The chocolate here in terms of the ice cream, chocolate sauces, and hot chocolate is definitely the best I have tried. I am sure the fondue is a lot better than any other fondue you could try in Manhattan. I ordered the swiss hot chocolate and it was definitely delicious and the best hot chocolate I have tried in a restaurant. I would definitely return just for the hot chocolate and chocolate sauces.

I got the Munchies Waffle and thought it was not worth the money because the waffles were cold and not freshly prepared as they were much more dense than they were supposed to be, and I think they were so sweet they could have come from a package. For a place that specializes in so many waffle creations I was very surprised the dessert waffles taste like packaged dessert Belgium waffles for a $15 dollar price. I honestly thought that I would have preferred Waffle House waffles compared to the waffles they served just because of how overly sweet, dense, and unfresh the waffles were, but they were also actually quite small...like a packaged Belgium waffle from Whole Foods. So don't come here expecting to get a nice sized dessert waffle or one that tastes better than a freshly made waffle house waffle. As you can see from the picture, the waffle is completely covered by a small amount of whip cream when it is served. And I actually am not even a fan of waffle house waffles, and I also thought the waffle was so sweet it kind of made me a little sick from the overwhelming sweet taste (I also get a bit nauseous from too much icing if I am eating cake). I actually drank a ginger ale when I got home to settle my stomach. So Max Brenner's does make really overpriced dessert waffle creations and I think any restaurant in the city that makes REAL dessert waffles probably beats Max Brenner's just for waffle quality (and that was the main point of my restaurant search, and I almost went to a Belgium waffle restaurant but unfortunately chose Max Brenner's instead).

The service was also bad. The hostess was a little unclear about if she could sit me at a table when there were three tables open. She said a couple times that she could not sit me at a table because that server had already been sat recently...which isn't a professional response in most good restaurants, I think an appropriate server is supposed to come to you if you want that table instead of sitting at the bar. Then she found a table she did not know was open and sat me there. 

My waiter was rude. He seemed to spot me in three minutes. And he just sat a glass of water on my table (it did not have any ice, but does that come with the culture?). So I had no idea who my server was as he just sat the water on my table and left immediately... About five minutes later I signaled to a passing waiter and said, ""Who is my server, my order has not been taken."" As it is very much against restaurant code to leave someone sitting at a table without a server for more than five minutes at this point! The man who sat the water at my table came over after this waiter signaled to him. By the way, this man had been closing about 3 tabs in front of me while I was sitting there staring into space for five minutes. So, he comes back, and stares blankly at me! At this point, God only knows what I could expect, so I say, ""Hi, my name is___."" He continues to stare blankly at me! I say, ""So, what is your name?"" (He says his name is Charles. I say, ""Okay."" He continues to stare! ""Do you have any recommendations?"" I speak. He confrontationally replies, ""Well, it depends on what do you like."" I consider leaving at this point, but I decide to sit through this, and I say ""I am not sure what I like here, do you have any specials?"" And the whole dinner continues on that kind of awkward, rude, and passive aggressive service expectations. I would expect a lot more from a very expensive dessert restaurant. I also was not the same race as my server and felt like I was receiving a racial attitude, which I would also not expect at this restaurant. If my server did not seem like such an angry person, I would have left with a much smaller tip behind me, but I felt like I was in a weird enough situation to just want to leave without any further problem from this server who was unjustifiably directing a bunch of anger and possibly hatred my way. At another point in the night I also saw him drop a bunch of silverware on the floor which made me uncomfortable.",0.0
"Five reasons I'm sure I'll go back to the modest-looking, very comfortable, and bbq family-style environment known as The Smoke Joint:
 
5. Service with a helpful smile, even in times of a dining disaster. (Imagine holding a sick toddler who gets sick all over you as your dinner arrives to the table.) Our server was a nanny/underpaid ruler of the world by day and sweetly refused my many apologies, brushing it off as a common occurrence. 

4. Tender smoked chicken is the T.R.U.T.H. The right amount of spice, sweetness and smoke in every bite. 

3. Perhaps we went there at the right time, barring the sick toddler, because there was only a 10-minute wait for the drinks and food to come to us.

2. As comfortable and casual as the space is, it's still clean and manages to be date night worthy too.

1. Did I say tender smoked chicken? I was very impressed with this dish and couldn't wait to go back for a redo: the same exact meal minus the sick toddler.",0.0
"There was a point in time where I would write reviews for everything because I wanted to be a yelp elitist; however with nursing school these days, my time has become extremely limited, and so now I only write reviews for the worthy.

I have been on a royal pudding binge ever since I discovered them at paris bakery, so I was ecstatic when I noticed an offer for buy 2, get 1 free of their pudding on my facebook ads (ecstatic because paris bakery will no longer hold a monopoly of royal pudding in NYC, and cause as an asian/broke nursing student, I love a deal).  So on a late Tuesday afternoon with 30 minutes of free time between running errands all day, I quickly stopped by and grabbed one of each pudding flavor and flew out that door to my next appointment. 

Verdict: 
-Green Tea: (one of my two faves) they were generous with the matcha so I could also feel the texture of the matcha, which I am quite a fan of 
-Tofu: (second fave): If you have ever eaten freshly made soft tofu dessert (dafufa), it was kind of like that.
-Black sesame: I wasn't as fond of it, BUT I have recently attempted to make a buttload of my own black sesame royal pudding and I've gotten sick the taste of black sesame, so did I not do that, I'm pretty sure I would have loved it too
-Coffee: Good. It even had that light whitish foam up on top and a thin layer of coffee gelatin on the bottom. (Although I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was more of a thick espresso kind of sauce consistency)
-Mango: good and very fragrant. My study buddies were able to smell it when I opened it
-Strawberry: unlike paris bakery's strawberry that is all vanilla with strawberry sauce on the bottom, all their flavors were completely blended.  I do like paris bakery's strawberry better for that reason, but it was still good

One suggestion that I would like to make is that I would like a thin sauce kinda jam thing on the bottom layer (the green tea kind of had it, but I think it was from the matcha settling on the bottom).  The tofu is fine, although I think it would be cute to put maybe a thin layer of honey of the bottom?

ANYWAY! overall: LOVE it, joint is cute and small and I will return for sure (plus I want to try the crepes).  Some people have bitched about the price, but I think it's about average considering it's NYC and they come in the cutest little containers that I have been using to re-grow my scallions in =)",0.0
"My husband and I have been going to and ordering take out from Georgio's for about a decade.  I can't believe I'm reviewing it for the first time now.  It's just one of those places that always tries to please its customers, so you just keep going and enjoying it but never write about it. We went today, and I said, we should really review this place. 
So, here it is: this place is very good.  The best things about this place are:
- The food is good/safe (never been sick from food here, and the fries today looked really fresh like the oil had just been changed)
- The service is very smooth - the servers are always accommodating requests
- The owner/manager (I should know his name already) is really accommodating and aiming to please customers.  He's truly a smart businessman and very pleasant natured
- The fresh squeezed juices and oreo heaven shake are delicious (I haven't had any other shakes)
- The food is like a diner but the atmosphere is more ""country""
- The bathroom is always clean (huge plus in my book, especially in nyc where a majority of bathrooms - even in more expensive restaurants - are disgusting)
- the delivery is always quick and if I've had problem, they've remedied it

The not so great thing about this place is that the food is not excellent.  It's very good to good.  I don't love the way they make omelets, and I almost always want an omelet when we go out for breakfast.  They're a little too well done for me.  The burgers are good and the fries are usually delicious.  I've tried other menu items and I don't remember them.  I haven't had the bbq sauce in a while (maybe 5 years,) but I remember not loving it.

Like i said, it's very much like a diner with ""country kitchen"" kitsch.  The difference between this place and a diner is the fresh juices/shakes, the clean everything (open kitchen, too), and the exceptional service from everyone on staff.",0.0

"Disappointing! I love sweets, and look forward to experiencing the best sweets in every city.  All lists and recommendations strongly highlighted Magnolia, in particular the banana bread pudding.  Not only is this place overrated, it is not even good, the pudding is awful, it tastes like instant pudding and cool whip.  However the pudding is not as bad as the cupcakes.  I love cupcakes, I love everything about these hand held delicious treats, I'll get a cupcake anywhere, and although I love some cupcakes much more than others, I rarely meet one I don't like, Magnolia changed that.  The red velvet is terrible, the slightly bitter flavor of the cake is topped with a marshmallowy fuzz, that resembles shaving cream more than frosting.  The sweets at this place make you feel sick and have no homemade quality, originality or appeal to them.  You will be much happier going to Sprinkles.",0.0
"Chairman Mao bao extremely greasy, saccharine and cloying. Even the bun is overly sweet. At least it is tiny, otherwise too much of such fatty pork belly might make me sick. 

It's like they tried to make some red braised pork belly, but got impatient and just decided to stick a little piece into a bun before sufficient fatty part melted well with the lean part, the fat really needs to have some time... Otherwise it is just a giant chunk if pork far.

"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC and the one place I recommend to everyone, no matter their budget, cuisine of choice, or ambiance preferences. This place is hands down the best, especially to impress. Aesthetically, I love it even more than the original Tao (uptown). Stadium seating gets me hot & bothered. Long, dark entrance-way painted in gorgeous Japanese geishas is sick and worth taking a selfie in front of. Hostesses and waitresses are hot. Food is obviously a little expensive but worth it. I loved the mapo tofu noodles, which was authentic yet original. Bok Choy was even better than 5-star Asian-prepared. Of course, amazing sushi and instagrammable fortune cookie cake. I wouldn't recommend the steak though, as you can get better elsewhere, but can anything taste bad under the grand statue of the multi-armed Buddha (I actually don't know what that is)? Great drinks, especially the Tao-tini. The atmosphere is unbeatable--upscale, romantic, intimate yet rowdy, classy. You see a lot of promoters here with tables of models though which is testament to how amazing this place really is. Glamorous private rooms over looking the whole ordeal in the mezzanine, caged by intricate wooden designs but observable from anywhere in the massive place. Definitely make reservations in advance. The place is huge. The bar is in the back and much more secluded that the one uptown, which makes waiting much more endurable if you're dumb enough not to make a reservation to one of the hottest restaurants in Meatpacking. The location is amazing, right next to PhD and more. TAO has done it again.",0.0
"After three different feasts here, I've gotta weigh in. 

I'm pretty shocked that a place sitting on the infamous St. Marks gauntlet can be so authentically executed. Every staff member I've encountered there has been extremely professional and respectful. The decor is cute without being cliche, and yet still classy. Even with people clustered around the door waiting for tables, they somehow manage to keep the atmosphere cozy and not too crowded/loud. This in itself is a huge feat for this area of the East Village. 

I originally stopped in to try the xiao long bao (soup dumplings). I've now tried all variations- crab, wasabi, super spicy, and kung fu (regular). They are all delicious, but be prepared to have your entire mouth on fire with the super spicy. I have never met my match in spiciness until I put those in my mouth. 

Don't get so distracted by the xiao long bao that you don't try other things. Some musts: pork knuckle soup (amazing), the leek with pork, spicy eggplant, peashoots, wood ear, and mapo tofu. There is some controversy amongst my dining friends about the mapo tofu- The Bao decided to make it vegetarian, and some people insist that it would just be so much better with pork. Let's be real, most things are, but I still think it's pretty delicious. 

This is one of the few Chinese places that I feel like I could visit again and again and still discover new delicious things. 

Also, you can tell they don't ""cheapen"" the dishes by just adding MSG or corn starch. You leave the table feeling satisfied but not sick, heavy, or comatose.

"Yo: this place is a tourist trap! 

(If you're a tourist, just do it.  You don't really have a choice.  I understand, and I'll forgive you one day.  And besides, if you weren't packed in here with all 17 of your friends celebrating someone's 32nd birthday, I wouldn't be able to call this place a tourist trap.  So... thank you?) 

The most popular menu item is a ""goblet.""  There is a whole look of goblets, which are basically ice, sugar, candy, juice, and probably a shot of some fruit-flavored liquor.  One of those drinks that's fun to instagram but will just fill you up and make you sick without getting you even tipsy.

Of course, there were a lot of birthday parties going on... this place would be great if you are celebrating something that needs a gimmick.

My friend and I each had one martini -- we came when Sugar Factory was new and we like to stay on top of the Meatpacking scene.  I had the Reese's, which was rimmed with peanut butter and actually tasted like a Reese's.  I was pleased.  Her drink was the Chocolate Covered Strawberry.  She found it so sweet she had to water it down to drink it.

"Time and time again I come here and it seems like there's always something wrong every time I do.  I'm getting kind of sick of it.

I've been coming here for years.  They have a great beer list and usually the draft list is good too.  

In the past, I've come across apathetic staff who know nothing about beer down to where the hell a beer is even located in their fridge.  It's really annoying asking questions about a beer when I obviously know more about beer than the bartenders in this so called reputable beer bar.  

Sure the bathroom situation is annoying with swinging doors that don't shut properly and an outside area that is closed at random times, but I still want a good beer - so I kept coming.

The last few times I experienced a draft system that was broken.  The bartender offered bottles instead but most were not cold or they were out.  Blarg.

And the last time I went it smelled like a pet shop.  I'm not even kidding.  My husband and I walked in and it took a few minutes to figure at that is wasn't a person smell but an animal smell.  I worked in an animal lab so I'm well aware of what I was smelling - rats.  Open a window, turn on a fan - something.  It isn't healthy to breathe that shit in all day long and honestly, we couldn't handle the smell after a few minutes. We chugged our beer and left.  This happened to be the one time the bartender was super nice, helpful and offered a well thought-out recommendation.  Where was this bartender the last few times I went when it wasn't smelling like a really nasty pet store. 

I have no idea if I'll be back.  I love the beer but the atmosphere is so all over the place that its a gamble the moment I walk in the door.  You have so much potential, D.B.A., fix yo shit.",0.0
"So I was on grub hub saw this place said why not ?! Cheeseburger ""brooklyn"" Swiss and mushroom . So let's start with that , taste like canned mushrooms !!!  Gross then angus beef asked for temp so I'm guessing this is a beefy burger . But no thin burger ! Then gives you the option of onion ring fries , went for onion rings they gave me 6 ! I should of taken a pic but I was starved . Then my husband got a meatball hero ! Just beyond gross ! Stay away from here . Grey meat ! No taste ! Frozen food taste !!  It's taking me everything to not call and speak to management . I hope I don't get sick from this nasty food",0.0
"I want to start out saying that I love authentic Thai food and I haven't found a great Thai restaurant in NY until I came here, and I was excited to eat here. I loved most of the dishes we ordered. The highlights were the papaya salad, larb, and red curry. I totally judge a Thai restaurant by those 3 dishes and they were absolutely fantastic. The soft shell crab was amazing too. Now why didn't I give this place 5 stars? Well, it's because I'm torn. These dishes were great, but the restaurant served us sour yellow curry. It wasn't a little sour, but very sour. Everyone in my party had a good scoop and at first, I was skeptical of the sour yellow curry as the yellow curry I've eaten in the past didn't taste like this, but I still ate the portion on my plate as everyone else seemed okay. Boy was I right about the sourness because needless to say, I got sick afterwards. The waitress was super sweet and kind after we asked if the curry should be sour. She looked confused and said it shouldn't be and brought it back. She took it off the bill and made a new batch for my table. The manager however tried to defend their yellow curry saying it should be a little sour and that they make it at the beginning of the week and freeze it for the week. I must have gotten a bad batch, but honestly, he should have left it alone. So I'm torn because I had some amazing dishes. Then the restaurant served us food that went sour. Just be careful if you go. But definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in NY.",0.0

"Okay so it's really easy to review this place. 
 
Food:is absolutely great and tasty, generous portions and looks tasty as well (presentation is appealing). They have a great variety of food on their menu I could eat 3 meals a day here and never get sick of it because there's an abundance in options that are all delicious and filling even quick little things to grab a quick bite. 

Price: is very reasonable like I said you get exactly what your paying for their portions are very generous for example a hero with eggs,cheese,turkey sausage, mushrooms, a tuna on toast platter with pickles, fries and onion rings, and 2 slices of pizza costed me a few cents under 20$ which Is a great amount of food for that price in my opinion. 

Service:I ate in once and the atmosphere is great they have bar seats that overlook the cooking area and it's mighty clean you can watch your food from the second it starts being prepared until it's on the plate infront of you. They also have tables which are good for groups. It's always clean inside and everyone is super friendly.

Delivery: never takes more than 30-35 minutes. I live in a 4th floor walk up and the delivery man comes up which is convenient for me because I have 2 young children and can't take them down to get the food every time. Many other places ask me to come down and get it and I think it's kind of rude but I end up asking my neighbor to watch the kids for a minute. They are always very polite and don't mind taking coins which is my case most of the time. 

Overall: get your breakfast/lunch/dinner here and you won't be disappointed!",0.0
"Ug. That's all you really need to know about how I feel about this place, but feel free to read on of you need details. 

I am so sick of this place. There's nothing super wrong with it, but I would never, ever buy meat or dairy from this store.

I occasionally have to pick up fruit or veggies if I forget something at my regular store and they are literally the worst. Aside from the limited selection they are often half rotten when you cut into them, the berries and things typically grow mold within a day (as opposed to three or four from basically any other store) and even things that should be fine like citrus and apples are incredibly flavorless compared to buying them at other stores the same time of year. I'm not sure how they managed to screw up apples and oranges but they have! It's kind of incredible. 

I'm giving it two stars because they do have prepackaged goods that are fine and it is incredibly convenient. It's mostly overpriced - and worth checking the expiration date listed as some of those things come close to being expired but generally fine and nice to have nearby in a pinch. 

I live in the building and I regularly take the path to shop at Fairway, Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Eataly or I'll hike the mile up to Chelsea Market or Citerella rather than shop at this place. Even Gristedes is far better. (Wait. I'm pretty sure I just name checked EVERY other store in New York that I vastly prefer to this place. Ug.)",0.0
"Hands down one of my favorite places for brunch, lunch, cocktails - you name it. I have been here 3 times already and am still not sick of the place. 

Great service - we are always seated right away (provided we have a reservation). Even without a reservation, they are always pretty accommodating and we are seated within minutes. 

Great cocktails - I loved their French 75 (gin, lemon juice, champagne). My colleague really enjoyed the Bourbon Smash. 

Favorite meals - eggs benedict (brunch), toasted ricotta gnocchi, the Jane burger, salmon, the excellent choices are endless.",0.0
"Oh, how bummed I was when Loving Hut closed! Yes, it was a tad cultish but being native NY'er, there is something built inside of me to just ignore the shit and just do what I gotta do. In this case, eat delicious food.

I digress.

So when LH closed I saw the signs go up for this place called V Life. I was still bummed bc it just looked like a smoothie/juice bar and I'm sick of those. I want bad for you vegan food. Well guess what! They have that here too! The buffalo wrap is really good and they also have buffalo wings (all vegan, of course). I love all things buffalized, if you haven't noticed.

Their fries are also pretty amazing. Super crispy- think Burger King but with ""healthier"" oil. 

You guys....they also have vegan treats cakes/brownies/whatever here. And Sweet & Sara marshmallow filled treats. 

The staff is insanely and adorably nice. Almost to a fault. If you don't want to sit and eat while hearing bubbly college students singing along to ""Fancy"" or the latest Rihanna hit, take your food to go. 

Theres super limited seating here so do not plan to stay unless you're going at some weird hour.",0.0
"I moved to the Bronx this year, and found that this was the most consistently decent diner in the area. I went with my fiancee a few times a month, up until my last experience.

I have a serious nut allergy. This is very common, and most places are very accommodating. I had always ordered breakfast foods until this particular day, when I decided to have the roast turkey. 

Roast turkey. When have you ever ordered roast turkey, and had nuts in it? Of course, I found out the hard way that this particular roast turkey did indeed have walnuts in some sort of stuffing found underneath. I ate a few bites, and immediately I knew I had eaten nuts, because I started to feel sick. I alerted my server, and simply asked for him to take back my turkey and remove it from my check.

The server went to ask his manager for permission to do that. The manager was standing maybe 10 feet away from me, behind a partial dividing wall, and I could clearly see him whispering to my server, and shaking his head, occasionally glancing over at me. The server, of course, came back to me with his manager's ""generous"" offer of reducing the price of my meal to the price of a sandwich, since I had eaten some. Never mind the fact that I'm heading to the hospital upon leaving because they decided it would be a great idea to not inform their customers of NUTS in their TURKEY. I mean, it's not like I ordered pecan pie here.

Anyway, I got the manager's attention myself, and asked him to come over to the table (since he is already watching this transaction like a hawk from 10 feet away, we may as well cut out the middle man). I explained the situation, and the fact that my throat was swelling more by the minute, and that ALL I WANTED was for him to remove that one item from my check. I didn't ask for a free meal; my fiancee had certainly enjoyed her whole meal, and I did have a bialy and some coffee, all of which I intended to pay for.

The manager's response alone is the reason I will never go back to Tibbett Diner in my life:

""Fine, you don't wanna pay, you piece of s***?? Then leave! Get out of my restaurant!""

So, I did. Permanently.

I could never support a business run by someone like that, regardless of how good the food is. Go somewhere else. Anywhere.",0.0
I usually go here for fruits and vegetables but on July 16  I purchased chicken there.  I went home to realize the smell of the chicken was putrid.  I returned it right away and the girl at the register told me she was not surprised because people were returning meat all day.  That is horrible to me.  I worry for the people that didn't return the meat.  Did they get sick?  Meat should not be out for sale if It's not refrigerated properly.  This is very alarming to me.  I will not trust Family Fruit again and I pray for the customers that buy meat there.,0.0
"I was excited about the vegan ice cream, especially when I saw that they have mint chocolate chip that actually looks like the cow version I grew up on! It's well priced and delicious. I wasn't thrilled with the service- the guy was nice but was clearly not familiar with the foods beyond selling them, and he didn't do much more than serve me (no smile). The cones said vegan but he said they aren't, and I am pretty sure the cupcake he sold me isn't gluten-free because I felt sick the next day. And it wasn't all that good (Sun in Bloom has much better ones right down the street!). I can't speak to the other foods, but the menu is pretty big, though not all vegan. I'd suggest this place for ice cream (all coconut based), but not much else.",0.0

"I think I would have been very happy with my meal had I just stuck with the chicken korma. The only thing I wish is that they would give more rice. They only gave enough rice to fill a tiny takeout box. But the pakora and sag were pretty lackluster which is why my overall rating is lower.

I ordered take out because I wanted to try something different from my standby Fulton Thai. Plus this place has been open for months and I never tried their food.

I ordered the shrimp pakora, the chicken korma and subbed out the naan for saag as part of their 2 course meal deal for $13.95. I wasnt fond of the shrimp pakora-but then again it was my first time having it. Its basically shrimp dipped in egg and then battered in chickpea flour (if you know what that tastes like). But it didnt taste like they seasoned the chickpea flour.

The chicken korma was really tasty and well seasoned. I didnt like the saag at all.  It was very watery spinach and it was slightly oily. Also it had a taste of ginger that was strong which tasted odd and unbalanced in a spinach dish. 

I ordered takeout because I was too sick to cook. I called in at 715pm and my food didnt come until 815pm and only after I called to complain. This is remarkable because I live less than 3 blocks away (dont judge me I told you I was too sick to cook).",0.0
"I love middle eastern food and I was super excited for their menu, especially since I was super hungry and in a rush. I thought it would be quick, since they just had to microwave the veggie dishes I ordered, but it took over 15 minutes (and they really did just microwave it). When I got the food, it looked awful. I tasted it and confirmed, it was just plain old. The rice was soggy, and the flavors were non-existent. I took it to go and figured maybe I could do something with it at home to salvage it, but then realized that it wasn't worth it. The food was definitely old, and I'm not looking to get sick. I ended up throwing away my whole $10 meal, which is not something I EVER do. I will never go back to this place.",0.0

"This place had so much potential, especially opening up in Washington Heights. I have now given Heights Tavern 5 shots. I've sat indoors and outdoors; come for drinks and dinner; come in the summer, fall, and winter; and had 4 different servers. Each visit was a disaster. 

The food here is actually decent, and it's such a nice and big space, so it's too bad that the service is the worst!

On my most recent visit, two friends and I stopped in for lunch around noon. The restaurant was mostly empty. Our waiter took down our very simple orders - turkey burger with sweet potato fries, regular burger well-done with fries, and BBQ crispy chicken wrap with salad. 

He came back a minute later, asking ""Did any of you want sides with your burgers/wraps?"" Really?

When our food came out, my friend's burger was done medium, and was missing the caramelized onions she had requested. We had to flag down our waiter to have him take the food back. By the time it came back out, me and our other friend had nearly finished our meals. Our waiter was perfectly polite and apologized, but what bugged me was that he blamed it on the kitchen. We just want an apology, not for you to blame it on someone other than yourself! It would have helped if he had then offered to give us a discount, or a gift card, but no such thing was offered. 

By the end of our meal we were so exasperated we just wanted to get out. It also didn't help that their tv's were on TNT, which was playing some sort of crime drama. ESPN would have worked just fine, but instead I had to gag on my turkey burger while watching a poor lady bite into a poisoned cupcake, then start vomiting massive amounts of blood on their huge flat screen tv's.

"I note that a lot of people comment on the cleanliness. Yeah, you're rigth, it's on an industrial strip and it looks beat up. They also use 'artisanal' approaches--which under the McDonaldization of NYC under Mayor Blomberg and his homogenizign crew came to by stamped ""unhygienic"" via the letter-based rating system--and there's kind of a greasy feel. But I can report in all honesty that I live nearby and have eaten here hundreds of times at all hours of the day and have NEVER gotten sick. I can't say the same for the gleaming assembly-line places that rely on their sealed containers to keep junky or rotten ingredients 'fresh'...So if you wanna go old school, Pakistani truck stop, quick and cheap food in astoria I still recommend this place highly.

"Horrible food. 

My co-workers and I ordered from this spot today and it was just disgusting. The herbed fries that came with my burger were cold and flavorless. The herbs on the fries were obviously not incorporated in the batter and it was just a bunch of spices thrown on top of fries. The bun on the burger was soggy and fell apart when I bit into it. The meat tasted bland. Aside from that, my co-worker ordered chicken pot pie, and it came in the form of a soup (which was the filling) in a separate container, with the crust that came completely separately. When we called to complain, the customer service was unaccommodating - very rude.

"PLEASE. DON'T. DO IT! I've always been a crazy fan of sushi, going to different restaurants to sample and explore the amazing different rolls of sushi. Never have I sat down at an ""all you can eat"" sushi buffet and spot it empty. I have stepped inside this sushi place twice; once to pick up a menu and once to actually sit down and try their AYCE; both times only had either one customer or none. Worst way to waste 20$ is to go to this place.

Let's start with the positive:
- The place is clean and small; plates are cute and the furniture is decorative.
- Lunch AYCE is 11.99 while Dinner is 16.99. This is a dollar cheaper than Sake (which is pretty much the best known sushi buffet around bensonhurst)
- Menu is not that small; it has the basic rolls and appetizers.
- Appetizers such as the crab rangoon, which is abundant in fillings, and the fried calamari is delish. But the appetizers totally had us fooled about the sushi.

Negatives:
- Bland! Most of these things were very bland. The rolls were not horribly made, but the taste of them! I've never ate a sweet potato roll that was not sweet at all!
- Other appetizers i hated: Dry kani salad, bland chicken tempura, semi-burnt chicken katsu, Lumpy spicy tuna salad (served with a few slices of avocado)
- The best thing about sushi buffet is their unlimited sashimi. Well I could hardly eat it because it was so sluggish and slimy.. I dreaded eating another piece! I felt like I would get some sort of poisoning from this place, but I don't want to be charged for it. The salmon sashimi, especially, was shapeless and poorly cut thin. FYI I ordered about 6 sashimi and flinched at the first one.
- ATMOSPHERE? During the daytime, it is bright. During the nighttime, it is bright. There is no romantic feeling, thus bringing a date here would be foolish. The (one) TV played a chinese acrobatic show that slowed my mood down even more. 
- CUSTOMER SERVICE? Had there been a good waitress, I would perhaps give it a 2/5. Yet the waitress was the only one working in the front with the chef. She hardly says anything, no smiles, no nothing. She and the sushi chef constantly returned to the back to the restaurant, leaving us to feel like the only ones there. (we were technically the only ones there except for another couple). But it made me wonder how long it would take them to realize if someone were to dine-and-ditch. (of course I'd never do it, but their method of running a business is just ridiculous)

LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS. I ignored that this place has a 2.5 rating; my big mistake and my punishment is a stomachache. I predict this place won't last long at all, and I feel bad to say that about someone's business. Get better staff, workers and redecorate! It's not in a horrible location to begin with. 

P.S. I found a fish scale in my spicy tuna roll. It happens occasionally with other places, but this does not help my first impression.",0.0

"I was craving for seafood today so I was thinking about going to Boat House in Brooklyn. Then my friend told me about this new place in St.Marks so I thought I could give it a try.

Due to its location, the place can get crowded fast at night. The restaurant was new and the decorations are pretty nice. Clean bathroom and friendly staffs. 

I ordered 3 pieces of Blue crab and one order of red crab with garlic butter sauce.
Two out of three blue crabs were bad. I can tell the two crabs were either long dead or sick to death when they were put in hot boiling water. As soon as I open their shells, the smell of dead shell crabfish odor stormed into my stomach. It was a miserable experience. The blue crabs are smaller compare to what I had in Boat House.

The red crab was nice. I only have one complaint about it. Why do I not taste the garlic sauce? Their garlic sauce are plain and tasteless. 

As soon as I got home, I dumped all my clothes in the washing machine. Their kitchen burning smell was pretty strong.

"The food is simply a laughable disgrace, we ordered 3 traditional Greek items for delivery:
- the Telio Hummus was decent
- the Greek Spread was 1-2 tablespoon-ful of each of their 4 items. It comes in a delivery plate with a bunch of pita triangles on top of it to make it seem like the plate is more than 10% full. I wish I took a picture .. quality-wise the eggplant salad was ok, the Tyrokafteri was basically just feta puree (salty!), tzatziki and Taramosalata are better at whole foods.
-  the Greek Sampler, at 25$, is an indignity: see pictures attached. Their skewers (see the chicken) come with 65% onion and 35% meat. The kebab is 75% fat, in the picture you can see a piece which is actually 100% fat, yay! The pork kebab tasted like fish, it really stroke me when my pregnant wife told me (sorry I don't have a picture to back that up, maybe it had gills to tip me off...). The Keftedakia were dry and partly coated in a layer of yellow stuff that tasted as fishy as it looked. Lastly, the lamb is that sorry looking piece of shoe sole at the bottom of the plate.

"""NOBODY PUTS BABY IN A CORNER""

My girlfriend ordered take-out from this place last weekend.  She does not complain about her food and if she does, there will need to be a dead mouse hiding under her curry.  

One of the sides she ordered was the creamy spinach (Saag Paneer maybe?).  She thought it was sour and spoiled - given that dairy is used to make this dish, she did not eat it because spoiled dairy...well, is spoiled dairy.

She called the restaurant to let them know of the problem with the food - not for a refund, not for a coupon, not to bust anyone's chops - it was just to let them know that there may be something wrong with the spinach so perhaps nobody else gets sick (which mind you is not made fresh per your order - it sits in a vat at the counter, chipotle style)

The woman that answered the phone - who we are led to believe is the owner,  vehemently denied that there is anything wrong with the spinach.  She specifically said ""No, there is nothing wrong with our spinach, nobody else has complained"".  Right lady, great logic... We should just ignore all complaints because there is always a first.

My girlfriends responses was ""no - it is sour and tastes spoiled - can you just check"".  

The lady continued to deny any problem with the spinach and hung up the phone.

We had the following
Roti Canai - pass

Beef Rendang (menu subtitle: ""Love me Tender"" hahahaha) - sublime

Belacan Kangkung - pretty good but kinda hard to screw up

"I wanted to write a review to thank the store manager, Andrea for her amazing service today. I was looking for a healthy source of energy / alternative to caffeine and had heard good things about ginsing and maca powder. Andrea gave me very good tips for why the maca powder would be better- it was very good for you and would provide a more sustainable, lasting energy than the short term caffeine buzz. I was also recovering from food poisoning, and told her what my doctor had suggested. She gave me very good tips for foods to eat / smoothie recipes to make with the maca powder that also adhered to the doctors dietary suggestions. Thank you so much for the amazing service! I work near this vitamin shoppe location and will definitely be back!",0.0
"This review is based on an average of 1 store visit and 4 online orders. 
Would love to give them 4-5 stars but I cant. 
My first visit to this establishment was nice, they have friendly people, and the atmosphere was wonderful. Burger was great! I loved the sodas they provided and the sweet potato fries are poppin! 
My second order was online I felt safe enough to trust them to get my order RIGHT! I ordered two burgers well done along with my favorite fries p.fries I call them and a drink. I'm got the delivery so I sat down to eat took one bite chewed and I was fine but by my second bite I was like wait something's not right..I was reading a hot book at the time. I looked and saw pink meat I was literally sick to my stomach. I had to Throw it away. 
My next online order I order my usual 2 burgers p.fries and two sodas I really like this bottled sodas they have. I think it was grape..along with the order I specified for each burger no pink must be meat well done! I got pink meat again. 
Now I'm pissed because these orders were not back to back I gave myself some time apart from this spot and ordering online 
So the third time I ordered the same thing but this time I called and remined them hey look I ordered such and such please cook the meat well done. Explained my past experiences the girl understood she said don't worry. When the order arrived at my home I was a happy camper because there was no pink meat!! Honey I was in heaven that food hit all spots that were empty lol. 
Now the fourth time is when I said good bye because I made my order 2 burgers one soda this time and p.fries both burgers ordered had pink meat in the middle. 
So now I've realized that the only time this spot can get my order right is when I'm in the store itself or calling right after I make my order online. Sorry but no.  
Congrats to your business if I'm passing by and hungry I'll make a purchase if not I'm good.",0.0
"Aesthetically, I love it even more than the original Tao (uptown). Stadium seating gets me hot & bothered. Long, dark entrance-way is sick. Hostesses and waitresses are hot. Food was obviously expensive but worth it. I loved the mapo tofu noodles, which was authentic yet original. Bok Choy was even better than 5-star Asian-prepared. Great drinks, especially the Tao-tini. The atmosphere is unbeatable. It's busy but not crowded, even though there is a wait to be seated. Definitely make reservations in advance. The place is huge. It feels even bigger than the one uptown. The bar is in the back and much more secluded, which would make waiting much more endurable. The location is amazing, right in the heart of meatpacking. TAO has done it again. Would really love to come back here on a date.",0.0
"This used to be a fun gay place. Not anymore when they have the unfriendly straight bartender on duty. All business. Not one smile. (The place wasn't even busy, so he wasn't harried). Cute, in an LA way, but that's it. Looks : 7; sense of humor and repartee: ZERO.  

Also, the wines by the glass are SWILL. And they have the nerve to charge $9 and up for them. Do not order the wine. 
MOST GROSS THING: The bartender did not use an ice scoop the entire time. The ice scoop is that thing REQUIRED BY HEALTH CODES used to scoop ice. This guy put  the shaker directly into the ice with his hand. Yes this is against the health code, yes, matters, yes it can fill the ice chest with bacteria. So do not order a mixed drink either.

The burger seems decently priced at $13, but it's an EXTRA $2 for cheese, bacon, avocado, whatever. Rip-off.

With better restaurants in the area like Le Zie, there is no reason to drink bad wine,  possibly get sick because of unhygienic practices, or be served by a bored, straight, unfriendly bartender. I will not go back. (PS there IS a really, really nice straight bartender that works there some of the time, so I'm not hetero-phobic or discriminatory. But this restaurant has a gay clientele, and is in a gay neighborhood. The manager/owner should know his crowd.)",0.0
"for a work cafeteria, this is one of the best I've experience -and it's far better than the l'Oreal cafeteria I ate at in France!

They have a wide selection of stations - grill, salad bar, healthy entree every day and usually some comfort entree every day. Most days there is also a chef's station that ranges from sushi to a shrimp risotto dish.

sure, I get sick of it since I eat there almost every workday - but I'd be much more sick of it if it was most other work cafeterias. The only one that was better, in my opinion, were the cafeteria's on the Warner Bros. and Sony pictures lots.",0.0
"A store just for rice pudding? SOLD! The rice grains are bigger than the ones in those Kozy Shack packs and less watery. There are a variety of flavors, with about a handful changing along with the season. I wouldn't recommend just getting a chocolatey one by itself. Chocolate poisoning is a thing you know. I usually pair it up with the original. They let you taste everything and if you hadn't had your fill by then id suggest the biggest you go is the epic (unless you're sharing, which in most cases you wouldn't be, cause hello, its rice pudding). Their hot drinks are not hot, theyre scorching, youve been warned. Star off cause the staff could be a bit friendlier.",0.0
"I used to live about 5 min from here so would order often. Now that i've moved a bit farther, i still called here to order since their sushi is consistent. Never had a problem or gotten sick.

I ordered this week (4 rolls) and for whatever reason, they didn't give me the 3 rolls for $9.95 special (mehs!) and i didnt realize till afterwards...booo to them. The kani salad was good though.

Oh and their rolls? My order was the shrimp tempura roll and shrimp avocado roll. Each piece of the shrimp avocado roll was about the size of a booger. I was left wondering if the rest of it was left back at the restaurant :(",0.0
"I come here for sushi at least once a week. One time while I was eating it in-store a middle-aged man walked up to me and asked, rather conspiratorially, like he didn't want the employees to hear: ""is the sushi any good?"" he siad. ""be honest."" I'm going to tell you what I told him: I'm not a sushi conoisseur by any means, but it tastes fine to me, I've never felt sick from eating it, and since whenever you buy one pack of sushi you get a second one ($6 or less value) free, it's a great deal.",0.0
"Is the Bronx too hood for yelpers?
You're missing out yelpers AND how can you call yourself a yelper if you don't eat outside your comfort zone. PATHETIC!

Anywho, I believe this is Puerto Rican food...I could be wrong. 

I ate pork mofongo. Honestly, when I heard the name I was disgusted (mofongo sounds like something I would nickname my down there when I was mad at it)
Anywho....mofongo...the food was delish. It's plantain, potatoes and pork rinds all mushed together (i think) I could be making all this up so go research it if you're a real foodie. Anywho it was really good. I'm a sucker for potatoes (starch in general) and then the crunch surprise of the thin pork rinds was a nice surprise. I couldn't eat it all, it's a lot...and it's pretty greasy but it's worth the try. 

Fried plantains are my fave. They sell a good sized container of them for about $3, I think. Such a yummy dessert. Again, lots of grease.

Chicken is BOMB. Their spices make my mouth water and the chicken is ever so tender (and greasy, I think you see a pattern here)

Anywho, we got delivery, that was cool.

I went to the restaurant the next day and the set up is kinda like a buffet/cafeteria. They have the setup and you choose what you want and they serve it for you. Nice little seating area. 

It's right by the 4 train, so you don't have to walk too far into the Bronx if you're scared or too good. 

Oh, yeah I drank a ""morir sonando"" ....Which translates into ""dying dreaming""....Kind of morbid if you ask me....but that's how I do (haha morbidly obese that is!) It's O.J and milk....I could swear I was told not to mix those two together when I was little because I would get diarrhea....Well it tasted good and I didn't get diarrhea from it BUT I will warn you, I drank O.J and Milk afterward at home and the end result was not good for me...that may be that I'm also lactose intolerant but I refuse to acknowledge it. Caridad must have the anti diarrhea secret!

I doubt anyone will try this place but I stand behind it! 

Decent prices too. 

P.S if you happen to be from San Diego (fat chance) and are still debating whether to visit this place or not...Imagine a Puerto Rican version of University Ave. SUPER COCINA and that's what you have here.

"Just came back and had an awesome lunch!  To be fair, the place is open for only 2 months and having come from a restaurant background many moons ago, it's almost impossible to get it right when the doors first open.  Consider that when reading some of the bad reviews and don't be afraid to go here.. it was fantastic!

For starters, the service was fantastic.   Ashley was our waitress and she took amazing care of us.  She was fun and she really knew the menu.  

We went for the true tapas experience.  Started with the avocado and heirloom tomato salads.  Both were very simple, fresh and tasty... as they should have been.   Then on to the main tapas.. Shishitos were exactly the way they should be.. piping hot and a gamble of heat... love them..   Grill asparagus was tender as can be and perfectly seasoned.  Octopus was different but in a great way!   Meatballs were pretty good... probably my least favorite but not bad at all.   Grill calamari was light and tender.   Tuna tataki.. pretty basic top quality tuna.. always a favorite.    The star of the tapas was the Fioe Grais .. i get so exited when I see this on a menu and so let down when it comes to the table as a pate... ugh!!  So frustrating.. Ok.. pate is decent but GIVE ME SEARED LIVER... yum!!!  it was outstanding with the potato pancakes and scallops. If you are a lover of this.. must try it!!   let me not forget the stuffed dates wrapped w/ bacon.. kind of a staple these days at any good ""plates"" place!!  

 We finished with the Flan which was second best I have ever had.  I can't give it the best because I have a very good friend (Owen) that makes it just a little better (ok.. it might be equal but he's my buddy).  seriously.. it was amazing!  The chef came over and explained how it was made and how it was passed down through the family.   it is way better than your average flan.   The chocolate moose was pretty sick too.   Very rich and smooth but with little pieces of chocolate throughout to add a little texture that was less familiar but really appreciated.  

Not sure why people are complaining about the Sangria.. although I have not had it my buddy has been there twice and bragged it is the best he has ever had.   The Taperia Old Fashion was just right for me.     Give me a good lunch buzz too!!  :)

let me finish with the was everything came out.   I hate nothing more than when the food just all comes out randomly and all at once.   Either the sever or the kitchen decided how it was all to come out in stages and they nailed it.   They probably sent it out in 4 to 5 stages.   We truly got to appreciate everything we were eating.   I can't stress how important this is.   We didn't instruct them to do it this way.. they just did! 

I recommend going there for lunch for sure and I plan to go back for dinner soon.",0.0
"On a cold, snowy morning, a young woman woke up feeling a little sickies. What more could she want than some of her ima's (mother in hebrew) chicken soup. Since that wasn't possible, because ima is aaaalllll the way in a far away land called New Jersey, Mendy's was the next best option.

"Where do I begin? This place sucks. Thats where.

It was Christmas day, I was sick but when Jack proposed to get out for some food, I figured fresh air and some soup would do me good. 

Basically, everything was closed because of the holiday, except Chinese food, kosher restaurants and unfortunately Joe's Crab Shack. So after much debate between friends, we finally settled on this establishment. We walked in and were seated, the place did not look that busy. The waiter said it would be a 45-50 minute wait for the food. We were cool with that because we figured time was going to pass by quickly while we chatted away.

Our drinks took about 30-40 minutes to make an appearance and an hour later our food was still not ready. Not one appetizer had been placed before us. We were hungry as bears and a slow simmering anger began to boil. 

The waiter told us that they were out of crab. Fine. Then he came out and told us that the food was going to take some more time. Fine. Then after 20 minutes we asked how much longer. We were told that there were a few more plates, otherwise everything was ready. Fine. Half hour later, he came with an apologetic face and said that it says everything is ready on the screen but when he went into the kitchen nothing was ready. WE WERE FURIOUS. We all stood up and just plain left. Never going there again. That one star, was one to many. If I could put a no star rating I would.",0.0
"I love this Bareburger! It's much better than others I've been to (though the others are also great!) and it has a different menu with a gluten free sweet potato burger. This burger is truly delicious; the texture is just right and I could probably eat them every day for a year without getting sick of them.

The only question I have for Bareburger as a brand: why do your different locations have such different menus? I don't love the Bareburger by my house in Forest Hills because the only gluten free vegan burger is the portobello mushroom, which is often slightly overcooked. However, the Forest Hills Bareburger has Daiya cheese and vegan mayo, and the one in the FiDi does not.

So, Bareburger, I'm not sure about these inconsistencies, but please spread this burger around!",0.0
"Feeling home sick from the food I used to eat near my old home, I found this carribbean restaurant on kingsbridge. It seems ok until when I started asking for things, no one seemed to have it together. I ordered a beef Pattie with cheese w/ coco bread, and a roti with stew chicken. The beef Pattie didn't taste like it had cheese, the coco bread was not fresh and hard. The roti... Was hard and seemed like it was heated up in the oven and was crunchy. It's suppose to be soft. It's a island staple bread! The stew chicken which is my fav thing, was dry and was highly influenced by Jamaican pimento flavor and cloves. Not a good flavor in your mouth. Not happy with my 12 dollars spent. Pass....",0.0
"I'm going to give this place five stars. I work in the area and I took a diversion one day. Instead of going left and reaching chipotle on fifth ave, I went straight and my eyes fell on EXK.

I judge a place based on its soups. I'm sick and tired of Pret a manger and their moroccan lentil soup. It was delicious at first but lately, I can feel the aroma of the soup more than the taste of the fcuking lentils. Anyone knows that specific taste lentils leave on your buds, it's subtle and muted. EXK fits that bill. I have been here 3 times so far and will make grace this place with my presence going forward. I love the soups - all of them, chiefly the lentil soups.

The lounge looks great. But I do not have the time to sit around there. But I'm gonna have to bring my wife one of these days.

The carrot salad - class act - carrot strings and have a touch of ginger. The pastries look nice but I'm on muffin control mode.",0.0
"I was feeling a bit under the weather so I decided to stop by to get some ash reshteh to take out for dinner.

He gave me small sample servings of the fesenjan, the gheimeh, zereshk polo with chicken as well as the ash. The ash here is on point! I bought the large, thinking I would split it into two meals, but ended up eating the whole thing. It's that good.

"First I would like to thank this cafe in the middle of Chinatown. Definitely should go if you got sick of Chinese food. Go during lunch hours, there may be specials. Although pricey the setting of the place is gorgeous.",0.0
"Has gone downhill over the years in my opinion, while prices have gone up compared to their local competitors.  Their selection of non-Chinese products like Thai stuff has declined.  They do have a larger selection of American canned and jarred foods than New York Mart which is probably useful for locals, since that stuff is pretty scarce in those parts.

On my last trip about a month ago, I noticed a LOT of canned and jarred products very close to, or past, their sell-by dates.  I'm not afraid of getting sick from that stuff (one rarely does from even very old cans or jars), but nor do I want to buy, let alone pay a little extra for, product that's been sitting on a shelf there or in a warehouse for the past 2-3 years...

And yes, everything in Chinatown is generally fresher toward the end of the week and on weekends, but the noodle/tofu/dairy cases can look extra sad here earlier in the week.

Their meat and seafood selection is smaller than dedicated seafood or butcher/meat stores in the neighborhood, so I've never seen any reason to patronize those sections rather than the other places which, have higher turnover to boot.",0.0
"I live a couple of blocks away from here and I come every week. My mom who's obsessed always gets the chocolate chip walnut cookie. It is obviously the best selling item from here and thanks to the high turnover they always have a fresh batch out of the oven. I personally love peanut butter so I always get the dark chocolate peanut butter cookie but I really hope they have one made with regular cookie batter instead of dark chocolate because by the end of the cookie I would be so sick of the rich cacao flavor. I don't actually like the scones here because I for one don't like raisins but I also think the texture is too crumbly.

"What they got right: the décor, the music, the service, the cocktails are to die for and the appetizers were amazing especially the anchovies, the cecina with shrimp which was TO DIE FOR, the crudité which was beautiful and fresh, and the wine list was great.

What they didn't get right: my waiter was very nice but he was not well educated about the ingredients. I tasted cheese in the pesto and he said there was no cheese. I'm lactose intolerant and woke up sick today. For sure, there was cheese and enough for the flavor to be obvious. I also ordered a bottle of wine which he asked me about 4 times because he didn't know the wine menu well. The spaghetti with crab was WAY overcooked. The noodles were practically limp. The lobster catalan which the waiter said was one of the best entrees was just ok.

Overall: would I go back, yes because of the cocktails and the appetizers. I'll try another pasta and entrée next time.",0.0

"This is a review on Cooler Cleanse from Juice Generation. I decided to do a 3-day juice cleanse with my friend. We both had no experience with juice cleansing, but thought we would give it a try. We were trying to obtain that ""energetic"" ""detoxed"" feeling that everyone speaks about!

Well, we both hated the juices. They were in no way filling and extremely sweet or extremely sour (spicy lemonade). In no way did we feel satisfied, tired, energetic, or ""cleansed."" We both felt sick, hungry, and irritated at the cost of this 3-day cleanse ($170) and the ripped-off feeling we had. Both of us felt sick and ended the cleanse a day early. Juice generation cooler cleanse called to ask how I was feeling. I told her I was sick, really did not enjoy it, and didn't feel well, (even today a few days later I'm still not functioning normally!) all she said was ""let me know if you have any other questions or comments.""

It was a chicken breast with fries with parm not too hard to mess up. Finally I ordered the yogurt cake for dessert. The cherry syrup was entirely too sweet.

"Whoever wrote great reviews for this place on Seamless must have been paid, and I'm kicking myself for not checking Yelp as well (won't be making that mistake again). Like others below, the seamless reviews tricked me into ordering from here instead of the usual sushi spot around the block that I know is safe and tasty (you never really appreciate how great you have it until you stray away). The food arrived pretty quickly, but that was the end of anything positive.

The ginger salad, which I usually love, went straight into the trash. The dressing was pale yellow. I have never in my life seen pale yellow ginger dressing. It had a very strong lemon taste and was watery looking. I became concerned and dumped it. 

The salmon and avocado sushi roll tasted strongly and suspiciously of lemon.  As far as I know, lemon is usually used to mask unpleasant tastes, like, say, rotten fish hmmm. But being hungry, frugal, and foolish I ate the roll instead of ordering a different lunch. Foolishly, I also ate the shrimp shumai that was mostly tasteless, but on one of them I could see the ""guts"" of a shrimp. 

Now I'm sitting here mad at myself, and terrified that in three hours I'll violently ill. Avoid this place, unless you like the anxiety of wondering whether you have food poisoning.",0.0
"I should have heeded the other negative reviews, but I was too enticed by the $3.95 all you can drink bloody marys, and for that I was punished with RAW EGGS.

I ordered Uova Al Forno (eggs baked with tomato sauce and oregano). It arrived barely warmer than room temperature, but I decided sending it back would have taken forever... big mistake. About halfway through, I got a big mouthful of RAW egg white which I had to spit out into my napkin. 24 hours later, I still can't get the feeling of it out of my mouth, but luckily at least I'm not violently sick from salmonella. The triangle shaped latke it came with was also cold, greasy, and completely tasteless.

To top it off, something was floating in my friend's water glass, and it took a long time to flag someone down to ask for a change of water, and a refill on mine. The bloody marys were ok, but so full of horseradish that it was kind of gross after a while. The refills also arrive warm (they pour from a room temperature carafe) and it was next to impossible to get the waitress' attention to ask for ice. I should note that the woman refilling our drinks was lovely and very sweet. The other waitress was totally aloof until it was time for us to pay. The bill was on the table 2 seconds after they picked up our plates, without even asking if we needed anything else or how the food was (I never got a chance to tell anyone about my raw plate of gross-ness).

"I remember a time when I stopped liking Xi'an food, and I was not sure why. It was either I thought the proportions were small or that it was not delicious enough. Some thing might have been wrong with me back then, because I am addicted to it now. 

I always order N1, the spicy lamb noodles and it is always so delicious. I come to conclusion that I love my noodles to be thick rather than thin squiggly lines and that is exactly what Xi'an Famous Food provides. I love the amount of spice they add into, it is not too spicy and it is definitely not bland. 

On a really hungry day, I would add a beef bun as an appetizer, $3 and it is amazing. In addition, they have a bunch of cheap drinks in the fridge such as soy milk or tea, which is a great add if you cannot handle your spicyness.

Great landmark building. This could be a great establishment but they lack sanitary wise. I don't even want to know or imagine how the kitchen looks like. 

I went in there with a Groupon for 4 four course pre fix menu. We ordered the prime rib and the red snapper filet. Every food item given was really good and well seasoned. Three stars because of the food and decor. 

My friends and I enjoyed ourselves, but I also have to mentioned that we did come out with a little backache from hovering too much since we're eating on top of  coffee table basically.",0.0
"I come here often enough to warrant far more than a 3-star review but there is something slightly uncomfortable about awarding four precious yelp stars to a place that is (1) grungy enough to make you cringe when you walk in, (2) greasy enough to make you want to take a postprandial nap at the chipped linoleum table, (3) basic enough to find almost anywhere else, and (4) a place that would never, ever cross a foodie's list of 'must-go-to's. 

Still, sometimes, grungy, greasy, basic, and non-foodie is exactly all you need. 

Bare confession: Kan Wah is on my speed dial, right alongside my man, my family, and 911. For nearly a decade, this Chinese takeout fare has been my proverbial tub of ice cream during every messy heartbreak, the indulgence that broke multiple diets, and the easy fix for every night I didn't feel like cooking. The portions are great, the prices have seen very little upward movement, and they've added a new combination plate menu that gets you popular entree + fried rice + egg roll for no more than $8. I'm also quite fond of their vegetable chow fun, which is devoid of the usual garbage fillers (water chestnuts, I'm looking at you here) and General Tso's tofu, which hits all the right spicy notes. Broccoli with garlic sauce is a little on the sweeter side than other places, but also a dependable go-to. My family is also a big fan of their beef and broccoli, sesame chicken, and shrimp with garlic sauce. Order enough and you get certain freebies like free drinks (or, as we recently scored during our last $30+ delivery order, a free entree). No one's ever gotten sick, food poisoning, or found strange things in their food and the only negative aftereffect we've ever had to deal with is the poundage gained from scarfing down all that takeout. 

Dining in is a risky and sometimes uncomfortable affair. During the colder months, the heat isn't on, and it's usually too hot to dine in during the summer because the a/c seems to be just for decoration (might be how they keep the food costs down), but there are three old booths there if you need a place to nosh. When we place orders for delivery, the guys usually makes it to our door within the half hour (and they've come to our doorstep so often that they hardly need to ring the doorbell) with all the politeness and cheerfulness you'd want but wouldn't expect.",0.0
The most terrible experience from all seven eleven stores they sold me ice cream that were melted and frozen again in which result u get a separate ice cream.

Great experience! Beautifully mastered sushi like a beautiful art   The chefs here are beyond amazing. Everyone who works here is great never missing a beat with anything you need.  The food was out of this world. Although it is a lot to have so many dishes they are all unique in there own way. The upgrade for the wagyu beef is very worth it could have ate 10 of them. Was an unforgettable experience and worth the price for a once in a while treat. The one thing that really amazed me about this restaurant is its toro because everywhere else I've ever had it (other high end places such as nobu and morimoto) has made me sick but not here it is so fresh it's mind blowing. This will be the only place I ever eat toro again. Thank you everyone who works here for the unforgettable and great experience. One tip sit at the bar the table is extraordinary,0.0
"My fiance and I went to Pappardella because she was craving pasta and is gluten free. Our visit went really well, but was marred by a miscommunication in the kitchen which resulted in my fiance eating some regular bread and getting very sick. The owner responded ASAP by apologizing, comping our meal, and asking that we give them another chance. 

Our second visit was excellent and no mishaps. The food at Pappardella is excellent, homemade, slightly inventive, and the experience is quite nice. 

Despite a traumatic first visit, we will surely be visiting them again.",0.0

"This is one of our favorite places to just stop buy if we don't have other dinner plans on a Saturday night. The staff is great and always really friendly and the menu is great.

We normally just order a bunch of appetizers and tomato soup and of course a bottle of wine or a couple of drinks. This is one of the only places were I really enjoy ordering drinks! But lately no matter what I order I am disappointed. I might just have grown tired of the menu because I am here a lot, or they are doing sometime different. 

They still get four stars from be because I still recommend it to all my friends. So if you are looking for a laid back place to share something small and have some drinks this is definitely the place....

"I always get congee here before heading home. The thousand year old egg (which is actually just fermented egg) and roast pork congee is only $4, and it's probably the best thing you could ever feed your body when you're sick.

But I still stand firm on the congees. Ask for extra scallions/green onions. 

ALSO. I love this restaurant because I left my iPhone here at 10AM once, did not know where it was for the longest time, and when I finally realized that I lost it, I called it at 10 PM, and they picked up and told me that I left my phone at the restaurant. When I went, the worker there had tried calling my mom so that he could return the phone. SUCH SWEET PEOPLE HERE. I really love their friendly service and their integrity.

Disgusting. I ordered their chicken and veggies soup for delivery... I'm less than 2 blocks away but I was sick and couldn't pick up. The soup came within 20 min but was barely lukewarm...

"I've been coming here since after 3 weeks of their opening. I love the atmosphere/ambiance. It's is a nice, sun-lit, light and airy open space with enough seating not only at tables but at the counter/bar area. 

The staff:  Handsome and SUPER friendly. My favorite is Collin. He's always right on top of everything, jovial and knows all his customers pretty much by name. The rest of the dudes working here are also friendly and pretty good looking as well.

The crowd: Mostly hot girls on their laptops or meeting for afternoon coffee tea and the occasional dude sandwiched in their somewhere.

I love that the door leading to the barber shop in the back is open so you can see what's going on as it creates a lot of activity/energy to a place where most people have ear buds plugged into their heads.

At 5pm the coffee shop turns into a bar and (my only complaint) you have to shut down your laptops. GRRRRR.....   LET'S COMPROMISE!  8PM?

All in all, I wish I lived closer but, I'm still willing to walk the 8 blocks just to come sit here (fuck Variety and their tight spaces and over-hipsterized atmosphere where everyone is looking over your shoulder at what your doing).

"Extremely hyped $15 ramen....$17 if you decide to add an egg. 
No matter how good ramen is, it is not worth $15 lol
This place was just okay. The broth is a lot better than any other ramen places I have been to in America, but cannot be compared to the ramen places in Japan. 

I ordered the spicy ramen and found it a little too salty. I couldn't drink more than 25% of the soup without feeling sick. 

5-stars for the pork belly buns. Those were delicious!

"**This review is for the vegetable ramen only**

The vegetables were extremely fresh. Some looked slightly cooked (not the spinach) but they all still had their crunch and tasted great. They came in a very sturdy bowl on top of the noodles.

This place has gotten a lot of negative votes on their ramen for tastelessness. This is my first time ordering ramen, but I order soups pretty frequently especially when sick or hungover. This is one of my favorites I've ever ordered. The vegetable broth is delicate, but it is very very flavorful. It tastes significantly more homemade/less processed/less chemical-y than most soups I've ordered.

"Meh. Very disappointing experience. I had this place bookmarked for a while, and when I found myself downtown yesterday, I decided to give it a go. Between my bf and I we ordered 4 things: 

1. Fried Calamari- This was decent. The marinara was too sweet for my taste, but it was okay. Nothing special. Beware that their calamari only comes in rings- none of those tiny and wonderful little legs. 

2. Butternut Squash Soup- This was one of their specials, and probably the best thing we had all night. It was a little bit sweet, but still very delicious. As a twist, they added in swiss cheese which turned out to be a delicious pairing. 

3. Ravioli Pellegrino- This was my bf's entree. It was pretty disgusting. The ravioli may be alright, but the sauce tasted like melted butter. If you can imagine a giant stick of butter melted in a pan with a touch of cream, this was probably it. My bf took a bite and sat back because it was basically inedible. 

4. Pappardelle- Another special of the night. It was made with ground beef and a cognac cream sauce. This was the most disappointing dish of the night. When the waiter first brought out the plate, it looked like dog food. I was immediately turned off. Essentially, I was staring at a giant plate of pasta with chunks of ground beef. And I mean random, chopped up chunks. I lost my appetite just looking at it. The pasta was fresh, but undercooked. And the mushroom cognac sauce was meh. Definitely nothing special. 

The best part? Our check came out to $75.99 without tip. A hefty price to pay for a not so stellar meal. 

Maybe I came on a bad night. Maybe their usual cooks were sick. Maybe my dishes were a fluke, or maybe this place is just too hyped up to be real.",0.0

It even has a sick hairdo. Now when you do finally open a pineapple, you'll find that it is sweet as fuk, but its also acidic, you can't just eat a pineapple like you can an apple, it will fuk your mouth up and wreak havoc on your enamel. Plus, you can't put apples on a pizza, that's groce, but hawaain pizza is one of the most popular dishes around. What other fruit is commonly found on pizza bitch?

"This place is gorgeous and has good coffee and a poppin' location. So why isn't it completely packed 24/7?  Well, unfortunately, I discovered for myself (3x no less, in the case that I caught them on an off hour). The short of it, like the other reviews say:

- Service is sloowww--wwwww-www (but very sweet)

-Layout is craaa--aaayyyy

- For me, the kicker was that the drinks are WAY too sweet. When I saw that this place served acai bowls and juices I was thrilled - i'm a big green juice person, and like a purist - I like that ish GREEN with a splash of lemon for sweetness and maybe one slice of apple.  Any actual juice place does this pretty well.  I have an insulin condition and need to be really careful about sugar- I don't even drink any orange juice or diet soda. Unfortunately the green juice I got was probably 90% apple and 9% celery and 1% spinach.  Couldn't even finish it and 2 hours later still feel sick. $7 out the window for feeling like I'm about to tip into diabetic shock.

The thing is, people who do green juice are expecting something specific - if they wanted apple juice or orange juice or something sweet, they would have ordered it! 

Unfortunately it seems like a general issue with all of their drinks because they have generous sample bins with yummy sounding drinks and everything had 10x the sugar that it should - all their lemonades, etc. If you have a serious sweet tooth I guess this would  be a good spot for you.",0.0
"Although the concepts seem great, they are not executed well and just present blah food. First the sangria- it is so sweet, it tastes like that bottled sangria you get for $5 from trader joes. Don't waste the money. Second we order $1 ousters which we were told were blue point. Great! We love blue point, always reliable, however, these blue point must've been from last year because they were not edible! I try oxtail croquettes .. Dry, blah taste. To top it off, I get the beer salad because  that can't be screwed up, but the beets tasted as if they were not ripe, if that is possible, I guess just not properly cooked. So even though I did not get sick and the decor and concept is great, it is not worth wasting your money on the food, maybe just happy hour wine.",0.0

"The worst! I ordered through GrubHub. I ordered a fillet of catfish and a shrimp dinner with macaroni cheese and fries with a lemonade. Everything tasted horrible. It all tasted off. Leaving a funny nasty aftertaste in my mouth.
Food arrived about an hour after I ordered. The fries cold old like the fried than yesterday. The the fish which I don't think was catfish was overly salted and have way too much seasoning to even be edible. The lemonade tasted like a sick sweet syrupy Kool Aid. The shrimp we're Calabasas from there okay . The macaroni and cheese was a big square brick it was okay but tasted of mustard. 

I have ate here before but I have picked it up myself and it was over four months ago.I ordered a fish sandwich with fries they have since changed the fries. The fish sandwich was very good.

"Don't order anything from this ""restaurant"".
I am pretty irritated as I write this, having just got off the phone with whom I assume is the owner. I wanted to give this place a try since it first appeared on GrubHub, but I wasn't able to since they weren't delivering to my area. After having an order get canceled today, I decided to see if they finally expanded their area and to my surprise they had. I ordered myself a spinach calzone and a grilled chicken panini, which according to GH is made with tomato, basil, olive oil, grilled chicken and mozzarella. Sounds pretty good, right? Too bad in reality it's actually caesar dressing and chicken with wilted lettuce put in hero bread that's been through a panini press. Oops. I opened my sandwich expecting to see what's advertised and was VERY disappointed, seeing as how if I wanted grilled chicken caesar I'd have ordered it, you know? I call the restaurant and begin to explain my problem. He gives me a million stereotypical bad customer service quotes such as :

""What do you want me to do about it?"" 
""You should call Grub Hub about that""
""There's nothing I can do about it now""
""The guy in the kitchen did that""

I wish I was joking. I have so many issues with the conversation I just had with him.
You have employees who don't know your menu, so that tells me mistakes happen frequently and since food allergies are common, who knows who has gotten sick from ""mistakes"" by the ""guy in the kitchen"". If I was vegan and ordered a salad that had meat in it, I'd be furious. This place isn't worth your time or money.",0.0
"Not for real ramen lovers.

Maybe The expectations of this place was set too high being it is a Korean noodle shop. But people recommended this place for the delicious ramen and ...this place shouldn't ever be brought up in any kind of ramen conversation. 

We ordered a mokbar classic, sweet potato chips, and the pork dumplings.

The sweet potato chips were the best thing that we ordered, and that says a lot. The dumplings were pretty good too, but the dipping sauce had a weird fishy after taste.

Now onto the ramen. I have never had a bowl of ramen that tasted like it had a splash of the Atlantic Ocean mixed in it. What exactly do they put in there ??!!?? I've had my share of fishy and I eat a lot of fishy things but ramen is something that should not taste that way. Maybe they use some kind of fish bone stock? Whatever it is, it is a mistake.

1. papaya salad, not bad at ALL. the beef that came on top was seasoned very well, i would def come back just for that. 

2. the Pho. the beef pho as the other yelpers said it was super mediocre. it tasted like Pho flavored soup rather than actual pho.  It tasts like the package cup noodle. The broth should be everything in the beef pho but it just tasted a bit bland and it was o k. would i order it if i was desperate and sick and cannot go out to get food yes. other than that i would never have it here again.  You know its not super good pho when you have to ""dress it up yourself"" with the hoisin and hot sauce, when u take a sip without sauces it should hit the spot, and this one didnt.

Spring rolls. Summer rolls. Grilled pork. Noodles. Things I know that are standard pho things to order.

Spring rolls are always a good idea. Crispy and flavorful, paired with the fish sauce (which isn't as strong as other pho places I know), I always have to have it as an appetizer or part of my main dish. My go to entree is the spring roll + grilled pork with lettuce in vermicelli, drenched in fish sauce. I'm in love.

"Be aware of mold, especially in the produce department. I was talking to the store manager repeatedly between December and April, showed him moldy fruit baskets, rotten tomatoes and pears, dried out and bad smelling oranges and clementines etc. one time after the other only to come back after a week and discover more of the same: it is disgusting. I was not the only one: either other customers were chiming in or I became a witness of others complaining.
 
Additional problems, like overpriced organic food (bread, milk yogurt etc) and the odd habit to stock shelves during high business hours when customers and staff compete for the narrow isle space, are minor, considering the fact that the produce you will buy here is often simply bad and will potentially make you sick. This store is a scandal competing with Fine Fair a few blocks South and the infamous Inwood Postal Office for the worst customer service in the city. The NYS Department of Agriculture should close this store down. Hopefully it would re-open under better management.

"I really wish there were half stars on this because I'd give this place 3.5 stars. Anyway, where to beginnnn...

My friend and I were originally going to another restaurant nearby but didn't have the heart to wait like an hour and thirty to get seated. She spotted this place because of all the Christmas lights and a lightbulb went off in her head -- she heard this place was an amazing experience, so I said why not! At the time, there weren't a lot of people loitering outside, so we walked down the street to this bodega to pick up some beers to share as it's BYOB. Got back and there was a HUGE gathering outside with people on each step of the narrow staircase but luckily one of the guys spotted us and noticed it was just the two of us (we can make it if we try... -- sorry had to) and we squeezed up the tight stairway and was transported into this crazy lighted space. 

Warning. This place is SMALL. like REALLY REALLY SMALL. If you've ever ridden on a yellow school bus when you were primary/secondary school, this space is exactly like the inside of a school bus on steroids. I mean, close quarters and low ceilings, enhanced by the fact that the amazing lights are hung incredibly low. I'm 5'1"" and I felt a few lights on the top of my head.

This place can get incredibly loud, especially when you've got like 4 birthday parties within one meal time session. And each time they play this awesome (for the first couple of times) birthday song with the strobe light effects, but it gets old after about the 4th time. I'm certain the workers are all sick of it by now, haha. 

We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chana shag (chickpea and spinach) and both dishes were okay. They weren't anything to write home about -- and I have really high standards for Indian dishes ever since I got a taste of real home cooking -- but they were good decent plates, and I had been craving Indian food so it probably tasted even better than it actually was but I digress. Food came out hot and yummy. The naan wasn't bad either, but I've had better vegetable samosas. I think it was just like potato and curry in it and nothing else. The mango ice cream was yummy too. Just a hint of mango and made for a nice ""palate cleanser"" I guess, and it was free, soooo that makes it even better. 

Another thing that we didn't know about, it's a cash only place. So remember to bring cash!

So I give it 3.5 stars for the atmosphere -- the fact that people around us all seemed like they were having an amazing time (probably all the hard liquor we saw at some tables), the trippyness, and the food was okay. It's really something to experience. My friend is already musing about having her birthday dinner here just for the lights and the BYOB.",0.0
"Good food and service... up until they told us to basically leave our table because a) we had been there for too long; b) we didn't have a reservation when we got our table and c) someone with a reservation had been waiting too long.

We took advantage of the brunch special... and since I wanted to get the lobster mac and cheese but not as my entree, I asked if I could get it as an extra starter.... only they brought out the entree version instead. And charged me the entree version as well. Annoying.

My actual entree, the poco benedict was pretty good - nothing to write home about though. I wish that the arepa was a better substitute for the traditional english muffin or toast - but it was just too wet and fell apart when I was trying to eat it. I also found the lobster mac and cheese to be too rich. It was great for the first few bites... then I was so sick of it and the smell was just seriously overwhelming. It's nice that our server brought me back the leftovers... but I ended up giving them to the first homeless guy I saw anyway. S ordered ""The Cure"" which looked amazing... but they gave her chicken the first time around even though she didn't order any. At least her correct entree came out quite quickly. However, she did say it was just alright - nothing to really write home about and as a Latina, she definitely was not impressed.

I guess the highlight of the meal was the sangria - she had the red and I had the white. The white was great and the server did make sure that my glass was always full... I wish I could say the same about my friend - we had to flag down the various servers bustling about quite often to get her a refill which was slightly annoying.

I understand that there was a party going on and that brunch was busy... but that's really no reason for blah service. I think I'd only come back as a last resort for a boozy brunch - there are other better places. Even other better cash only places - so I don't really need to come back unless I have to.

Rice is perfect for getting your chopstick on.",0.0
Went here in a last minute crunch for a quick meal. The place had just opened and their was already a fair number of people dining. The black bean and sweet potato burrito entree was very good- although the sweet potatoes were pureed and seemed to come from a can. The side salad and seasoned rice were good. The fish in the fish tacos was not fresh. I was disappointed with this appetizer.  The frozen margarita was pretty good. Don't know if I would return here after reading about the food poisoning and my own experience with the poor fish tacos.,0.0
"One of my favorite bars in the Lower East Side, and I mean LOWER Lower East Side. 

I grew up around the area, just two blocks away, and I remember when it was just a local dive bar. Now it's got a New Orleans theme, even more divy-er, and the bathrooms are disgusting, but oh well, what bathrooms are clean in dive bars? 

I've had the dumplings once, it was just okay, I don't come to a dive bar for dumplings though, you can go across to Lam Zhou for the best dumplings in the city. 

I come here for super cheap ass drink specials, like $3 for a beer and shot during happy hour, and it's only goes up to $5 when it's not happy hour. There actually is a selection of cheap beer, like Miller High Life and PBR, and a selection of well liquor like whiskey, tequila and etc. There's also a selection of cider and good selection of drafts as well. 

I love the vibe and energy in the bar, even though 99% of the crowd isn't from NYC, I always have a good cheap time whenever I'm in the area. 

I'm hesitant to try the other foods, such as the raw oyster bar, cause the place looks kinda filthy, but then again, I've been eating in Chinatown all my life, so maybe I have a iron stomach by now. I'll update if I get food poisoning.",0.0
"The chicken basically came running out of the kitchen still alive and onto our plates. 

Since it was about 9:30 at night and the lighting is dim (on the roof top), we could not see we were about to eat RAW CHICKEN. It was probably the most DISGUSTING thing I have ever bitten into. 

The waitress was kind and offered us a free drink (SURE that will compensate for the potential salmonella poisoning). They threw the kabobs back on the grill and returned the food to us- PRETTY MOUTHWATERING, RIGHT? We were charged for the succulent food.

We told the owner/manager about the experience and he could not of cared any less, he offered us an insincere apology. We headed outside and the valet guy, I mean mario andretti, recklessly brought us our car.

On the upside, the rooftops area is pretty.",0.0
"Jack, thanks for your kind message. I apologize, I thought I had updated my review earlier, but it failed to save.

Clearly my sickness was not Hendrik's responsibility at all and I'm sorry for the negative review.",0.0
"After being in admitted to the Beth Israel Medical center, I've been looking forward to being able to eat my first real meal, rather than the slop served in the cafeteria here. 

My meal tonight was literally white bread, pasta, and rice. Forgoing this alien experiment in bland starches, I sent my friends (who've come to understand their place as my servants while I'm sick) to get Ramen. Afterall, what could be more soothing and delicious than a hot bowl of ramen after days of bloody diahreah? Not much. And with my level of starvation for malleable food, quite frankly, cup of noodles sounds nearly appetizing. Almost anything would satisfy this open door hunger. 

After waiting an hour, they finally arrived, goods in hand. The moment was here. A large plastic container of Vegetable Miso Ramen was set in front of me; with all it's steaming splender. My friends and I popped the top off our containers and a barrage of smells; reminiscent of the hospital we were already in, filled the room. Not ideal.

I'll end here, though, by saying, currently, the bioharzard trash can is filled with all three our Kambis ramen as well as the needles that stuck my arm- the ladder causing me slightly less pain.

To the owners / managers of Kambi, should you read this, please contact me- as I would like refunded the cost of this food, but don't have the heart to send my friends back in the cold night to deliver it back tonight.

Thank you.",0.0
"Wow, not a good experience. I ordered via seamless, so this review is strictly for the food. The only reason I'm giving any stars is they delivered within 15 minutes, I didn't get food poisoning, and the curry was salvageable. I've been to Thailand so I know what real Thai food tastes like, but I don't expect that when I order Thai from seamless in the states...this restaurant fell below any expectations of good Thai food, Americanized or otherwise. I ordered shrimp spring rolls and green curry. The shrimp rolls had no shrimp in them...and I don't mean a small amount of shrimp...I mean zero shrimp. The roll itself was crunchy and stale. The curry tasted so off and bitter until I realized it was because it had no coconut milk or sugar! I don't like things overly sweet but green curry MUST have coconut milk and a dash of sugar or the flavors don't blend and to put more plainly...it's just not green curry. I remedied this by adding coconut milk and a dash of sugar and voila! Suddenly edible. But honestly I'm shocked this place has good reviews.",0.0
"Not too long ago, my beloved Flushing Noodle Shop closed down and I didn't know where else to go. I was lost, I was sad, and I was empty--of noodle soup. Afterall, Flushing is dominated by a sea of exotic, northern Chinese cuisines and this was my staple Hong Kong-style Flushing noodle shop that was the closest thing to what every corner in Chinatown has.

It's a little bit of unfortunate experiences at other noodle shops for me to finally end up here--from catching a fly in my noodle soup and getting food poisoning from Noodle Village, to MSG-loaded at Corner 28--I'd say it has been quite the journey just to get my wonton noodle soup fix. Sifu Chio is in the unlikely area of downtown Flushing, where people don't immediately flock to for food--it is right on the dead end of 40th Road & Prince Street, and it can easily be overlooked. 

I love their Shrimp Wonton Noodles, which is a really cheap and filling meal for a mere $5.25. The pork in the wontons are not heavy and they are really addictive--I honestly get to all the wontons before I even pick up a piece of noodle! I always get mine to go and it's an additional 25 cents if you want to separate the soup and noodles. The people here are friendly and it's one of the very few places in Flushing where the staff speaks Cantonese. This place is always kind of dead for some reason--I think that's why their food is so good, because it's still a hidden gem.",0.0
"Came in on a Friday and it was crowded. I waited for a while and the seated me at the front table where they put the take out food. That was fine except that they told me they would give half off my meal- which they didn't, and the waitress kept slamming down menus on the table with no regard to my comfort while patronizing. I live in the neighborhood and was willing to give them a pass. Until the next day when i went to eat my leftover chicken vindaloo and bit into a huge bug that resembles a roach. I will never eat there again and would not recommend it. I get sick to my stomach each time i think of it!",0.0

Bad - In the 10 or so times I've order from here, one time there was a green caterpillar in the steamed vegetables (dead) and another time there was what looked like a thin wood splinter, about 2 inches long in the lo mein, or maybe a bristle. 

It actually seems pretty clean in there for a Chinese takeout place, I've seen them scrubbing the cook surfaces down with soap and steel wool, and they have an A grade (http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchDetails.do) with 7 points, which is very low, whereas M Noodle got 63 last inspection, which is like a C grade, but it looks cleaner on the outside so you might not realize it.

"I won't lie, we probably would not have known about Don Peppe Vesuvio if it weren't for another crew. Vince, Drama, E and Turtle. Yes..HBO 30-minute comedy show runner brought us to this New York staple. 

First off, it's in the middle of Ozone Park which was formerly an Italian neighborhood like much of Queens. No reservations and no plastic accepted. You have to love the drab appearance of it inside, it's like a restaurant set from a soap opera. If you've been here, you know what I'm talking about. Don't bother asking for a menu, it's on the wall and it looks like it could also be used interchangeable to tell you who won bingo night too.

While this may not be my favorite Italian I've ever eaten, it's certainly up there. The waiters here are old school no-nonsense standup guys. My first time dining here I was told, ""No alfredo or vodka sauce, guy"". Gotta love it.

Baked clams is a must and I will say that that is the best I will ever have. I'm all for ""one shots"" but these babies are HOT. The bread crumbs are so light and the juice/sauce is just fantastic. Now the rule for everyone is to use the bread to mop that good stuff up. I'm a sick puppy, I take spoonfuls. Yes, spoonfuls!

We typically get two pastas when we go there. Linguini with white clam sauce and the spaghetti with shrimp sauce. The linguini is done very well, lots of garlic as is appropriate and cooked flawlessly. Great clam flavor. The spaghetti with shrimp sauce may actually be in my top five pastas. A simple pomodoro sauce with red pepper and shrimp. This is how good pasta should taste though, simple good old home cooking. 

Prepare yourself for the veal don peppe. Fred Flintstone style veal cutlets topped with a catering size portion of bruschetta. This veal is so tender that they serve it to you with spoons! If that's not comfort food, I don't know what is. 

Aside from the food, it really is a fun experience between the characters you see in here and all the history if you ask around. While this may not be the same Vesuvio from The Sopranos, it's not far off.

The entree was very greasy even though i asked for them to go light on the oil. I am saddened that I had to write this review but after the last couple of times being disappointed and giving them more chances with the take out I have had enough.

"i live around the area for a year now and finally decided to step in and give it a shot.  (don't normally go into restaurant when they intentionally covered up all windows with random stuffs. )
The service was very average, the food took 45 min to come and the quality of the sashimi were low, this is the most important part that bothers me.  It is the worst to consume raw meat/fish when they are not near fresh.  you can get really sick, the two of us left with many leftover that should not be eaten. 
i would not recommend this place to anyone.",0.0
"My mom came home with a chicken buss up roti and we shared it. As I was devouring a piece of my chicken, I noticed it was a little pink on the inside. Something told me to open the entire piece of chicken and the whole thing was pink on the inside. I'm PISSED!! At the fact that Bake and Things did not check to see if their food was cooked entirely. Now if I get sick from this, I will be calling the department of health on them. The only reason why it got 1 star is because the buss up was good and I love their passion fruit juice. I will not be eating from there again.",0.0

"Pickles and portions are amazing. The brines are salty, sour, and distinctively spicy, ranging from hot pepper to cinnamon and clove. We ordered the $16 flight of 8, thinking we would receive a few spears or pieces of each, but every variety completely filled a $2 jam jar, I would estimate .25lbs (for a total of 2lbs of pickles!) We also ordered the mushroom mac and cheese, which was bad and came in a humongous cast iron skillet, drenched in relatively flavorless sauce, topped with a paltry smattering of mushrooms (none mixed in), and the edges and top could have been way crispier. The ratio was so off, that the first few bites were okay, but the majority of the meal was just overly rich overcooked penne, which left us sick. They have 2 types of root beer on tap, so we got floats for dessert, which were good and came with a jar of extra root beer to replenish the vanilla ice cream. The service was atrocious: immature, incompetent hostess and aloof, slow waiter. Overall an okay experience, but I won't be back.",0.0

"This place!!
I've been getting sick of the sushi places in Murray Hill and am usually too lazy to travel elsewhere to get sushi, but last weekend, the boy and I decided to travel a little further uptown and try Matsu.

I gotta say, it wasn't just the rave reviews on here that made my decision to try it. It was the photo of the toilet seat. I just had to see it for myself. This is how immature I am. Also, someone's picture of the Spicy Tuna Salsa roll basically sold it.

Regardless! This place is awesome. Pretty cozy, not a huge amount of seating.. I'd say maybe 20 tables tops. We went around 8 pm on a Saturday, thinking it was going to be packed like the other sushi places by us, but it wasn't, thankfully. There were a good amount of full tables when we got there but nothing crazy. We were sat immediately and also helped immediately, which was awesome. 

We ordered edamame and some wine and I ordered the Spicy Tuna Salsa roll (spicy tuna, mango, peanuts,...possibly avocado?, wrapped in rice and seaweed and then fried in tempura topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce...holy YUM). I also got a crunchy spicy salmon roll. There were only 6 pieces to the hand roll, which was a little disappointing because I feel like usually there's 8, but I ate enough edamame to make up for it. 

The service was great. It took a little longer to make the rolls that I thought it would but it was nice to just sit and relax and enjoy the company without feeling like we were being rushed out of the restaurant. The ambience was nice, too. Not too bright, not too dark. I'll definitely be coming back here again, it was awesome.

And you gotta see that toilet seat.",0.0
"Staff were excellent however I was served under cooked fish, chicken and greasy rice. Send dish back. Pretty much same dish came back out. Ordered a breadstick.

"Well, all is NOT WELL here at this McDonald's though it's not that the food has made me sick but the management has.

I've been enjoying a ""two-fer"" here; you take your receipt home, go to a McDonald's website, answer a few questions and at the end you get a code number to put on your receipt for your next visit.

Well, the young miss prowling the front of the house where the registers are denied me my two-fer, which in my case was two DOUBLE Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, something I've already had like six or seven times before.

She also said that the number I'd put on my receipt from the McDonald's website was invalid.

The offer says that I can have any two LARGE McD sandwiches as part of the offer and what isn't larger than a double Filet-o-fish sandwich?

Indeed, the cash registers already have this sandwich pre-programmed as a specific cash register key.",0.0
"This is one of my favorite places to eat still, might even be in my top 10 personally. It is nice (renovated) and spacious. They serve banging food at very affordable prices. IMO, this is one of the best birthday places; good food where everyone can afford it. I have been eating here since they were across the street where Amaru is now. Try eating here on the weekend without hearing at least five birthdays. 

FYI: They do accept credit cards now, they started about a year ago. Previously it was AMEX/cash only. They take Mastercard/Visa too now.

For appetizers, the menu varies from place to place. For here, I prefer the ceviche limeno which is diced corvina. You can request how spicy you want it, if you ask for spicy it will be spicy. Causa de pollo is great, chilled yellow mashed potato cake stuffed with chicken. The Manhattan ones have this with crabmeat, drool. The parihuela is good too but just FYI, this should be shared by at least four people if it's a starter; it is huge.

For main courses, matador combo baby. For $38, it's a whole chicken with rice/beans, avocado salad, tostones or maduros (you have to ask) and salchipapas. The salchipapas is just a mountain of french fries and hot dogs but it's AWESOME. Drizzle some of the crack, I mean green sauce; sick.

The jalea is delicious too, a mountain of fried corvina, calamari, shrimp and yucca fries. If you're getting this with the matador combo, you should have at least four people because this will fill you up.

Sangria here is great and save some room, I love the tres leches here. I haven't had volumes of tres leches in my life but from what i have tried, this is my favorite place for it.

If you are looking to cater for an event, this is great place to feed large crowds without burning a lot of money. You have to pick it up but they can accommodate large orders within an hour's notice. Call across the street. I've fed office parties of about 30-40 heads at around $300. Not too bad.",0.0

Vics  was very disappointing especially since former five points was excellent in every way. We understand it is new and different but it does not stand on its own. The supposed Italian farmhouse atmosphere is not even close to what you would expect from that comparison. It is not cozy or intimate in any way. The music is blaring and the echoes due to no architectural features to absorb sound cause a conversation to become a yelling match. All this could be overlooked if the food was worth it but it was not. The garlic bread was so drenched in butter I started my meal feeling sick. The pasta and pizza were ordinary to say the least. If you have nowhere else to go because you are nearby it might serve your purpose but quite honestly ordinary is just not necessary with the multitude of options in nyc. Don't bother!,0.0

Disappointing is the right word. I came here for the hot chocolate and I guess I was not expecting a melted chocolate bar. Not sure if it is worth the price tag. Also, drinking a full cup made me sick at the end of it. Bad idea having the whole thing by myself. I needed two glasses of water in order to finish :)

The pastries are under appreciated here. They are quite good and I would almost recommend them over the hot chocolate. Let me know what you guys think. Go with the croissant. Nice, fluffy, not overwhelmingly buttery, and most importantly, flakey.

Overall, not sure if I would bother coming here again. I do not know if it is worth the trek. 

TIP*** - I did see people get a cup of milk and mix it along with their hot chocolate. For two people, you share a hot chocolate and then leave some at the end to mix it with your milk!!

"""Stepping its game up""

I made a vow never to come here once I realized that the supermarket was selling expired food. I mean cans of food had dust on them. 

So I decided to come back in desperation. After its makeover, this location is waaaayyyy better. Hell, it even has a craft beer section and an organic food section. The produce and meats are slightly better; but, we are talking about Gristidees. Hopefully, my mangos and strawberries will not be full of mold tomorrow and I will not have to cook the hell out of my chicken to avoid Salmonella poisoning. 

Also, the prices seem to be a tad cheaper than before. Plus, it felt nice to get more than three bags of groceries for 100 bucks. I typically go on grocery shopping binges because I wait until I have a half of a morsel of food in my apt, so I really try to stock up. Granted the groceries are not as ""fresh"" as other pricey supermarket chains in the city. Hopefully, the prices will stay in the moderate range.",0.0

"One of the Other Half's favorite calorie-splurge places, so we've eaten there many times over the years.   

- yes, it's expensive -- ~$24 for a breakfast / brunch entree, $7 for french press coffee, etc.  
- food portions are enormous 
- total decadence esp in the carbs zone:  fancy types of french toast, waffles, pancakes, crepes etc.   
- not the place for a diet: you'll be bummed out looking at all the stuff you shouldn't be eating.  That said, they do have fruit, yogurt etc. so you can eat healthy here.  
- mobbed, always.  Either make a reservation or be prepared to wait, potentially for a loooong time.  There are benches to sit but those are often full with other people waiting.  
- some people complain about the service but we've never had a problem -  on the contrary, recently when our food took longer than expected, they brought us a free fruit plate & then ended up comping us our entire meal, which we hadn't even asked them to do.   Which says to me: 1) yes, they are loyalty tracking (they told us when we arrived that they knew we'd been there before) and 2) that being nice generally gets you better results than being nasty.   I've noticed plenty of attitudinal snotty guests at this place, for whatever reason, & I'm sure the waitstaff get plenty sick of it.

Decent all you can eat sushi spot. Only one in brooklyn im aware of. Great for those day where you dont want to travel but want to just stuff yourself.  Decent selection of sushi. I highly doubt they use sushi grade fish but its not poor quality or old fish either. Ive been here about a dozen times and have never gotten sick from the food. Almost always follow a meal here with a few drinks from Wheelers Bar down the block from this place.  Biggest thing I have against this place is their Nazi approach to left over food- they charged me $5 for 4 pieces of sushi I left on the plate. Sure it prevent waste but comeone the waitress knows my first name. Another thing is you never get everything you order. They always forget something . I dont know if they do it on purpose assuming you cant handle all the sushi or the chef is just forgetful.,0.0

"They get a 2 for effort. I purchased a medium size tray of oxtail, mac and cheese, mixed veggies and peas & rice. The cost $20.00. The oxtails were dark and cooked well but it didn't taste like Jamaican oxtails. The plus is it didn't have too much fat. The 
mac and cheese weren't as tasty, the veggies weren't over cooked. I'd never pay $20.00 for West Indian food Togo when they're reasonably priced  West Indian restaurants up and down Fulton.Street.

"3.5 stars.

Like other reviewers, I used to frequent this establishment after late nights out in the city with friends,  the last time probably a good seven or so years ago. The food was worthy of 2 stars at best back then, with friends occasionally getting sick from the food, and the service was terrible at best.

Fast forward to October 2014, when my friends and I randomly decided to eat here for a Sunday lunch. I admittedly was afraid, remembering the bad old days where the food was potentially poisonous. 

However, we were all pleasantly surprised. I ordered my usual Singapore Rice Noodle, and not only was the portion size generous, but a generous amount of curry was present in the dish as well. It reminds me of the good old days where all of the restaurants in the area would have this amount of curry in their versions of the dish, but no longer. Most restaurants will dumb it down, perhaps to cater more to Western appetites. 

Everyone else was satisfied with their meals. 

Despite the food, this restaurant loses 1/2 star due to the lousy attitude of the waitstaff, which in general is something that apparently has not changed over the years. I am normally forgiving of service in Chinatown that is poor by Western standards, but in our case, our waiter had this true ""I don't effing belong here, and I'm going to show it"" type of attitude. I was afraid that he was going to spit in our food. 

If you do choose to visit this establishment, try doing so on a Sunday afternoon rather than wait until after a night of drinking and/or partying.

It is also possible that our experience was a fluke. We will no doubt be visiting this establishment at some point in the future, so I will update this review accordingly if such is indeed the case.",0.0

"Nach vielen Empfehlungen waren wir mit der Familie in Joe's. Getränke sind außer dem Bier gewohnt günstig, Preise vom Essen sind in Ordnung. Man sitzt mit Fremdem an einem großen Tisch,kein Problem. Von den 3 Gerichten die wir hatten waren 3 sehr gut und 1 ganz ok. Jedes Kölner Chinarestaurant kann bei den Nudeln mithalten, die anderen Gerichte waren jedoch sehr lecker. Toilletten sind nicht sehr hygienisch. Alles in allem ein leckeres Essen bei außergewöhnlichem Ambiente.. Die Stars an der Wand sprechen für das leckere Essen. Der Eindruck von außen täuscht!!",0.0
"Had this on my list since I began my search for the best pho in NYC. It's appeared on several lists from websites that I'm beginning to suspect don't know a thing about quality ethnic food. 



Got the pho with ""fresh"" beef and brisket. The fresh means raw, which is what I was looking for. However, I'm not sure how this place has a reputation like it does. The broth was overly salty and lacked any of the subtle aromas I associate with good pho. The noodles were overcooked. The basil on the side had rotted leaves still stuck to the fresh ones - guess they couldn't be bothered to rinse it more thoroughly. 



The final straw was after the meal when I used a napkin to wipe up some water that had spilled on the table and the napkin came away gray. Dirtiest table I've seen - and in Chinatown that's saying something. I'm just happy to have escaped without getting sick. 



Will not be going back.",0.0
"I went to  Locale for brunch.  I had a delicious omelette, the  Texas toast with nutella, and a body Mary.  The Texas toast was amazing.  It had just the right amount of nutella for an indulgent brunch dessert without being overwhelming.  Too much sweetness in the morning makes me feel sick, but the toast was fantastic.  The bloody Mary had a LOT of kick.  It was a lot of spice initially, but it disappeared just as quickly as it hit. I liked it a  lot. The fact that there was no lingering  bite made it easier to handle.  Also the decor is awesome.  It's cozy and classy and I love it!",0.0
"The store location is two blocks away from the intersection of Kissena Blvd and Horace Harding Expressway. So if you are taking the bus it's only a block and a half away North on Kissena Blvd.. Unfortunately it's away from Queens College so you are making an additional detour away from the campus if you are going or coming from school.

The storefront is always clean and tidy.
There is limited seating of 4-5 tables in the front of the store. Additional seating on the left along the wall as you enter for maybe 3-5 people which is like a counter.

You head  straight to the back to get served as the line starts there.

Service in this location is usually great. Servers are clean and and well kept. They wear gloves when handling food and usually only handle the register only unless they are switching off stations. They are polite and patient as I've seen some customers who are indecisive and make other wait along time. At those time one of the other servers will step in and handle the next customer.

Usually most items are in stock. The only item that is not could be the Spinach. I've experienced that later in the day they may at times run out of Spinach.

Their food station is usually clean and well stocked. All items look fresh. 

Preparation of food is fast and servers ask the basic questions of what you want with your particular sandwich and if you want it toasted and how which for some will be very important. Toasting bread with cheese before the meat in added or after it is added. Then what additional toppings you want and finally if you want a dressing on your sandwich. I would say that you get a good portion of toppings here at this location which will satisfy you and keep you coming again and again.

ONE NEGATIVE:

Let me preface that this something which has become such a problem for me I have chosen not to patronize their establishment any longer.

For me the MySubwayCard has been an integral reason for patronizing Subway. It's a service perk that I've expected as part of their store since I've been going to them. However in hte last two years their redemption card system has been problematic to the point of total utter frustration. Unlike other vendors like Dunkin Donuts, Subway uses a third party company to handle this and their system is ery rigid. If you don't do what they stipulate then you can't recover any points which you have earned. Their process is for you to call them and submit a problem report. I've done that a few times, but let's be honest who has the time to do that? I've lost probably 200 plus points already and I'm sick of the system so I will boycott their establishment till they fix this. I don't expect it to be fixed. Their prices have also skyrocketed in my opinion as it varies from store to store on how high the increases are and which sandwiches are affected.

Suffice to say that the Card Issue is sporadic and erratic . I patronize about three steady locations in the past. One by my house, work/campus and another by where I go for visits. No matter what location the issue with the card will pop up and at time will be permanent or resolve itself all of a sudden. I know there are those out there who like subways for the price and the perks of their card.  Take this review with a grain of salt as it has been a waste of time calling them and having to have kept the old receipts to redeem those points...",0.0
"Came here after a taping of last week tonight. It was a Sunday night/half our party was sick, so no one ordered a drink, which might have annoyed our server a bit but we soldiered on.

The decor and ambiance was great. I'm a sucker for Edison bulbs, tin ceilings and dark wood decor so this place was right up my alley.

Came with a party of four, we went nuts for the spinach and artichoke dip. My sister got a chicken club she was pleased with. Brother got a pricey prime rib entree special and my other brother and I got the build your own burger option. The fries and sweet potato fries were great. Ordered the burgers medium and they came well done, so order rare if you want it a little pink. 

Overall it was good. Not worth the $100 total w/out alcohol, but okay.",0.0
"I am full-on addicted to the vegetarian wontons in the spicy sauce. Now, if you are asking yourself ""What is this nondescript spicy sauce exactly?"" It's just chili oil. But after a toss in the chili oil the wontons are sprinkled with cilantro and all together it makes a very happy camper out of me.

But here's the deal with Vanessa's, as I am a self-professed expert on the chain:
You can only get the vegetarian wontons at the Brooklyn location.
They are not available to be purchased in bulk anywhere. 
(They are available frozen but they bag is mixed with shrimp / pork)
For veg-heads: I have observed cross-contamination in the kitchen with knives used on meat/vegetarian. Honestly, for a meal that costs me $2.00 I don't really give a shit but you might.

Sesame pancakes: Here? Not so great. But fear not: You can get the freshly made, perfectly crispy and fried pancakes at the Chinatown location if you can suffer the wait. Speaking of sesame pancakes - Regardless of location, do not bother getting them delivered. They don't travel well. Another word of advice: Don't fuck with the noodles here. Especially the sesame noodles. They are straight up gross and a waste of money. Stick with dumplings and dumpling-like things.

...and most importantly: Unfortunately, many folks I know claim that they have gotten sick from Vanessa's. I personally eat here once a week and I have never had an issue besides for a belly-ache from binging too hard but it's worth mentioning. Other reviews have claimed the same.",0.0

I'm sick with a flu and have nothing to eat and was really counting on that veggie burger.
After waiting for 30 min on the phone for customer service i was told they will refund me my money. No apologies, no explanations, no descount coupon, like GrubHub would do. Nothing. Well that is what you'll get from me now, nothing.

"I have a love-hate relationship with Xian!! 
I love their cumin lamb noodles but they are so skimpy with their lamb pieces.
that's why I usually order a lamb burger just to throw in the extra lamb meat!! 
the reason why I'm not totally in love with them is their inconsistency!
at times there's nothing better than these guys and the other times it can feel just ""ok"" 
but honestly no where else has the spice profile that the Xian spice has.

"I normally am not one to write reviews but I had to write one about my delivery experience. Last week I called this place to place an order for delivery. I was prepared for a stressful phone call as are most phone calls to restaurants when you want to place an order. Normally the person on the phone isn't very friendly and clearly hates their job, misspells your name or asks you 7 times what your phone number is, and always tries to rush my order making it very clear they want to get off the phone.
However, I was pleasantly surprised. A girl answered the phone by the name of Clara (I believe that was her name but I could be mistaken). Immediately from the start of the call Clara was extremely friendly and helpful. She talked to me as if I was an old friend, not just some customer bothering her. She gave me suggestions on what to order (which is very hard because I am not only dairy-free but also have a severe gluten allergy), even going so far as to check with the chef to make sure she had given me all the options. This meant a lot to me since a lot of times when I order delivery the person on the phone claims a certain item does not have gluten in it, however it arrives at my apartment, I eat it, and get extremely sick. She reviewed all my information to make sure it was correct but didn't ask over and over again which is something that really bugs me about ordering things over the phone. She did have to put me on hold to answer another call but I was only on hold for a few seconds and when Clara came back on the line she gave an apology that sounded shockingly sincere. 
When I was finished ordering she reviewed my total and thanked me for ordering with STIX. When I received the order there was a little note inside that said ""hey Paul! I hope you love your food. Just so you know I made sure there is no pita included in your order and also that your order did not touch pita since it had gluten in it and I seemed to have forgotten to say that over the phone. Have a great night! ~Clara"" 
That kind of customer service is unbeatable. From the way she talked to me on the phone, to her suggestions on what to eat, to the note she wrote to make sure that my food was gluten free....Clara truly made this delivery process much more pleasant than any other delivery I have ever placed.

"Came here with three other people the second week of July and had a mixed experience. 

The Pros: 
- great view
- decent oyster selection
- good flavor profile for small plates
- not crowded

The Cons:
- food is overpriced for what it is
- issues settling the bill

The raw oysters were nothing spectacular but tasty nonetheless. At $3.50 a pop, the same price charged by places like Union Square Cafe, I would have expected a more knowledgeable waitstaff, especially since this is an oyster bar. The small plates really are just that. The baked oysters and the crudo (with bacon, pear and grapes) had a really nice flavor profile, but the portions were astonishingly small given the hefty price of $18 per plate. At the end of the meal, the bill came. Luckily we checked the math because they were off by +$250. We explained to our very confused waitress that we did not order the two bottles of wine that were on our tab. It was removed. 

The takeaway: this is definitely a unique spot that has an awesome view and some good food, if you don't mind paying a high premium for the experience. Sticklers for service should probably wait a few weeks or months to give them time to smooth out some of their issues. If you easily get sea sick, don't come here as the boat does rock a bit. Also, this is not the place you want to go to if you are hungry and paying.",0.0

"This is another one of those places that for the groupon - they are FAR exceeding expectations.

When you first walk in, the ambiance and decor of the place is perfect.  Its small, quaint, giant windows, soft music playing, candles...the whole nine yards without that cheese-tastic feel a lot of places can get by going over board.

I really like how they don't limit your choices when you're using the groupon - the caviat is if you want to order from the specials, you have to pay half the price extra or something...i don't know, I wasn't listening, I already knew what I wanted.

The Beefcake will not eat french food.  Its an annoying quirk of his I just have to accept, so when I was poking around the menu before my friend and I got here, I already knew I was getting escargot.  They stopped serving escargot at Ruth's Chris (don't ask me why, it makes me furious) so I jump at the chance to order them.  Well done - not gummy at all.  My friend ordered the mussles with chorizo and white wine sauce....not only was it a dinner sized, it was effn good.  I know that, because I ate it.  Because I'm a glutton.

didn't stop there - I had the artichoke ravioli as my main course and I literally ate myself sick.  yes, I should have taken some home.  Did I?  No.  I ate and ate and ate until I couldn't eat anymore.  And then, while we planned on splitting the flourless chocolate cake and creme brulee...I ate most of that too.  The wine we had was great, a nice Sauvignon Blanc.

Now - the entertainment - one of the fella's working there must be related to the owner.  He's the self proclaimed irresponsible family member - quirky, funny, and very, very nice.  The neighborhood is great, and there's tons to do that.  Definately pick up the groupon, and bring your appetite.  For the price, you really win in this deal.",0.0
"Not the biggest fan of their regular meals but when I am sick or hungover, Mees's eggdrop soup with wantons is the most wonderful thing on the planet. An inexpensive and quick fix for many ales. The only bummer is they serve Pepsi and not coke. Coke is a much needed part of my stomach cure.

Ever since these new owners have taken over the place went pretty downhill . The place itself looks like someone's walk in closet with shit all over the place & the waitresses/waiters are complete stone faced zombies who look a tad bit annoyed when specific requests or extra noodles are requested. What really made me sick to my stomach  is the fact that they allow dirt bags to just sit in the front of the entrance (there is a small booth you can sit at while waiting to be seated) and drink until they're piss drunk and sloppy. That alone made me want to walk out. If people plan on getting drunk at a Chinese restaurant , maybe they should be seated in the back room this way we could feel like we are at an eating establishment and not your local broken down bar .",0.0

After an unpleasant exchange at the cashier which almost prompted me to walk out (in retrospect I wish I had), I ordered a Lamb Gyro. Paid $10 for it. After waiting for way longer that I should have, I received a small, sad looking gyro that was literally covered in grease, served with absolutely no sauces (well, except for generous amounts of oil, I guess).

"I have no idea with NYC Dept of Health did not close done this place long ago or rate it C or lower. This is cheap imitation of what I am assuming a more high-scale franchise from Japan and in Midtown NYC. The place is DIRTY literally dirty. There is dust on Sushi counter and containers - Sushi=Raw fish means must be literally immaculate to be safe to eat. And it is visibly DIRTY. 
The people who do sushi are completely untrained with ZERO cooking, cutting or any sort of food training or preparation. The guy who did this time took 30+ min just to do 1.5 roll and 4 pieces sushi. he cut up half a fish just to be able to get 4 fish slices for sushi. It took him several minutes to roll a sushi roll. IT took him 3 tries to cut that roll into 6 pieces. I can cut better than him. All cuts were unprofessional - dull cut of sushi fish where it should be shiny. The fish was fresh but if you don't know how to cut you get a dull slice. 
BTW. Bento On guys if you too cheap to pay someone with MINIMAL Sushi prep experience and just use some illegal immigrant mexican whose experience is cleaning floors and turning over burgers, DO NOT SELL Sushi.  And Do not charge the same prices or higher as nearby sushi places who do have sushi chefs with some experiences. 
The prices are remnant from Soma by Nature place (as well as all equipment) who did hire a person just to do sushi with experience in that field. 
When Bento On bought out Soma, they were so cheap - they didn't even bother to put on a fresh coat of paint and it is visible. 
Food that should be kept at certain temperatures - cold/hot is kept at at room temperatures and served as is. 
One time they served a japanese pastry roll with whipped cream and had it at room temperatures for a week, in Summer!!!. Whipped cream - a dairy product that spoils in a day at room temperature.

"I went here this past Saturday night for my girlfriend's friend's 26th birthday party. The place was over crowded and quite LOUD. It was probably a mistake coming here around Halloween. There were tons of loud drunks and assholes everywhere in costume. Now believe me I love loud drunk assholes more than anyone and on occasion I can be quite the loud drunk asshole myself but this was over the top. They really need to have some type of control and kick people out when it is getting to be too much. The constant screaming, chanting and yelling can get old. There was a drunken Pillsbury doughboy throwing Philadelphia Rolls at a Zombie who was chugging sake out of a bottle that looked like Moonshine. 

The food sucked. The rolls were small and didn't taste right. None of the seafood tasted fresh. The beer was shitty tap beer and was warm. The service was pretty good and they were quick; however when you are bringing unwanted shitty food and drinks to the table that resemble trash it defeats the purpose of good service. 

As if things couldn't get worse I decided to take a piss in the bathroom in the back. Walking through the sea of drunks was quite difficult. I finally got to the bathroom and it was disgusting. It looked like Hepatitis was created there. There was a large amount of rust and dirt all over. I pushed the lock on the door and regretted it immediately. I said to myself ""GOD DAMMIT THAT DOOR COULD HAVE JUST GAVE ME GHONNORHEA"" I scrubbed my hands thoroughly with boiling hot water and soap. This was a life saver. I then went on to pee and flushed the toilet bowl with my foot to avoid any further possible disease contraction.

I bought 'non-expired' soy milk and it was still bad!  I mean for soy milk to curl a month before the expiration date means that your refrigeration system has to be so poor and more.

Next stop is the health board, and then possibly the CDC should send a rep there as one could only imagine the filth there, then on to The Better Business Bureau.

"Ugh, I totally wanted to give this place 5 stars but so disappointed. 

Ambience: beautiful, comfortable, open kitchen, casual but mature feel

Service: amazing! From the host, servers, runner and bartenders- everyone was wonderful. Our water glasses were never empty. Everyone was helpful and had a smile on your face. Great service :) 

Food: this was the most disappointing part of the evening. Our table, 9 people

Appetizers: 
-beef tartare: weird texture, not hearty and as appetizing
-mussel cucumber salad: nothing special. Mussels were a little fishy, vinaigrette was nice and tasty
-poutine: our table loved it. Can't complain about French fries and gravy
-Caesar salad: pretty good. Simple- something we can get at a good pizza joint. 
-beef tongue salad: best dish of the night! We all loved this. Slow cooked, Shredded, nice flavor and a nicely dressed salad on the side 

Entrees:
- 2 cote de boeuf- beautiful piece of meat, definitely had the wow factor BUT just because it's big, doesn't mean it's good. Our table asked the meat to be cooked medium rare and it came out extremely rare, close to moo-Ing. For such a huge hunk of meat, the cuts were way too large and flavorless. 
- 2 tbone- really sad looking tbone. It was cut horribly, really lacked plating. The cut was extremely puny, filet side  was a tiny one biter. At least, it was seasoned. Not worth the 70$.
-1 sweetbread: ssssoooo disappointed!!!! It's so hard to find sweetbread and I was excited to see this on the menu but it was not done right!! It was sautéed instead of fried. The texture is way too soft to be cooked that way. It was almost sickening because it has a fatty texture. The sauce was delicious however it was like chewing and eating fat. If the sweetbread were fried, this would be the best dish, hands down. But I couldn't even finish it- felt like throwing up after a few bites. 

Sides:
-spinach- too salty. Made me cringe how salty it was. 
-mushroom- good. Simple.

"I came here with a date and a friend who raved about this place.  Let me assure you that after tonight, none of us want to come back to this place.  We were rushing to make it to the end of happy hour, and we made it by 6:45 PM (it ends at 7 PM).

.:. Price .:. 
This place is pricey.  I want to say it is closer to the borderline of $$ and $$$.

.:. Staff .:.
Host:  We got to the place and waited for the host as he was serving someone else already.  Two women cut in front of us just as he finished with the other group.  This is not entirely his fault, but it set a bad tone for the night.  It was now 6:55 PM and we were able to put in our sangria orders* in by 6:57 PM. Phew... right? Wrong -- Keep reading.

Waiter:  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food -- what to pair with what, what tasted great, etc.  Basically, he knew how to up-sell.  He mentioned things my friend who raved about this place said was great, so we got that.

.:. Food .:. 
Datiles (Dates):  Five pieces.  The dates tasted very good.  For $8, it was not out of the question.  I was satisfied.

Croquetas (Ham):  Five pieces.  There were very few pieces(maybe 1 or 2 nibbles) of ham in each croquette.  The taste was not bad, but for $14, I am not impressed. 

Chorizo Frito (sausages): Many pieces.  We asked for bread for this one.  It was decent.

Albondigas (meatballs): Five pieces.  These were probably the highlight of the night.  It's also $17 ($3.40 for each meatball), so make sure you savor these.

Sangria:  Not food, but let me mention it here.  I have had sangria at over 30 locations in the city and abroad.  It did not taste too strong, nor did it taste too sweet.  It was about right.  And for happy hour prices (1/2 off of $9), who would complain?

ME. Because our very ""knowledgeable"" waiter denied my group the happy hour prices.  When we mentioned that we had ordered before happy hour ended, he explained to us (twice mind you) that we had to be at the bar to get the happy hour prices.  This was not mentioned anywhere on the many signs, nor was this mentioned to us when we ordered it.  He reasoned that the dining area was ""more of a food area.""  I felt like I was being scammed, honestly.  I was so sick to my stomach that what I thought was going to be a nice night turned into an expensive annoyance.  I just wanted to get out of there.

I would have given 1 star simply because the EXPERIENCE is the reason why I go out to eat, and clearly, my expectations were thrown to the floor.  However, their chefs' bumped it up to 2 stars.",0.0

A few Chinese restaurants in this neighborhood have closed in the last year or two, so it's slim pickins', but I'm really sick of being scowled at when I asked for extra hot mustard when I pick up my order. It probably costs them a few extra cents after I've paid 15 bucks. Asked for hot sauce today with my order and they said they charge extra for that. Forget it.

Sara was seriously the best server I have had in Williamsburg in a long time.

A gin and tonic was $12, which is very reasonable and lasted a while (served in a shatterproof stemless wineglass, which was a nice touch). I expected it to be obnoxious or overpriced, and instead had a really nice experience.

"Mai oh mai. This is was my very first Yelp event, UYE, but it turned out great. The place is on a strip of Ludlow, where there seems to be a lot of hipsters. The restaurant really isn't that big but it is a long restaurant. On the night we went, it was brick outside, so it was relatively slow, but great for our party since we were probably the loudest people there lol In terms of food, I think the small plates were the clear winners. Also, the Ginga Kogen, which is like Hefe Weizen, is exceptional. It's according to the table as very ""refreshing."" 

The food:

Egg on Egg on Egg- sea urchin, sturgeon caviar over a bed of scrambled eggs. This dish kinda signified everything good and holy in this world. LOL The dish was good, but I feel the scrambled egg with a slight kick from the Uni were the predominant flavors. I barely noticed the caviar at all. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=spQBVg_hNazyU1sV6vuSqw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Tsukune- chicken meat ball, foie gras with poached egg. I am a sucker for Japanese chicken meat balls and this is one of the best I ever had. The inside was perfectly juicy and so tender. The taste with the poached egg went great. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0JfVJijhAHtO__Y2QZ2L4w&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA 

Foie Gras Chawan Mushi- foie gras egg custard with a dashi glaze. I was SHOCKED how much I liked this dish, I didn't even bother taking a pic of it when I first saw it since, I didn't expect to like it. It was SO FREAKIN good. I thought it was going to be blah, oh no it wasn't.

Uni Crostini- torched uni and Parmesan Reggiano flakes. As much as I liked this dish, I felt like it was kinda cheating. Torched Uni on anything woulda made it good. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TR6cftV9yLRF6GdwYrqKTg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Secreto Iberico Pork- Farro salad with kogashi shoyu. I don't really eat farro but I really liked it. The pork was cooked nicely, but I do wish it was slightly more tender. For some reason, the pork reminded of skirt steak. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dZgqgSRwBR3Zttud0t-Hmg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Pork Bun- braised Mugi Fuji pork belly and Gua bao bun. Meh, they were OK, at least they didn't put lettuce in it(I hate lettuce in my pork buns) I felt like the pork was missing the fattiness and it was slightly chewier that what I was expecting. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4k7KZEmEsZ-ICkCY9z4wzQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Octopus- pickled celery, zucchini and shio kombu. I thought this dish was nice, the octopus was nice and tender. The dish is served cold and the zucchini works nicely. 

Burgundy Truffle & Market Vegetables- string beans, snap peas, butternut squash, radicchios, endives in a truffle soy vinaigrette. I thought this dish was a little odd that it was cold. Guess I was expecting it to be hot. The massive chunks of truffle are pretty sick though. It was a nice dish, but not a wow dish.

Daikon Mochi- bacon, Miyabi nori with wasabi pickled Kyoto greens. This dish was not my fav, this dish really reminded me of Spanish arepitas. I wasn't crazy about the texture nor the flavor. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uBwKnP-10cA88xO1WzJTXA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA 

Miso Black Cod- Japanese mushrooms, Bol choy with a orange reduction. It's a pretty dish, but I was kinda disappointed. This is kinda the go to dish for modern Asian places and it was just OK for me. I wasn't impressed with the orange rind or orange reduction. The taste of the fish was slightly off putting and the glaze was kinda too sweet. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zVM_SNj1IiFlYWRMAmroMg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Bronzino Confit- Yuza creamed collard greens, daikon, red radish and mentai yogurt. Another pretty dish, too bad the visual was all from the radish. This dish was just OK for me as well. The fish was OK, but I wasn't a fan of the collard greens or the radish or anything now that I think about. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xEVT1-P8Rx5hcNuXVT8GjQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA",0.0
"I'm sick of New Yorkers on Yelp. I've read too many ""food and service was amazing but i hated the decor, so 1 star."" You're not all VIP, so stop nitpicking. Came here for brunch after the other EV place I frequent had a really long wait. Randomly stumbled upon this place, and went in because of the ""all you can drink"" sign. 

FOOD: I got the Pork and Eggs. Was it mind blowing? It was really really good. It didn't blow my socks off because well, its food, made well. I don't need my ego stroked and my mouth exploding from my breakfast experience. It was great - good portions, good flavor. If you're not cool with a high fat content, this isn't the dish for you. It's basically a huge block of pork belly. Most other cultures like fat in their meat, and actually eat it, we on the other hand don't. 

SERVICE: The waitresses were EXTREMELY helpful. I had never had Jamaican food before - therefore I had a lot of questions. It also didn't hurt that they were all drop dead gorgeous, seriously, every last one. Food came out fast and my ""all you can drink"" cup never went empty. Also - props to the restaurant for hiring a diverse staff. Thats something that you don't see often in NYC. 

DRINKS- I'm going to be honest. The drinks are good, but a bit heavy for me. I'll be honest and admit that I'm probably not into them because I'm not the biggest fan of mixed drinks. The bellini was good, and the hot stepper was good (spiced bloody mary), but I am more of a screwdriver kind of guy - which are not on the all you can drink menu. 

OVERALL- Great music, good food, great service, good drinks. Stop by and at least try something new. How many ""you think you're cute"" brunch spots do you need to go to with 20 something year old drunk girls taking 10000s of pictures?",0.0
"Hunger struck. It was a quarter past seven and six tigers followed me in. My Pennsix adventure taught me three things:

1) Spicy Beef Buns aren't a sexual pun. They're real. They rock. 
2) Oysters impress. 
3) This is not a bowling alley. 

The Spicy Beef Buns, covered in spices, surrounded by buns unleashed happiness upon my hunger. Calling it delicious would be an understatement. 

Oysters usually impress. They continued to impress here, not much more to say. Honestly it's only worth mentioning Oysters if they didn't impress. Then you become sick, vomits, green, the whole thing. Gross.

"This place is amazing. Why? Because they actually do give you free sample cups and don't guard over the machines like you're going to destroy them and spit all over the valves. Which is surprising because there are so many kids in this place. But there aren't as many drunks. So I think that is why they let freedom reign in here. Flavors are pretty amazing and almost as good as 16 Handles. It's like a fraction of a mili-second away from being THAT good. But it gets five stars clearly because no one hassles you for taking more than 2 samples and the prices are significantly cheaper than 16 Handles. 

I love Fro-yo. It is a guilty, sick pleasure because I'm pretty sure I'm mildly lactose intolerant so I feel nauseous about 45 minutes later on a regular basis whenever I spring for a trip. But it is SO DELICIOUS. They had an apple cider yogurt that was great. The Cinnamon Bun one is quite great as well and the Pistachio. They also change flavors regularly so you never know what you're going to run into. Like Nyc Cheesecake and red velvet. It keeps rotating. They also give you spoons with Looney Toons characters on them! YES! Bugs Bunny for the win! Toppings are generic. You have various fruits and mashed up candy bars, chocolate chips, a variety of nuts and more chocolate, coconut, nilla wafers, graham crackers, etc. etc. Frozen yogurt is healthier than ice cream, so why the hell not. But this stuff is loaded down in sugar. Like ridiculous sick amounts of refined delicious sugar.

"In NYC a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of rent -- 

-- and I can't figure out how Lahore Deli can afford theirs, in SoHo of all places, while never raising prices. Granted, this very hidden hole in the wall is barely more than 100 square feet, and it's a popular spot for cabbies filling up at the gas station across the street.

Really, the vegetable samosas are worse than any I've had - flat, soggy, greasy, with a crumbly potato filling that might be considered too generous with coriander seed and ginger. They're probably fried off-site, and therefore arrive to you hopelessly wilted. Everything gets popped in the microwave for serving.

...But as contextualists might say, the mediocrity of the food is unimportant. SoHo otherwise mostly lacks cheap, non-fussy, non-tourist-trap food, and Indian cuisine has an inherently high baseline for deliciousness. I've been coming here for a few years now, after a fateful bout of ravenousness while waiting on line in front of Housing Works Bookstore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/housing-works-bookstore-cafe-new-york) for an event. And I'm going to keep eating these veggie samosas, because I have $3 in my wallet and a little bitterness about otherwise spending 6 bucks on a couple of churros (cf. http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-churreria-new-york).

It's a very cramped space, not recommended for the very tall or very wide, with a few barstools for lingerers. A short menu is posted on the wall (listing each vegetable samosa at $1, but they really charge $1.50). For those with less tested palates, you can buy packets of Pepto Bismol arranged along on the wall! But don't worry, the food has never made me sick.",0.0
"I thought Ilili was very good. In particular, I was impressed with the fresh, rich, smokey flavor of the baba ganoush and hummus which put it this food just a notch above your typical lower priced middle eastern restaurant. 

In addition, the whole fish cooked in mustard sauce was excellent. Chicken kabobs tasted very slightly underdone, but they were seasoned well and we didn't get food poisoning, so, I can't really complain. 

The little square falafel were a nice touch and our dessert of light airy filo in a bird's nest pattern encircling rich creamy mousse + rose water was unique and well worth the extra calories.

Ilili has a stylish soothing ambience and seems like it would be a good place to go on a date.

It's worth mentioning that this meal was completely comped for me and as a result I cannot fully comment on the value. That being said, in my experience this type of cuisine is easy to come by - good quality for reasonable prices throughout the city. 

I got the impression that our bill was somewhat high (food, not liquor) and I generally don't like to splurge on cuisines that are easily accessible. It's akin to P.F. Chang's - the food is alright, but why bother when you can get excellent (and more authentic) Chinese food in China town for next to nothing.

In sum, I'd happily go back to Ilili but wouldn't splurge and would focus on the more exotic dishes that are unique to Ilili.",0.0

"NOTE: Scroll to the bottom to see why this is one star.

My girlfriend and I have been meaning to come here for over 4 years now. Yes, I know, we're like an old married couple by now. All I have to look forward to now is midlife crisis and college tuitions for my bratty kids. And yes, they will be bratty.

I mean how could we not come to Benny's, I practically own the place with them using my name and all. I should probably ask about royalties on that..

We ordered the Mole Ole!! Burrito and the Beef Chimichanga. We also had an order of the Salsa Fresca & Chips. I had really high hopes for our order as I had never tried mole sauce or chimichangas before. I started with half the chimichanga first. It was, to say the least, very bland. There was literally no taste coming from this deep fried burrito. The only way I was even able eat it was by adding lots of hot sauce, sour cream, and salsa. The mole burrito wasn't that much better. Although it did have the added benefit of having a mole sauce adding some flavor to everything. It still needed a hit of sour cream and a little bit of hot sauce though. I felt that the chips and salsa was probably the best thing we had. The salsa was chunky and fresh. There was a minimal amount of tomato juice making everything soggy. I usually hate having salsa because I hate watery salsa. My only gripe with this was that there was so little salsa for such a large basket of chips.

We were forced to purchase 2 bottles of beer with our meal. Ok, I probably would have ordered one anyway but what I'm about to tell you will make you do the same. The ice container, which is the ice that they use for the glasses of water, the glasses of cocktails, and crushed for the frozen margheritas, was located against a wall in a tiny pathway directly across from a dirty puke and pee covered bathroom. Guess what goes right next to the ice container. If you guessed the busboy's plastic container of dirty plates and discarded food then you'd be correct!

"Clemen's is a gift from the late night taco gods, and it's flashing sombrero is a beacon of hope for all those in search of the tastiest tacos!  I am aware that they serve food during the daylight hours as well, however, I have never dined here before sunset.  This is not to say that I am any sort of vampire; I simply have yet to be in the vicinity of Clemen's before dark.  However, no trip to the area is complete without a visit to this tortilla filled Valhalla!

All of their food is excellent and flavorful, and appears to be fresh as well.  I have eaten here at all hours of the night, and have never once been sick, unlike those other establishments that can make your post-taco toilet experience rather nightmarish.  My three favorite things in life are tacos, bikes, and the written word, but I was forced to choose a fourth, it would surely be pleasant poops.  Clemen's has provided me two of those four things, and for that, I am endlessly thankful.

It's also a rather relaxed environment, and often, after a night of drinking, I will come here to write while consuming vast amounts of tacos.  In addition to their amazing meats, they have some of the most delicious jalapenos I have ever tasted, and I will sometimes order nothing more than a large jar of those to snack on, slowly devouring their spicy goodness as I write.  Their staff is also quite respectful, and have treated my inebriated self with as much respect as they have whilst I was sober.  I love them, and were I woman I would gladly throw myself at their feet and beg them to make me their burrito queen by way of marriage.  I would gladly marry their jalapenos as well, however, I believe this country has yet to legalize marriages between man and condiment.  

Finally, know that my one star deduction is due only to their somewhat high prices.  To all you people complaining about styrofoam plates and plastic dining ware, I would like to invite you to kindly remove your heads from your posteriors.  I am a highly respected author, and their accommodations are more than suited to handle my needs!  Take a moment to think of all the places like Yummy Taco, where your food is served in a school cafeteria style lunch tray, or the trucks that send you off with little more than a few napkins and some salsa verde.  Perhaps you should just be thankful they even have plates and forks?  Furthermore, if you are unable to look past the fact that your burrito has not been served to you on the finest of chinas, than you are probably unworthy of such a glorious burrito (or taco, enchilada, tostada, etc), and if I see you people in the street I shall spit in your faces for disrespecting such a fine establishment!",0.0

My 3Q tea - no sugar no ice - came out to be way too much non-dairy creamer and barely any tea.  My friend's regular bubble tea (100% sugar and ice) was the same.  I had to double check the label to make sure i didn't accidentally order a ""milk"" drink, and sure enough it said ""milk TEA"".  

Where is the TEA?!?  It's sick.  Did I really just drink non-dairy creamer with tapioca..  I actually had to throw away most of my drink.

"Loved it!

Went here the other night with my boyfriend and his best friend. We had a great time. There are couches everywhere and the baseball game was on TV. Boyfriend loved that :)

I got the 1-900 drink - it certainly did it's job! I only needed to have 2 of these to get the feeling I get from around 9 rum and cokes, haha. Well worth it! The music was a little crazy (they kept switching genres lol) but overall I really liked the experience. The music wasn't extremely loud so you could have decent conversation here which was a definite plus. 

Loved the couches, the bathrooms were clean and they have a cool disco ball for you to stare at haha. Our server was also super attentive and nice - he frequently came back to our table to make sure that everything was alright and that we had everything we needed. He also gave great recommendations for food and drink. 

My only complaint here is that the food was a little bit pricey for what it was - $9 for chicken fingers and we only got like 4 or something. Other than that, I really liked this place.

Nope. Not great at all. For $15 (egg cost $2), I should have saved the calories and stayed home. 

The hakata soup was pretty decent. Quite yummy. The pork was very tasty but was charred well enough. What was most disappointing was the egg. It was sour.

"I just don't understand how or why this place has four stars. I went with a friend for dim sum and it was just awful. Friend was trying to be vegetarian and I thought, oh, how about Buddha Bodai? The reviews rave about it and everything looks solid. WRONG! First, we got the double mushroom congee, which I was expecting to have the richness and flavor of my mother's homemade duck egg congee; it's not hard to get the flavor without meat. But I was wrong, as the mushroom congee was utterly tasteless and the mushrooms had no flavor whatsoever (they made the mistake of not using shiitaki mushrooms). We then also got fried and steamed dumplings, the BBQ ""pork"", and shu mai, none of which I would recommend in any way. The pork had a sickening sweetness in a way that char siu pork never does - almost as if it's attempting to hide the fake meat under tons of sauces. The shu mai was just ok - probably the best thing either of us had - and use of shiitake mushrooms gave it much more flavor. Our least favorite part - and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THESE - were the dumplings, both versions of which were unappetizing. I love dim sum and typically finish everything, but I couldn't even force myself to finish the last two. The mistake they made was to use all vegetables for the filling; it consists of Chinese cabbage, celery, and a few other vegetables that don't go well with a dough wrapper or the dipping sauce. Any good Chinese vegetarian will know that veg dumplings can be totally tasty with a mix of glass noodles, chives, and mushrooms and select vegetables. Buddha Bodai clearly did not.

"SEVERED LATEX GLOVE FOUND IN BREAD!

My coworker came to work and told me this disgusting and shocking story. On October 19, she reserved a table for dinner. It took 15 minutes to get a glass of wine. While my friend was waiting for the food, the place served bread. When my friend started chewing it, but she found it to be a bit ... ""chewy,"" she could not chew it, and clearly something in the bread was not part of the bread. She carefully spit it out and ... lo and behold, she finds 1/3 of a severed latex glove. She almost vomited. She had to go rinse out her mouth and is freaking out that the glove may have been contaminated with any disease.

The wine was on the house, but with such restaurant, there is nothing the management could offer that would make any person want to come to go back.  It was so bad, they had to leave and find another table/restaurant because it was just so sick.

"YOU MUST READ THIS before you visit this place!

       Okay, so let me just clarify one thing, this place made such an impression on me (certainly not a good one) that I had to create Yelp account to share it with others. 

     So, living in NYC for the bigger part of my life, I have visited tons of restaurants, lounges, and bars. Although this ""restaurant"" I will definitely remember forever. That is, because never in my life have I been treated this way by the owner of the restaurant who seemed unhappy in any possible way. 
     
       On a Saturday night, me and two of my friends were looking for a place to eat nearby. Thinking it was a good idea we decided to see what Groupon has to offer, and this ""restaurant"" seemed as a good idea after we checked out the deal and the menu on the website. Though, before going in there I decided to give that ""restaurant"" a call just to make sure if we can be seated very quickly and also verify if I can use the deal for four people where you get a credit of $120 with only three people. The hostess picked up the phone, she seemed very nice but was not sure if I can use that deal, and she went to ask her boss - the owner of the place. Unfortunately for us he said no, although when I asked him if I can use the 2 people for $60 and pay the rest for the third person separately he said ""fine.""
     The place is somewhat expansive, so me and friends decided to give it another try and ask again if we can use $120 credit for three people instead of four, but this time we did it inside. Often it is easier to say no over the phone than when customers are already there.  I explained the whole situation to the hostess (same girl), we asked her we could still use it, and she went outside to ask the owner. She came back and grabbed the menus, although I understood that he said yes, I still re-asked her if he said did, and she clearly agreed. 
    The dinner was fine even though we waited for more than an hour. However what happened next made me sick and I wished that I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE CAME TO THIS PLACE. After we asked for check (which we never got until the end of the story) I gave my phone to the waited with the Groupon voucher (which I bought right after the girl said YES) and he came back, but with the owner this time. The owner slammed his hands on our table and said that he said ""it was only okay for $60 credit"", meaning that I had to buy another Groupon if I wanted to use it and pay the rest. First of all, I would never go to this place if the girl would say ""No"" at the first place. Secondly, the way the owner began talking to us then and later made me feel as if I owned him million dollars and not just $30 more. 
      It seemed very strange why he would make such a big deal of this Groupon if he was still was getting the same amount of money, plus the rest that we overspend on top. But, he began yelling at me and my friends so loud that the whole restaurant could hear it, and also threatening us that he called the police. Unfortunately he did not understand that he only embarrassed himself and made himself look very greedy in front of all other people who came to this ""restaurant."" What made me mad the most, is that he would talk to me and look and my friend and then do the same to my friend --never looking in our eyes while we were talking. He kept yelling at me, calling me a liar and he would never listed to what I had to say, although I listed to him. After we told him that the girl who works for him is responsible for it, and he as her employer is responsible for her, he said he does not care and we need to pay and get out. The girl whom he tried to get away from us as far as possible -- as she could tell the truth, only said that ""he was talking on the phone"" (probably afraid of being fired, obviously we understand), which is again not our problem. 
     Eventually after completely ruining my night, the owner agreed to use the Groupon (either because he saw that we weren't backing off, or maybe he finally understood how embarrassing he was acting in front of all the people who were sitting there). We payed the rest and left, as did the taste of the food we ate there. However what was left, is the worst feeling that you can not go back in time and go to a better place, where they do not make you wait hours for your food, and yell at you for half an hour calling you a liar and other different names.

    I think it is clear that I would not ever recommend this place to anyone, as this was my worst experience and I would not want anyone to repeat it. Hopefully this was helpful.",0.0
"Not to bad...

The place isn't easy to find. No big signs or banners or anything. Just a gigantic wooden door, ohhhh and a small chalkboard outside of said wooden door. 

We stumbled across it... Literally

When we walked in there was only two other people inside. There was also only two visible employees. A blue haired hipster looking bar tender and a realllly hipstered out waiter attending to the pair of people eating.

We sat at the bar. The bar tender quickly warmed up to us and overall she made the experience. As per usual I looked on yelp to see what deal if any there was. There is/was (depending on when you read this) a yelp incentive that said ""by checking in get one of 29 surprises, just show this to your server""

Both the employees had nooooo clue what it was that I was showing them.... They even called the manager who claimed ""there's no yelp specials I'm aware of""... And get this, like a smart ass new yorker the manager tells the employee to give me and my bud a hug and kiss as our surprise. Huh????

Well in efforts to not pimp herself out the bartender asked us what we like to drink.. And we actually teamed up with her to make a drink from the ground up... The drink was delicious! We dubbed it the hugs and kisses shot. So if you drop in and see the blue haired bartender ask her for hugs and kisses and know that you'll get a good drink and not a slap on the face :)

For food I got the chorizo small plate. And he got the shrimp small plate. The chorizo was.... Meh? It had this sweet tangy weird sauce on it.. If you've ever had those meatballs people make around the holidays.. Ya know the crock pot meatballs where you put ketchup and grape jelly in the crock pot and let it do its thing.... Yea kinda tasted like that sauce on bacon.. After a few bites I got sick of it.

Rob (my buddy I was visiting) got the shrimp. Now this strongly reminded me of shrimp scampi just without any pasta. His was delicious. We ended up trading halfway through because he liked mine more (to much garlic for him) and vice versus",0.0
"Having been to the likes of Nakazawa and Sushi Seki, I decided to try a less mainstream sushi joint. Sushi Azabu did not disappoint. 

There are four dining options for the omakase, $120, $150, $180 and $200. 

$120 offers the most basic, bonito broth, 2 starters, pacific ocean oyster, 4 sashimi, flash fried tile fish with ponzu sauce, 11 pieces of chef's choice sushi, clam miso and a dessert. 

$150 got you all of that plus sea urchin tasting. 

$180 got you all of that plus LOBSTER TAIL with uni sauce. 

$200 got you all of that and instead of clam miso, matsutake mushroom hot pot. 

My girlfriend and I opted for the $180 omakase course and had a limited edition Tiger blowfish. 

Overall the meal was incredibly filling and aesthetically pleasing. Each dish was artfully crafted and beautifully plated. As for the sushi, I cannot say it was better than Nakazawa. There were a few knock out pieces, but most of them were pretty standard. The highlight of the night was definitely the Hokkaido sea urchin which I could not get enough of. I will say this, the tomago at Sushi Azabu tasted better to me than the tomago at Nakazawa.

Warning: Blowfish is known to be poisonous and should not be eaten at any seafood joint. I did feel a bit number after eating the blowfish.",0.0
"I really wanted to give this place a positive review because I'm a huge fan of mom-and-pop establishments, but I can't. It was pretty bad, even by cheap-Chinese-food standards. The main problem is that, although the portion sizes were generous, there was very little meat. My pepper steak with onions was mostly onions, with only a few pieces of small, fatty, chewy meat. Where's the beef? My sweet and sour pork (yes, I ordered two meals - one for that day, one for the next) was mostly just deep-fried flour and cornstarch. A couple of pieces didn't contain any pork at all. Also, my pork fried rice (which came with each entree) was mostly fried rice, with just a few tiny pieces of pork. (At least, I think it was pork.)

I found each meal surprisingly soggy, and the sweet and sour sauce tasted like pure vinegar. (Perhaps they just added red food coloring?) I felt kind of sick after eating the sweet and sour pork. Also, the delivery person lingered at the door for a tip, which was a bit awkward/uncomfortable since I had already put a 20% tip on the credit card. (I used the restaurant's online ordering service.)

Now that I've covered the negatives, let's get to the positives: The portion sizes were big, the prices were fantastic (five bucks for an entree, pork fried rice and egg drop soup? Can't beat that!), and the food arrived hot and fairly quickly. These positives simply don't make up for the problems discussed above, and if you're looking for quick Chinese food, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. Hopefully the restaurant is able to resolve these problems (maybe they were swamped? Maybe they were having an off day?), because I'd really like to give them a second chance.",0.0
"I have dined in at Stage Door a couple times and their service is always fast and the food is good. As a frequent Seamless user I wanted to pay kudos to them for what they are beyond excellent at and that is delivery!

People of the delivery loving world: They read and follow comments every time! This is the NYC diner experience, at home, at its finest. Delivery is at my door in 15 - 30 minutes of ordering every time. 

I tried to make dinner last night and managed to give myself food poisoning. Future Darwin award winner? You decide. To cure my wrecked stomach I ordered soup from Stage Door and it was delicious (Matzoh Ball.) They even included extra crackers per my request. Soup came hot, well packaged and didn't spill. Perfect.

Having ordered delivery from Stage Door 150+ times over the past year I can speak to the best of their menu. 

My ""Best Of"" Stage Door Awards:

Low Fat Breakfast
- South Beach Omelette (w/egg whites) - Avocado, grilled chicken, chezzzz yasssss
- Diesel Omelette (w/egg whites) - Grilled chicken and swiss
- Diesel Breakfast Wrap - egg whites, grilled chicken and swiss NOM NOM NOM

Lunch/Dinner
- Reuben Sandwich
- Lean corned beef (Hero)
- Ancho Chipotle Panini

- Brownie Sundae - (Comes with walnuts but the best dessert on their menu)
- Iced Coffee (Exceptional for a diner and on par with your average coffee shops)

Goooooooo! If you're in the mood for great diner food there is no better spot than Stage Door. I love it!",0.0
"Sick pizza! I rarely eat this kind of food because it makes me fat from not being able to stop myself. This place is no exception, I could easily eat myself into a suicidal coma by attempting to devour a large pie all by myself. So, just walking in here means I really wish I had somebody with me to help avoid the lustful temptation. If I was blind and nobody could ever see me again as I went on living, I'd just eat pizza all day every day. Each bite is like a quivering mouthgasm that is filled with fear of it going away too quickly, so I'm nervously thinking about the next bite and the next slice and how it's just not going to be enough pizza to satisfy me. I've already been here twice, and I'll probably return again, excited and frightened and hungry and worried all at the same time.",0.0

Unfortunately, it took almost twenty minutes for them to get us our food. Finally, it came, and it looked great. But when I went to put butter on my pancakes, the butter knife pierced the top of the pancake and raw batter flowed out, so I had to send them back in order to get a fully cooked breakfast. In addition to that, my brother's eggs were undercooked as well, which is especially distressing when you think about how sick a person can get from undercooked eggs. Luckily, he didn't get sick, but we found the whole experience to be completely underwhelming and the food mediocre and undercooked. We won't be going again.",0.0

"THIS IS THAI!!!! I'm sick and tired of going to Thai places and getting the same tangy Pad Thai and overcooked Basil Chicken! I go to the place everytime I catch a Bway show. The vegetable dumplings are better than most meat dumplings. If daddy says that vegetables are better than meat that means they's be fucking delicious! I forced my GF to get her own because we love them a lot. I got the roast pork and noodle bowl. It was nice and STINKY!!!! Mad umami in dat bowl. The pumpkin sticky rice dessert is where it's at. Not to sound like a basic bitch but ""I looooovvvveee this pumpkin flavor!""

The place is tiny so you should go early. The staff is super nice and very attentive. I honestly don;t see why not because the place is like 7 square feet, give or take 6 square feet. Lastly get the Thai Iced tea. I always forget to order my own and end up mooching.",0.0
"I have been going to this restaurant for dim sum since I was a baby till now all my life as a New Yorker. I highly recommend for everyone who is craving for dim sum or touring around New York for some good chinese food or can you say, ""chinese breakfast/brunch."" The food for dim sum is cheap depending what you're ordering or how much you are ordering.

First and foremost, to find the place in Chinatown. It is on Elizabeth Street across from Elizabeth Center ( for ya'll anime lovers) who is looking to eat some good dim sum. You will see two giant escalators. As you are up there in the fancy smancy restaurant, be sure you get there early enough for dim sum before they finish cause the goodies sometimes run out. You will get this stamp card and it shows the price range list from small- extra large or specials. The lowest price for dim sum is $2. I highly recommend eating the sui mai first because it's the best sui mai dim sum in Chinatown! Other popular food you can try is the steam shrimp dumplings also called Ha Gao, Shrimp wrapped on sticky rice sheet, spare ribs in black bean sauce, bacon wrapped shrimp ( YES! its BACON, BACON BACON), and Spring Rolls.

In the mood for soup? Try a thousand year egg with minced lean pork. Its REALLY good and no the egg isn't old and expired. Bwahahahaha. If it is, we would be sick by now and poor jing fong would've shut down T.T

Highly recommend dim sum spot in New York or Manhattan alone. Did I mention it's cheaper than other Chinatown dim sum spot and it's delicious? Yes! Good combination to spend your money here for deliciious dim sum with a exceptional good price. My check normally comes up to $20 bucks for medium and large in a total of 7 dishes.",0.0

"This is a great, inexpensive izakaya in a cool basement setting. I first tried it on a weeknight early, dining solo, sitting at the bar near the entrance. Had the ebi mayo (tasty), saba shioyaki (cooked perfect), and katsu don (good, but a little on the bland side). Service was quick, friendly and efficient. Best of all - $3 pints of draft Sapporo! Is this NYC? You'd be hard pressed to get Bud Lite at dem prices even in Nebraskee.

I enjoyed my midweek experience enough to bring friends back on a Sunday for dinner. My hungry friends and I impatiently waited until 6PM for opening, killing time in the bland environs of that section of midtown (no, I do not want to go to the top of the Empire State Building, Mr. Shillmeister 1, 2, 3, 4 and the rest of you). Finally the minute arrived and we made our way down the steps only to be greeted with the warning that it's jazz night and it's a bar only. Bummer. 

Hence the docked star. Where is the announcement that on Sunday Mew Izakaya tranforms into a jazz club? There's nothing on their website because there is no website. Their Facebook page mentions music, but nothing about any bar only policy on Sunday. Sign outside just lists hours. 

And who wants to listen to jazz at 6PM anyway? Correction, who wants to listen to jazz anyway? I can understand not seving food while jazz is being performed as it would lead to more projectile vomiting than Mr. Creosote on a Dunkin Donuts binge, but how about some advance warning? Maybe a sign in the restaurant? On the tables? Outside? It could be simple: ""Warning - jazz on Sundays! No dinner service.""

"Don't come for the Fro yo. I went with two other people. The employee working was friendly enough and was happy to share tastes. Each of us ended up getting the chocolate Fro yo, expecting normal chocolate flavors. We each tried it and all thought it tasted off. We asked the employee. One tried it and agreed it was indeed bad. To me it tasted rotten. To the employee ""the mix didn't stir in."" There was one other employee working who refused to taste it because of how awful it sounded when we described if. 

Neither if the employees made any effort to make this up. Aside from offering us more of the same bad Fro yo. Yuck. I'm already going to be sick from what I tried, why would I take more? 

We ended up leaving fully unsatisfied. Another customer walked in as we were leaving and was about to order the chocolate. I couldn't believe it but the employees  were actually going to still sell it.  I told the new customer and once I did that, the employee wrote "" out of order"" on the sign.

This place is clearly cutting corners, and it shows.

The worst. Everything was clearly frozen. The food was simply disgusting. We should have known, as the table wasn't set correctly. But, my husband and I have both worked in the restaurant industry (me for 10, him for 20+ and currently), and
even though it was clear there was a problem, we wanted to give them a shot. We asked for spicy guacamole and received some disgusting mush that clearly came out of an industrial tub. Bland, gross. My chimichanga was the worst I've ever had. Frozen pork? 

Then, the server asked me how the food was. I asked if he wanted the real answer and he said yes- so, I explained that it was inedible and he said he was going to see about a discount. I paid and he never came back. I wouldn't not tip the kid, but the reality is that this is the worst place I've ever been to.  Thank goodness I had pre-cooked a lasagna, because we didn't eat the food at this gross place.

"I regret to give a one star, but I wanted to email the restaurant to have them reconcile my problem, but no email on the site. Every other experience has been a 5 star, but this ruined it.
I'm very sad to leave this one star review. I have been to Harlem Shake a million times and always enjoyed everything. The food and shakes are great. Every once in a while the fries could be warmer, but i'm okay with it because it is delivery. I love the atmosphere and the employees have always been fun when I go in.
Now for the one star. I ordered through Seamless tonight and opted to try the Donald Sweet Tea. When it got to my place, I thought it tasted like rotten fruit. I couldn't think of why. I called Harlem Shake directly because I wanted to warn them in case they were serving something that could get people sick. I asked the girl who answered the phone and she told me it is sweetened with mango. That made sense because I tasted rotten fruit. May I add mango is my favorite fruit and I love it in everything, except for this tea. I let her know my issue and she told me she knew it was fresh because they get it from a local person who makes if for them and they received it yesterday. She didn't even flinch to pretend like she was checking to taste it, she just told me I was wrong and said it was fine. I assured her I would never order it again and she said okay. 
I then called Seamless to see if they could do something. They called Harlem Shake and the girl told her she already spoke to me and there is nothing wrong with the tea, that is how they make it. The Seamless girl apologized for them not taking care of me and she refunded my drink from Seamless' end, not the restaurant. 
If the girl who answered the phone would have taken a moment to check the mango or showed some sort of apology for me thinking the drink was rotten, I would have understood. Sometimes people just don't like things. but this smelled and tasted rotten. I highly recommend you not order the Donald Sweet Tea.

"Celiacs beware- none of their baked goods are gluten free, despite signage claiming they are. Everything is sitting together (gf and non-gf are touching each other on the display trays) and before you ask, the staff wasn't knowledgable at all about cross contamination and they didn't have any in the back that hadn't been contaminated yet. It's a shame they go out of their way to use often-times more expensive products to make special breads for people who want/need them, only to ruin it on how they choose to display them. Smh. False advertising is going to land them into legal trouble very quickly. 

Word to the owners: though there are people who just choose the diet for whatever reason, celiac disease is a medical condition, an autoimmune disease, that requires a strict gluten free diet. These people aren't doing it for appearances. People with this disease (~1/100 Americans) can get extremely, extremely sick from eating contaminated or ""fake"" gluten free food. Access to this food is covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the FDA just released a standard for measuring gluten free foods for companies- the amount of contamination must be under 20 ppm to be labeled gluten free.

"I used to be a regular customer at Cafe Kiev. Like I would come almost every time I could since it opened in 2010/2011. I don't live in the Gravesend area but when I do come and visit my aunt and cousins there, I always go there afterwards for take-out.

I read some of the most recent reviews & I feel sorry for everyone that had a OK to a negative bad experience with the customer service & the food. I somewhat acrossed this as well. Most of Cafe Kiev customers are natives of Ukraine or Russia so perhaps they know what to come or expect when it comes to this cuisine & this joint. But used to appeal everyone I know who went there regularly too.

I recently had a somewhat bad experience taking out, after months of being sick, broke & not mobile. It saddens me that Cafe Kiev are under new management now. They did not really welcome me very friendly (excluding trying to conversate & the offering of Andres chocolates...My fave). They didn't even know I was a regular. The new owner even questioned my decision to take out my food & coffee to go. Like as if I was insane. The original owner before perhaps had most of his family as his staff, and they were much friendlier I must add. Not to mention they all spoke decent English & they all knew who I was. 

The owner now (for me as a Non-Russo/Non-Ukrainian) doesn't understand English well enough, got my coffee order wrong for an expresso (he probably charged me more for that too) & he didn't hear me or understand I guess when I wanted everything take out (as I don't  live in the area & it's a long journey home for me within Brooklyn). Perhaps the new owner doesn't how to run a restaurant entirely. However, I must there is MORE VARIETY to the menu now, even in drink selections perhaps as well. He thought I hassled him about the coffee after he made it for me to stay when I told him it was OK after wanting it to go & that I would spend my time drinking it at the cafe. 

But regardless,  I ordered my usual (Greek Salad) to go. I dont know how it tastes yet but its sad to learn in that instance that the original owner is no longer there. But he did tell me he was moving to NJ so I knew the end was coming some time this year. 

I am happy to see Cafe Kiev not closed down, because it was or still can be good, depending. If the new owner can make improvements on the menu & decor of the place, I hope he can learn how to be more welcoming to his customers, especially ones that don't speak Russian or Ukrainian. I hope the salad they made for me now is still the same. I will be very disappointed if it isn't,  as I come to know it's wonderful taste.",0.0

The service was good and while it was pricey, it wasn't unreasonable for a restaurant of such caliber in NYC. I made a reservation (on a Monday) and got a table for four that same night.

"On Friday I had the pleasure of trying out the Neapolitan express pizza truck. I received an invitation from Sarah to come and try out their pizza. NYCTalking.com was out to represent y'all! Anyone that knows me knows that I love pizza, I mean I really love pizza. Some websites will ask the question what would be the last meal you would like to eat before you die, my answer is always pizza.

So naturally when Sarah invited me over there was no question that I was going to come and try out this pizza. The short train ride and the brief walk were well worth it. When I arrived, Sarah offered me a drink and she began to tell me about the company. She told me a lot of things, some of which I don't remember, but one of the main items that I do remember is the story behind the tomatoes. Sarah told me that the tomatoes are imported from Italy, she said that they come from a place close to Mount Vesuvius. She was very proud in telling me that the only component in the sauce was these tomatoes. There are no added salt's or other condiments in this sauce. You can really taste the difference I have to say. Sarah was also very excited to tell me about the truck and how it is environmentally safe. In addition to this the boxes that they provide for take-out are also 100% biodegradable, and they provide recycle bins for your convenience.

Enough about that though, let's talk about what we all came to talk about, the pizza. I have to tell you for pizza that was prepared in under 90 seconds, in a specially made 900 degree oven, in a truck, in the middle of a street in Midtown, this was really, really good pizza.

There are two ways that I judge a pizza, the first way that I judge a pizza is whether or not I can taste all of the individual components. While I'm eating the pizza I taste for the sauce, I taste for the cheese, and I taste for the dough. If I can break down each of those components in my mouth as I'm eating it, if I can separate them and tell the difference, then that my friends is good pizza. The other way I can tell whether or not a pizza is good is to determine if eating it gives me a headache. I suffer from high blood pressure and I get migraine headaches. Due to this I cannot eat pizza on a regular basis because it will make me sick. But that doesn't change the fact that pizza is by far my favorite food in the world.

One of my favorite pizza pies comes from a place called Goodfellas LES. All things considered this pie was comparable with my favorite pie. The pizza comes out of the oven very hot so do be careful about burning your mouth. Give it a few moments to cool down and then sink your teeth into the deliciousness that is a Neapolitan express pizza pie.

The truck doesn't come out to the Wall Street area downtown, however if I am ever in the Midtown area or the Meatpacking district when they are around and I see the truck I will stop by for a pie because it was really, really good.

Let me preface by saying that I am a southern biscuit junkie.  I love visiting family down south just to get biscuits from pretty much anywhere because they are all good.  I even asked folks in SC for recipes so I could master them on my own. 

My co worker sent me a link for Empire biscuit since he knows me and my inner fat girl very well. Once I looked at the menu and saw ""Scotch Egg with Cheddar and Whole Grain Mustard"" and ""Spiced Fried Chicken, Pickled Carrots, Sauce a l'Orange"" I knew immediately that they were trying to hard to be different and it wasn't going to be up to par.  I ignored my gut and went anyways.  

We trekked from midtown to alphabet city. I couldn't order the southern style biscuit because it has pork lard in it ( I don't eat pork). I ordered the all butter biscuit spiced fried chicken sandwich with a sweet tea. 

YUCK!!!!!!!! WTF!

Biscuit = crumbly salty and dry 
Spiced Chicken = tasted like it had Indian spices in it which did not go well with the pickled carrots and the sauce a l'orange or the damn salty ass biscuit.
Pickled Carrots/Sauce = nasty especially on a biscuit.

Just what I freaking thought!!!  

Hipsters.... Yeah i'm talking to you.  PLEASE stop opening restaurants trying to be cool and different but falling short on taste.  I'm truly sick of all these trendy or gimmicky places where you spend $13.06 for a damn biscuit sandwich and a iced tea and all you end up doing is eating the biscuit only because the rest of it tastes terrible.

Lesson learned: Every city, state and country has their specialties.  Just because NYC is a melting pot doesn't mean that you will be able to reproduce something amazing found somewhere else.  Leave the ""southern"" biscuit to the southerners.

"Firstly, I have Celiac's disease & I'm always excited to discover restaurants that genuinely make an effort to offer gluten free menus. I came to this place right after they opened in order to avoid possible crowds & cross contamination from other customers orders.

Pala not only offers many gluten free options, they understand the plight of a Celiac sufferer & take the necessary care in preparing the gluten free meals.  I came away from the meal here without getting sick & I thank them for their efforts.

Moving on to the taste test, I tried a pasta dish & a pizza.  The pizza was good but the pasta unfortunately was not. Despite the food overall being mediocre, I was ecstatic with the experience here because I haven't been out to eat for 4-5 months prior to Pala due to fear of becoming extremely I'll from being glutened.",0.0
I am very unhappy with this store they are nasty and full of it. I placed a order that wasn't any good and called the store to tell them that it wasn't any good and I got the run around. they don't care about anyone at all I will never order from them again. Stay away from them don't order anything from them it will make you sick or it will be no good and they wont replace it. I am short of saying I hate them,0.0
"I called this restaurant from my home in Minneapolis , MN today to order some chicken soup for my daughter that lives in Brooklyn . The owner said they only go to 9th street , I asked if he knew of a place to order good chicken soup because my daughter was very sick . He immediately said he would be happy to bring her 2 orders and a pita , at no charge ! Wow , I am used to Minnesota nice but not so much in New York . What a lovely thing to do . I felt so good , especially because my son-in-law was out of the country on business and my daughter felt so terrible and taking care of a baby too ! I will definitely make a trip here when we visit ..she said the soup was delicious !! The pita was a special touch to a very kind gesture . Thank you to a very kind man I hope to meet someday !",0.0

"My girlfriend and I took just one bite and detected something wrong. The pizza, likely from the Italian sausage, tasted rancid. I called to complain and have a new pizza delivered. The man I talked to says he was the manager and denied anything being wrong with the ingredients. He asked how it tasted. I said ""rancid"". He said, ""what is rancid"". I said ""the pizza"". He said ""what does rancid mean"". If you don't know what the definition of rancid is, you should NOT be managing a restaurant. After a few minutes of him denying anything being wrong with his ingredients, he finally asked, ""so what do you want me to do, make you a new pizza."" I said yes of course I do, ""I'm not going to eat a rancid pizza, and get sick"". The new pizza never came! Terrible experience, I will never order from this Dominos again.",0.0
"Might seem gimmacky but this experience is a fun one, and the food quality and service is quite goof. Buyer beware: you will feel sick with food fullness. I am still feeling it almost a day later. As such, I don't think I will go back because I'd probably die of overeating.  I came for restaurant week, which apparently only gets you a few of the meats (not their top line filet or other stuff...but seriously if I had more meat, I would have probably exploded).  From $58 to $38 you get:

-complimentary pao de quejo bread which was cheesy and oily but not as bready? I've had better but this was ok.

- the unlimited salad bar. It's a mixture of standard stuff- greens, tomatoes, good asparagus, etc but also more South American tropical items like heart of palm, grilled eggplant (very good), strawberry salad, and an assortment of cured meats like really top line prosciutto (normally I don't like prosciutto), bacon, salami, and manchego, swiss and parm cheese.  You fill up just on this. 

-flip those cards up on green and get swarmed with meat, meat. meat. We tasted the roasted chicken leg (bf said it was dry but I thought it was crispy), chicken breast wrapped with bacon (good), top sirloin (nicely seasoned and crispy), bottom sirloin (also good, asked for a rarer piece- for the beef, you can get medium or medium rare since I guess all of the meats don't roast evenly on the pit), leg of lamb (I normally don't like lamb but this was well seasoned and not gamey or rubbery at all), pork sausage (salty, good), and pork rib (very good and charred).   TOO. MUCH. MEAT.  (toward the end, they will ask if what you're specifically looking for which is nice- lots of people on the floor)

-you get the starch sides of fried banana (like maduros, carmelized and deliciously good), fried polenta (strong in polenta taste but kind of just fried whatever), and mashed potatoes (our least favorite, a bit bland). You can get a side of scalloped potato (cheesy), white rice (standard) and black bean (pretty flavorful and I don't even like these). 

-As for dessert, thankfully, they gave me a small portion of my requested key lime pie. It had a lot of cream on it but tasted like the usual tart/sweet key lime pie. Bf had the cheesecake (it was a little dense). I'm sure they don't make the desserts in house.. so whatevs

-We had a bottle of the Trapche Oak Cask Malbec ($42 a bottle) which was acidic more than full bodied but still fruity. It was a nice compliment to the meal but I felt like dying with all the food and booze in me. 

-Finally, the space and decor: the space is a huge one, taking two floors and has a grand high-end chian like feel to it.  

I would recommend but like I said.. buyer beware; don't eat all day when you come.",0.0
"This is my go-to place when I have to work late nights in the office because it's the epitome of comfort food, and believe me; I need all the comfort I can get when it's going to be a late one. That, and it's conveniently located within a few blocks from my building so delivery never takes longer than 30 minutes (yaay!) after I place my order online through their website. I prefer this method because I'm sick of getting charged those seamless user fees, and I like the $2-$3 coupons I get via email from Eat24 (I don't know how that works, I order from S'Mac and Eat24 sends me coupons, which I then use to order more mac and cheese).",0.0
"My b/f and I just moved into the neighborhood about a month ago. I had a curiosity about Hookahs since I'd never done it before. Since Babylons is right around the corner from us, I convinced my b/f to try it even though he was a little reluctant. We went there around 7 p.m. which was a little early apparently, but we just caught happy hour, so our (plain) Hookah only cost us $20. I thought this was reasonable, but then again, I don't know being that this was our first time. 

Anyway, it was an interesting experience for me. I was a little nervous because I am not a smoker (of anything). I did find myself coughing after almost every inhalation, but I  found that more embarrassing than annoying because I felt like everyone would know I was an amateur! lol Babylon's itself is small. We were seated in the back right across from the bathroom, & we found the table we were placed at to be a bit of a tight squeeze as we were placed right next to a couple that we didn't know. That definitely did not allow for private conversation. But I suppose that that smallness could be looked at as being cozy. 

The Hookah itself did give me a bit of a ""giddy"" feeling. Then again, that could have been the 2 glasses of wine that I drank along with it... I'm not sure.  lol My b/f started out liking it but by the end of the evening (which was about an hour later for us), he started feeling sick, so we left. I was disappointed that I didn't get to stay long enough to see the belly dancer, who I was told comes on around 10 or 11. I don't remember there being a DJ and there was definitely no dancing going on at that time, but as mentioned, we were there early. If I were to decide to go to Babylons again, it might just be for drinks and not the Hookah (I don't think this will become my ""thing""), and it would definitely be later in the evening so that I can catch the belly dancer.

Ordered from this restaurant via seamless. I would have given it a negative rating if I could. I am a sushi lover and not a picky person when it comes to food.

"after the whole food poisoning debacle, i was very hesitant to return when my boyfriend wanted to have dinner here. but, we went anyway because the other times we've been to dee thai were fine. my boyfriend ordered the green curry while i ordered the vegetable pad thai. the portions were very generous, and my boyfriend remarked on how they use chinese rice, which, according to him, is a bit bigger than traditional thai rice, so he didn't have to order extra rice - he just dumped all of it into his curry bowl. my pad thai was absolutely delicious that at one point in the meal, my boyfriend saw how i was eating almost all of it (usually i eat half) and told me i should slow down so i don't get too full. but it was so good! they gave me lots of vegetables, too - snow peas, string beans, broccoli, bean sprouts, cabbage, spinach - and every bite was full of flavor. the only downside was that their service is a bit slow, but hey, more alone time for us.",0.0
"I went to the SF for a bestie's Birthday on 7/30 for 4:30p reservations didn't get seated until 520-30pm'ish. The experience to see and try the drinks was fun, the space is very small so reservations is a must. I wasn't to thrilled about the overall experience, it was just fun to go for the first time but I wouldn't go back again. My waiter Kali/Ali was very funny and great. This is a spot to go to for a birthday celebration the staff definitely makes it fun and they are very welcoming and courteous. You will hear a lot of glass breaking throughout your dinner due to other customers ...which I guess is due to the small space.. so for the future I do feel like SF could improve there space setting, which would definitely help the service go faster. Everyone is literally bumping each other, and I would have liked to sit through my meal without getting my seat bumped every 30 seconds. I had the ocean (blue drink) , my friend had the Mai Tai (which is the stronger drink ) . I felt like I had gotten food poisoning 1/4 of a way into my SF Burger Meal due to the meat. 85% of the time I DO NOT order beef based foods when I go out just because I feel like the food is never thoroughly cooked which happened at SF, i didn't want anything after so I didn't complain/mentioned it to the waiter, I simply covered my food until someone picked it up to throw out, I definitely didn't want to get more sick. Overall, SF is overrated, but it's a place to go to for the first time and experience the atmosphere.

"New Grand Buffet, I've eaten here twice now and I just don't understand all the bad reviews.  First off, it's a buffet, a honest to goodness buffet, one of those rare unicorns in NYC where a buffet is actually all you can eat!  Second, their prices are ridiculously low, lunch will set you back about $9.50.  So, if you're expecting that Vegas style experience....well you aren't exactly going to get that at McDonald's pricing.  Finally, the weird thing about this place is it isn't just Chinese food, they have all sorts of random stuff like crappy pizza, lasagna, and other mish mash of random stuff.  Probably best to avoid that crap because it's a CHINESE buffet.  Now with your expectations appropriately lowered, this is like your typical corner take out joint,

The building is dirty, that includes the water stained ceiling, the walls with all sorts of crud from the last 40 years, and the dark lighting.  The bright side of this place is the immense variety of food, the large number of people visiting here which means the food is turned over consistently.  And they have a large, well staffed kitchen rolling out huge platters to the buffet line.  

For $9.50, all I can eat for two hours and expecting absolutely crappy food, I can say I'm a happy camper as long as I don't get food poisoning and the food is at least passable.  I enjoyed being able to get my egg roll fix along with crappy lo mein and general tao's chicken.  The vegetables were incredibly fresh in the Chinese dishes along with the salad bar.  They have a little bit of everything and nothing was completely terrible....well maybe the exception of the way overcooked salmon.  But beyond that, I'm a fan all things considered.  Every once and a blue moon I'll crave McDonalds and every once and awhile, I'll crave god awful Chinese food.  Thanks for hitting the spot!",0.0

"Brunch is my favorite meal. If I could (without imminent death / health complications), I'd live on brunch... boozy boozy brunches, all day erry day. The girls went out this past Sunday after waiting 2 months for our reservation, below are my notes from the meal.

Highlights: 
- Wide variety of tasty, effective, bottomless sangria for us to get tuned up on
  (This PMSing girl's dream come true.)
- Chocolate chip & plain bread rolls warm with strawberry whipped butter
  Whoever invented this should be given a lovely gold star and then ship me a year 
  supply.
- Reasonable prices & house rules

Lowlights:
- Latin Benedict was missing the punch of spice/flavor I was hoping for which was a 
  fairly big let down after waiting so long to go here
- 3pm food order cut off kind of sucks if you're reservation is after 2pm, makes things 
  feel rushed
- Service was a bit slow / inattentive
- The girl who puked her brunch out by the women's restroom trapping both of my 
  friends inside... get your shit together folks. This is not the boozy brunch you should 
  be vomiting at, go to PS450 if you need to rage that hard on a Sunday.

Overall it was a solid meal, worth going once. Given the wait time to get a reservation, I don't think I'm in any particular rush to come back. There are so many brunch spots in NYC that I've yet to conquer & this just didn't make me feel compelled to wait 2 months to go back.",0.0

"Here's why they deserve five stars:

I was being an irresponsible and lazy celiac and not checking to see if their soy milk was gluten free (I'm also lactose-intolerant; I know, I'm the most annoying person in the world.  Don't worry.  I don't expect any special treatment.  I own my gastro issues.  Though this post is kinda about me asking for special treatment.  Meh).  ANYWAY.  Kept getting sick after cappuccinos.  Didn't make the connection (too busy rushing around, which is why I needed coffee).  The last 80 places I asked used Pacific Barista Blend, so I stopped asking because I felt like a jerk FOR asking. 

THEN.  Was looking at their brand while they made a coffee and realized it wasn't gluten free.  Sent them a facebook message and asked if MAYBE they could consider using a gluten free version.  Expected nothing.

They responded within a day or two, said thank you for bringing it to their attention and said they had ordered BOTH gluten free soy milk AND almond milk. 

Wait.  WHAT?

Love small businesses. 

So excited.  

So did not expect that.  Kudos to the managers.  You guys ROCK.  

The coffee is good, the baristas are friendly as heck (totally unpretentious), and I like hanging out drinking my coffee on the bench outside while scoping out potential dog-petting situations.

"Can't go wrong with anything here--been here for brunch and dinner, and they're always a smashing time

Everything, from the perfect bistro ambiance, to the tiny glass vases especially made for taking brandy shots out of, to the server chick with sick tatts. Such a hidden gem during brunch hours because you won't have to wait if you arrive before 1pm. For dinner you get seated right away too. Oh but wait, I hadn't even gotten to the food yet!

Brunch: comes with unlimited coffee or tea, and delightful homemade donut holes--they come hot straight out of the oven and are perfectly airy and doughy. Crab cake benedict absolutely melts in your mouth, with perfectly poached eggs, and soft homemade bread underneath. Hollandaise sauce is right on point. Their vegetarian options look solid too

Dinner: they have a rabbit confit seasonally and you must order it if it's available! The goulash is great, as well as the prebanac. Everything is so well thought out--each plate has a great balance of textures, flavors, and the different food groups. Some greens come on the side so you won't even have to worry about not eating healthy!

I would say the theme of the dinner was truffle! I was not complaining. Came here with  a group and we got to sit at a round table which was perfect. The meal started off with complimentary bread that came with an herb aioli. This was a decent start. There were six of us and we shared the shellfish platter for four. There was tuna, crab claws, and shrimp that were all fresh and tasty. I sampled my boyfriends pumpkin soup that had shavings of truffle on it and it was delish. For entree, I had the wild striped bass which was my least favorite part of the meal. It smelled fishy and tasted fishy. I ate half and thankfully did not get sick. It came with cabbage that had truffle on it so that made up for the smelly fish. Some side dishes that I sampled were the creamed spinach, truffle parmesan fries and mac and cheese. All of these sides were good except I wish the fries were crispier. For dessert, we shared two orders of the ice cream mini cones and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was the star. It was so whimsical looking with a caramelized piece of sugar that had sprinkles inside and cupcake frosting on it. It also had rainbow fruit loop looking pieces on it that just made the dish really pretty. The restaurant itself is gorgeous which made it a special dinner.",0.0

I have an idea, I think I'll take a Spanish girl...to....a Spanish restaurant. Seemed like a good idea at the time. 

Note to self: Never make reservations based off of the retards that post on Yelp. You guys are all on drugs...and bad ones. You geniuses wrote these reviews while operating on really awful drugs. Either that, or you've all had your taste buds removed by some twisted German Dr. as part of some sick LSD-fueled experiment. The review below me called it ""a hidden gem"". Yeah, ok, maybe if you just came down from a 3 day crank bender. 

I'd rather do shots of Drano than visit this hell-hole, again. We should have just walked out upon the realization that there was a grand total of 5 people in the entire establishment.....at 7:45....on a Thursday night. The decor in the dining room in the back made me want to upchuck the bad food that I hadn't even eaten yet. The over-illuminated room was about as romantic as the triage at Beth-Israel. Maybe a candle on the table?? No?  So, there's that.

Now on to the food: 

Let me preface this by saying, I'm not a picky dude...at all. I'd make an awful food critic because I generally think everything is good. I have eaten Beefaroni in the last 6 weeks...and I'm 35. Unless we're talking about steak (I'm an effing steak connoisseur), I'm generally going to be satisfied with what I'm eating. 

We ordered several Tapas, and all of them were forgettable, or worse, inedible. The smoke show Spaniard I brought with me abhorred everything that we ordered. This is not a good sign of authentic Spanish cuisine. The calamari was undercooked, as was the shrimp, and the duck/rice plate started off semi-decent, but as it cooled, resembled something that Fern would serve  Wilbur (Yeah that's right, I just made a Charlotte's Web reference). But hey, the wine was good (because it wasn't made by the hack chefs at this dump). 

Definitely check this place if you're looking to spend your hard-earned money on a bunch of crap, in a very lit setting with no people. If not, check out somewhere a bit better....like Taco Bell.",0.0

"I love when you just stumble across a gem like this and your expectations are blown away...

I haven't had any of the big entrees yet because the tacos and small plates are just so good. The nachos (get brisket on them) are quite possibly the best I've ever had. I probably eat Mexican food like 3 times a week. 

I rarely get frozen margaritas, because they are usually awful--they are either too sweet or too tart, the tequila sucks, the mix is cheap etc. But it was a hot day so I tried one here, and it was THE best I've ever had....by a wide margin, in fact. Nothing comes close. I inquired and learned that the mix they use is made in house and they also use blue agave for it. Awesome. I was getting brain freezes because I wanted to crush them so fast. 

LOL at the reviewer who claimed food poisoning from Pico. One trip here and you will see that is highly unlikely. This restaurant is super clean and everything is fresh as hell and made very thoughtfully.

But after the first bite,  I turned on the lights and realized that the fish was old. The sashimi tuna was very brown. Usually fresh tuna is a deep red. I stopped eating after that first bite, and it was too late to stop eating the rolls I ordered. I had completed it before I got to the sashimi. Now I'm worried of food poisoning.

Yes, this is average sushi - it's all you can eat; it's not going to be the best you've had.
Yes, there is damn lettuce in the kani salad - it was a mayo, soggy mess.
Yes, they did forget to put in some of our orders - in the end, it didn't matter.

The service I think was a bit better than expected, because our friend frequents here two to three times a week!  I could have sworn I heard the sushi chefs give a sigh of relief when we got up from our table; they definitely didn't make money off of us that afternoon.

Highlights:
-any of the shrimp rolls (4 pieces) whether it was shrimp avocado or tempura; they were all fairly decent
-any of the special rolls
- general Tso's chicken - amazing flavors!

Downfalls:
-kani salad
-the lobster; it made my friend sick to his stomach with the cheese they melted on top of it
-kani sushi pieces - they weren't even wrapped with seaweed; they simply placed it on top of rice  
- decor felt very average; like a take-out place

"Louisiana starved me, it did. My SO is from Louisiana and finding a place to eat during visits was a chore. Gumbo is a famous Louisiana food, and while it was everywhere, I couldn't have it. Then, the lovely got sick last week, and picky eaters make most soups out of the question, so I thought I'd do something nice and try to find some gumbo. 
NYC does not have a great many places that serve Cajun/Creole food, so I was looking around on yelp, and The Gumbo Bros was up as the ad listing. I took a look at their menu and lo and behold, vegan gumbo. Sold. 
Off I went. I didn't catch the name of the guy behind the fleur-de-lys counter, but he was incredibly friendly. We chatted for a bit about my SO, LSU and Louisiana, and we ended by him telling me that he's throwing in an Abita beer, that he hopes my SO feels better, and that I should pray for the Tigers because their season is pretty shaky so far. 
His friendliness alone was enough to make me want to come back. But the gumbo... Oh, the gumbo. I never knew how much my life was missing without it. I added a few splashes of hot sauce for good measure (and because I put it on everything) and it was so, so good I was sad to see it go. The lover also liked it a lot, which I guess is an authentic stamp of approval. 
Considering gumbo is an incredibly time consuming dish to make, I'm sure the guys at Gumbo Bros eat, sleep, and think gumbo, but I'm glad they do.",0.0
"This review is based solely on the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was good and juicy but what really won me over was the waffles. They were so so good especially with the three different types of butter (herb, berry, and lemon honey). 
Had a bite of the eggs benedict and it was fine but I'm kind of in a state where I'm sick of eggs bennies (after having too many) so I'm kind of biased. My friend loved it (but she loves all eggs benedicts).
I just want more of those waffles...",0.0
"I went into my dinner at Parm excited to try another Carbone & Torrisi restaurant. Their other places are all fabulous, so I had fairly high expectations. However, Parm did not deliver. 

We ordered the house-made mozzarella to share ($10), which sounded delicious on the menu. Unfortunately, what came to our table was a ball of the most rubbery mozz I've ever tasted sitting in a pool of flavorless oil. I took two bites and immediately felt sick from all that oil. Next I had the Saratoga Club. It, too, sounded delicious on the menu--bacon, lettuce, tomato, chicken salad, potato chips ($14). Sadly, what arrived to my table was a small, greasy sandwich with far too much mayo. I was starving and could not eat more than half of it because it made me feel so sick. I also tasted my friend's Linguine alla Vongole. The dish was $17 for a bowl of linguine with too much garlic (and I love garlic!) in an attempt to hide the flavorless clams, of which there were five. 

Parm is the kind of restaurant that should be great; the kind of place that should remind you of childhood meals. It is not.",0.0
"this place was great when it first opened...nice decor...new fresh Japanese food to downtown Brooklyn area...just what we need close to the office....but like most thing....that new car smell has worn off....15 bucks for a bowl of soup....come on....

we ordered take out today for our office....Ganzo still doesn't deliver...but at least they figured out how to serve soup.... in bowls...but it's still do it yourself ...

when I asked the staff about why they were not still delivering they said they would never deliver because they were too small...the place and the well equipped, well staffed glass enclosed kitchen is huge by NY standards....my cousin's a five star chef that cooks hundreds of meals a day out of kitchen the size of a closet.....delivering food can increase your business by 30-40% if not more...

We'll I guess they want to go for quality over quantity and profits....however that wouldn't be the case with today's meal....which brings me to the food.

My office is about 5 minutes from the shop....the add your own broth was cold/warm at best....the ramen noodles were still in the shape of the plastic wrapper they came in and clumped together...and my work colleague's chicken was undercooked.....I'm sure'll be writing a review when he comes down with food poisoning or salmonella....

but why would I write such a bad review.....when I got the bill....58 bucks for 4 bowls of soup...I rounded up to 60 bucks.....the guy who ran my credit card showed the receipt the other wait staff and commented on my 2 buck tip.....yeah 2 buck tip for takeout....no delivery....a poll of the office found not 1 person tips when they pickup.....If I'm going to tip next time when I pick up...it;s not going to be the over-educated waitstaff putting my food in a bag but rather hand the kitchen staff the money directly

oh I forgot the loud Hollywood celebrity I spotted on my way out having a power lunch... think metropolitan or barcelona

"Pretty chill place. Its nice walking into a fairly new bar. Everything about the place was clean. They have darts here with an automated score keeper which I thought was pretty cool. The drink specials were good and so are their regular priced beers. The beer on tap didn't get me sick so that's how I know they keep their stuff clean.

"This place was a pleasant surprise in the neighborhood!  We came on a Sunday night and the place was great, busy but not too loud.  The fried calamari was the best I have had in a long time: Crispy and really fresh tasting (even though Sunday isn't the freshest day to order seafood in a restaurant).  The branzino was delicious and the sides complimented it perfectly. The shrimp scampi had a really delicious flavor without being too oily, you could taste the wine and butter but didnt' feel sick afterwards.  The cocktails are pretty delicious too, you can't go wrong with any of their drinks. It would be great for a girls' night out or family outing.  My only complaint is that the portions were on the smaller side for my big appetite, but hey, this is New York!  Oh, the waitress we had was really friendly and wonderful. Thank you for a great overall experience.",0.0
"A pretty decent mom and pop place! It has a nice, home-y feel to it. I've heard that this place was popular and the line goes out the door most times but we got lucky because it was the day after Thanksgiving and they were able to seat our party of 7 together with no wait!

They have your typical diner menu options. I opted for the eggs benedict because I started an addiction to Eggs Benny earlier this year and now I must try it wherever I go. It was pretty tasty! Not the best but still a delight to eat. And the home fries it came with....mmmmm mmm! I just love potatoes in general and their home fries were a nice compliment to the eggs benedict. I washed it all down with a nice warm cup of hot chocolate (because coffee makes me feel sick and nauseous).

Overall, food was decent. I liked the atmosphere. Servers were friendly and prompt. If you're ever in this side of the neighborhood, give this place a try!",0.0
"Horrible. Never ever step foot in this again unless I get take out. Honestly, I'm not a picky person. You serve me the food and I'm happy. But the service sucks! I remember coming here two months ago with my boyfriend and a friend. I was pretty sick so I ordered a toad congee and they each had a sizzling plate of beef and swwet and sour pork. The food was decent. we went in around 10:30 or so and it was only a few tables that was already eating. However! We were seated and we bascially knew what we had to order in less than a minute, so we wave our hand to an incoming waiter and i assumed he saw us because he walked directly towards us. Turns out, he went past us to a table behind us that had a group of 6 or 7? And he took their order. Which I was kinda confused but rather let it slide because he might have not seen us. So he came over afterward and placed our order. Then things got bad. My congee came pretty quick and each of us had a bowl and there was still more. But then the beef and the sweet and sour pork took another 20-30 mins. I was done eating before they got their food. Ironically, the table that ordered before us, which they had lobsters and all the other rather fancy food that are actually time consuming, was already there. That got us pretty pissed off. Because I honestly don't think beef and pork takes that long to cook. Especially when you're not even busy. But whatever. We ate, got the bill. They even had a little section at the bottom where you can comment on their service. I didn't have anything to write with, or else I would've put horrible. BUT. That wasn't the point. The point was, we gave about 5 dollars tips for less than $40 or $50 of food. And we took off about $1 because of the shitty service. The waiter seriously came running after us and said we didn't give them enough tips. I thought, tips is what customers give you when they are satisfied??? If I am happy, I am willing to give more than 15% tips. But i walked out that night giving an extra $5 and I told myself. Never again.",0.0
"Without the Happy Hour deal I would never, ever, ever have stepped foot in this place. More like 1 1/2 star, but I actually went back to a 2nd time with a bunch of friends, so I'll be nice. 

IMPORTANT: my friend and I both brought over 10 people - for which they promised us a $50 gift card, which they NEVER sent. My friend followed up and was ignored. I didn't bother. They even emailed and called me for my birthday and to tell me that I ""won"" happy hour again. NO THANK, GIVE US OUR $50's AND MAYBE WE WILL BRING YOU SOME BUSINESS

The place has a restaurant, a bar and a dance floor. All in one room. Too bright to be a club, too trashy to be a nice bar, too loud to be a restaurant. What are they trying to do? 

The catch is if you win happy hour, you drink for free and your friends get drinks for $3-$4. Service was mediocre. 

Drinks are more like soda with 2 drops of alcohol AT MOST. 

Because of the ""deal"" the place is packed (with an ok-at-most crowd), it takes at least 5 mins to get a basic drink (eg draft beer).

I got so sick of drinking soda (and practically throwing them out) that I switched to beer. (soda is free at a lot of places; don't need to go to a bar).

Obviously won't be back. Ever. Don't bother with this gross place.

We had a second waitress because the first one left sick or something. This waitress was just annoying. Acting like we weren't important at all and that a waste of space and matter.

"My friend gifted me 2 meals and we scheduled the delivery for Friday. The order arrived on time and we didn't have any issues with the ingredients. I wanted to share my experience because Plated came to the rescue when I really needed it.

I appointed my husband as the weekend Plated cook and he cooked both meals perfectly.  My husband doesn't cook often so,  he gets frustrated searching our cabinets for ingredients.  I was so grateful all the ingredients came pre- measured and ready to go!  My husband was spared the frustration and the clean up was so quick and easy.  Thanks to Plated my husband focused on taking care of me in stead of grocery shopping and stressing out about what to make/ order.  I highly recommend this service for couples on the go.

Everyone who knows me knows I love my BACON!!!!!! I didn't even finish it (again like me) because I was too upset about it coming out partly still squealing.

"I have shopped here for years and never had a bad experience until today.  Late this afternoon, I bought a pound of Maine crabmeat that cost $35.98.  A couple of hours later, I made it into crab cakes.  When I began to eat them, I realized they had a strong smell and taste of ammonia.  I returned to the store with the receipt, the containers the crab came in, and the crab cakes.  The manager  (Salvador) sniffed the crab cakes and immediately agreed they smelled of ammonia. He said he would refund my money.  He did not even apologize until I pointed out that I had used other ingredients to make the crab cakes, had spent an hour of my time making them, made two trips to the store and, most significantly, now had no dinner.  When I asked him what he was going to do to make that right, he said he couldn't do anything because he had to ""check it out; no one else had complained.""  If he could clearly see for himself that the crab I purchased two hours earlier was bad, I fail to see the relevance of whether or not other people complained.  I feel it would have been fair for him to at least offer me four crab cakes from their prepared foods counter, even though they are in no way as good as homemade, or given me a small gift certificate.

"What's the to say about a Mexican restaurant run by Chinese that hasn't been said about Chinese restaurants run by Mexicans?  I think both ethnic groups know what food's suppose to taste like.  Now whether what they gave me was healthy food,  that's another discussion.  I had the chicken guacamole lunch special.  Not bad,  but not as good as the trucks they have uptown.  It is authentic,  more than what most Mexican restaurants in the city are like,  but there was just something lacking,  was it spice?  Cilantro? Jalapeños?  Maybe all of that and more.

"This place is a gem! The best Italian food in the city. My boyfriend and I come here about 3 times a month...we live right around the corner. Amazing service and food. High quality ingredients in a romantic setting. The owner Phil, who grew up in the city is such a pleasure and nice guy to talk to if you get the chance.

Favorites:
Chicken Soup (sans noodles) - the BEST in the city!!! Hearty veggies, and will also do the trick if ever sick
Calamari, lightly breaded to perfection
Eggplant Parm, the first time I've ever had this and was very pleased. Nice texture and flavor *signature dish of theirs
Pasta Primavera, this isn't on the menu but it's my go-to and delicious! Again, so many hearty veggies; mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, zucchini and yellow squash.
Penne Chicken Alfredo - my boyfriend's must when we go to any Italian restaurant. He can't compare anything to this. I also love it to dip my bread in (that's my small tolerance to alfredo sauce in general).
They also provide a basket with italian and foccaccia breads. It's so fresh and served with olive oil. 

We've never been here for lunch, but I have a feeling it gets quite a crowd with all of the agencies in the area. They have a nice bar with TV's too. They are closed on Saturdays/Sundays, but it's the perfect Friday night spot if you're in the area.",0.0
"Disappointed. This is one high rated restaurant. I was expecting a home run. I came all the way from Brooklyn. Both dishes we had were one dimensional. With the drunken noodles our taste buds could not detect any salt or sugar. I asked for it spicy. It had a mild heat to it. Drunken noodles is suppose to spicy. That's what we love about it. How can they forget the basics. Hardly no basil at all. The noodles were stuck together. I like my food not greasy but you need a little oil to keep the noodles from sticking together. The other dish we ordered was tofu & mixed vegetables fried with red curry. The mixed vegetables were bamboo shoots that tasted like the can it came in & those very seedy green Indian eggplants. It also had a few shreds of red pepper. I should of asked what they mean by mixed vegetables. all the sauce had going for it was heat. What is so wonderful about Thai food is the multi dimensions of flavor. Not this time. The restaurant was only about 20% full. The chef was out to lunch. Asleep at the wheel. Not mentally there. With all these good reviews maybe I caught a bad night. Maybe the usual chef was out sick. We wont be trucking down here from Brooklyn again.

"I've been eating at OMG Taco since they opened. After a shaky start, the quality of food improved and the service became quick, friendly and competent. However, the quality and consistency has been declining recently.

I stopped in for a late lunch today (Sunday). Nearly all of the lights were off, but there was a cook and a cashier ready for orders. The burrito I ordered tasted pretty bland, but fine overall. Fine, that is, until I found hair in a bite. Not a hair. Hair. Like a small clump of hair. I spit out the bite I was chewing and focused on not getting sick. I returned it to the cashier guy, pointing out the clump of long black hair sticking out of my lunch. He silently took it and walked to the back. No immediate apologies or attempt to rectify the situation. It wasn't until I grabbed my belongings and started to walk out until he shouted out, ""You want another one?!""

I got the Nova Benny, but realizing that the salmon it came with was smoked (duh, Mai!). I've never had smoked salmon before because it looks off-putting to me, but my sister (a brunch fanatic) assured me that it would be good and that I wouldn't get sick from it. She was right! It was crazy delicious and I can't believe I've never tried smoked salmon before this. I will definitely be back.",0.0
"Just walked out of this place, it's on the forefront of a slow wave of incongruously geographic gentrification, and its a cool neighborhood spot. We were here for my friend' s bday - very mellow, just 8 of us and no pomp/circumstance... We sat by the kitchen so I got to see a lot of dishes going out - looked fantastic. 

Being a New Englander, I'm a serious authority on lobster rolls, and i was exited to try it (I had heard good things...) several of us ordered it. Other dished ordered that I tried: fried clam roll, cup-o-chowdah and oysters. 

So being a lobster roll snob, I am hard to please. But it was great. Lots of meat, good toasted bun, subtle and unique spices - as expected from a new-wave punk-cum-hipster gentrifying force that has few regulars to impress yet countless patrons to oblige. The service was great, he allowed us to bust out our cupcakes off my friends bday without any BS ""Oh well, you have to pay because we have desert and blah blah..."" Just cool, keepin-it-real coolness. We appreciated that.  Drinks were totally reasonable.  The clam roll was INSANE. SO GOOD - so huge and perfectly done.  I would to that if I could go back... They oysters were so-so. I wasn't sick, but also not impressed.... 

While the food is overall quite good, I can see this place quickly slipping into complacent blah-ness as the 'hood rapidly increases it's built-in customer base. I hope this does not happen because this place is truly special and I hope it stays as such... I would go back absolutely - just know that NO ONE tops Luke's for a lobster roll in NYC, both in price and freshness/quality This place was great, but Luke's has ruined every other roll for me... Kind of like that college girlfriend who took 7 years to graduate and couldn't get her shit together, but she was so bonkers in bed that you let all the ""I'm friggin mega-crazy"" stuff fall by the wayside/be ignored...

"Pretty average food, but makes for a nice quick lunch. 3.5 stars in reality. I used to come here a lot. Like, have gotten 9 stamps twice already a lot (10th meal that does not exceed $12 free).

Today I got the tonkatsu ramen with extra noodles. It totaled out to be around $15, and was seriously the largest portion of ramen I've ever received. I kae dama pretty frequently at other ramen shops, but I actually did not finish my bowl of ramen today. Kudos to Kitto for providing large servings, that's for sure!

So the restaurant itself is quite small, but very tidy. It's easy to walk by, as it's actually the upstairs of a Boar's Head deli. It's very much almost ""fast food"" styled ramen. you order at the register (menu's on the wall), they give you a receipt, call your number, and you get it on a tray. The menu itself actually carries a fair bit of variety. There's ramen, there's pork buns and other appetizers, and there's also bibimbap.

It gets pretty crowded during lunch hours. I got there at 1:15PM and all the tables were taken. Thankfully by the time my friend showed up and we ordered, parties started clearing out and we got a table.

Anyway, back to the ramen. Like I said, huge bowl of ramen if you order extra noodles ($2). To the point where there's almost not enough broth. Almost not enough, but still sufficient. The tonkatsu ramen comes with maybe 4 or 5 pieces of meat. The meat itself can be a little too fatty, but overall pretty decent. The noodles are good, but not spectacular. They can get a bit soggy, but still pretty decent. The ingredients themselves are pretty fresh, but not gonna lie I felt a bit sick from trying to eat such a large serving of ramen today!

Definitely not a place for a date or anything, but swing by if you're in the area for a quick ramen lunch!",0.0
"Want a good example for ""quiet greatness""? Look no further than the Guthrie Inn. There's nothing fancy about this speakeasy-esque spot. There's very little in terms of decoration, dim lighting, only one bartender, and a menu that doesn't exactly scream ""high end cocktail bar"". But don't let all of that deceive you - this place is, wait for it, QUIETLY GREAT!

Came here on a Thursday night to find it quite empty. I went with a fellow cocktail nut, so when he recommended the Guthrie, I figured his word was good. We quickly got two seats at the bar and started quite the journey of a night.

We're both the type of person who loves to schmooze with bartenders. Not in a weird/stalky/creepy way, just out of general interest/curiosity. This guy, Francisco, was awesome. We talked all things Manhattan drinking culture. And eventually, after studying the menu for a few minutes, I participated in said culture. And though the menu doesn't stand out as being exceptional, the drinks were still close to top of the line.

I can't remember the name of the first drink I ordered, but if I'm remembering correctly, it had bourbon, amaretto, sweet vermouth and brown sugar in it. Thick and syrupy sweet. If the combo souds generally appealing to you but you're not into sugar rushes, our new friend Francisco recommends passing on the sweet vermouth, or just adding a little splash. BUT the star of the evening was the Sharpie Mustache. I remember the name because.....how could you forget a name like that? I was wary of ordering it because the base seemed so outlandish to me - gin and rye. I mean, I'm not saying I'm an expert mixologist or anything, but I would never think to combine those liquors in a cocktail. At least not if I'm intending on drinking it....

But our pal Francisco assured me that this drink was THE drink to get. He told us that he drank so many of them when he first started working at the Guthrie that he's sick of them at this point. I don't know how you could possibly get sick of this drink, but then again, I'm not a bartender. As the name suggests, this is SHARP. Like, eye-poppingly sharp. Like, I think my eyes actually did one of those cartoon-bulge type things. 

Okay, I wouldn't be a good Yelper if I withheld one of the negatives. At one point, our new friend left. I'm not exactly sure where he went. And by our new friend, I mean the bartender. As in, the only person working there. So...be glad I'm not a klepto?

Lastly: We ended up befriending another lovely individual that night, who was none other than Francisco's girlfriend. You know when you have one of those nights that seems like one of those classic New York experiences? Thursday night was just that. Sometimes I forget that New Yorkers are not just balls of animosity that don't give a damn about anyone else but themselves - it's easy to get jaded here. The purpose of that little musing is to say that we befriended an awesome couple, and before the night was over, we did shots of Jack with them. Cheers, New York!",0.0
"I so wanted to love marble. It's hard to find a great steakhouse in New York anymore. Coming from Chicago I suppose my standards are high, but even for New York marble is at the bottom. The only reason for two stars is because it's very pretty. Has a great atmosphere. Although the night I was there they were taking photographs and kept changing the lighting which was slightly annoying during a Saturday evening dinner. As for the food-- we started with the fried oysters. In edible. Literally. I took one bite and instantly got sick I had to spit it out. Which I can safely say was a complete first for me. I'm really not picky so to spit something out meant it was baaaaad. Then I ordered a filet mignon med rare. Nice couldn't wait. So the appetizer was Awful- maybe their steak will be good- that is what they're supposed to be good at right? Uh no. So first I got a strip steak instead of the filet I ordered. Then I start to cut into it because after waiting ten minutes the waiter didnt come back. So 30% of it was fat and the other 70% was well done. Awesome- I'm officially done with marble at this point. But ok, ill try the Mac and cheese because the picture on yelp looked awesome so at the least this has to be good right? Wrong. It was super grainy. I think they use egg in their recipe (largely a Southern thing), which can be good- but in this case left the cheese sauce broken and gross. If it wasn't egg-- then possibly milk that went bad? Either way, not good. So I ask my date are you doing any better? Unfortunately, no. His steak and fries were eh and also cooked improperly. So sad- looked so promising. Worst part is on the way out someone (who I suspected was the chef -- came from the kitchen)... Asked us how our meal was. My date felt bad and said ""great, thanks""... Fast forward to me writing a yelp review because I think after such a disastrous meal- the owners/chef deserve to know the truth- without knowing where your faults are you can't improve... Even if they did I doubt id ever go back. Sorry marble- your authentic steakhouse feel is not enough to survive.",0.0

The chicken was soft (??), the sauce was way too sweet and allll over the pizza to the point where it took over all the flavor, and the tomato chunks were pink.

"I am super duper surprised I had never written a review for Kenka before! I've been here at least 10-15 times in my life dating back to 2007 and each experience never EVER disappoints! It's always fun to come with a group of friends, especially when their main objective is to drink. Now time to give the real rundown from all of my Kenka wisdom and pass it down to the next generation.

First, get here early! On weekdays (specifically M-Th), it usually doesn't get overly-crowded at the open at 6pm, but the crowd will build up FAST! You will usually get a seat if you get here by 6, but as the night progresses a wait builds up. As for weekends (specifically Friday and Saturday), the most popular days, there WILL be a crowd outside before 6pm, so get there early to put your name down if you don't want to wait. Small parties get in fairly quickly, but parties of 7+ can easily wait over an hour.

Once you get in, you will notice nude photos on the wall and other interesting artifacts. It's a nice touch that peeks the interests of the curious, especially when drunk. On the menu, there are definitely some interesting tidbits and rules you should be VERY AWARE of as the night goes on. Some of those rules include no vomiting on the premises, no sake-bombs, no fighting, etc....the usual right? Any broken rules result in a $20 fine, so get that wallet ready if you're going to drink till your liver explodes because I've actually had a friend break one of those rules and pay up.

If you're looking to celebrate and drink heavily, I highly recommend buying a bottle or a few bottles of the sake. Great way to lose your sobriety very quickly. In addition, there are the pitchers of beer you can get or for the more adventurous the ""snake shot"". YES ""snake shot""! There's an actual dead rattle snake inside the bottle they serve you with and it's some potent stuff. 

As for food, there's plenty to mention, but some of my favorites include the french fries (with ketchup and mayo) and anything chicken, just to keep it simple. If you're looking to challenge someone, then by all means order the bull penis and turkey testicles. Call it very bizarre as many will, but they actually are quite appetizing, if unappealing. However, if you're looking to ""eat"" here, maybe those 2 items shouldn't be on your mind.

If you do stay here all night till close to 4am (closing), which I have done on multiple occasions, be ready for the very intoxicated that are still there to entertain you as they (specifically the girls) bumble, stumble and possibly even make out in front of you. All in all, it's a fun place to be when you're looking for a night out on the town with the guys and gals!",0.0
"I have been shopping at this store from the beginning, because they are right next door to Queens Health Emporium, the vegetarian organic store, which I've been shopping at for at least 5 yrs, probably more.

Queens Natural Meats is connected to Queens Health Emporium, but carries a very large selection of fresh, high quality meats, turkey, chicken, different kinds of fish, pork, etc., and much more too.

I am not exaggerating when I say that this is THE organic store to go to in Queens. I couldn't possibly write in one short review all the things that are good about this store, because it would be a giant list, but I'll write a few most important things:

- the owners Will and Francesca are very knowledgeable about quality food, and have fresh, tasty, very high quality foods daily

- Francesca is an excellent cook (she used to cook for TV), and so the menu of foods that they prepare daily, varies day to day, so you don't get bored. 

- the store has both organic meats, as well as 'antibiotic free, hormone free, free range, etc', some of which are from Europe, which are higher quality meats than American, because in Europe they don't use all that chemical stuff, they just treat their animals better, so they don't get sick and don't need all that crap. And Will is very knowledgeable about when its best to make sure a food has the organic label, and when its best to buy from Europe.

- Besides meats, they prepare all sorts of other foods: salads, vegetables, soups, stews, quiches, rice, and have a full assortment of healthy and tasty deli foods to create a balanced meal

- they sell bread and pastries also. they have snacks, drinks and all sorts of organic beers, combucha, dairy products: milk, yogurts, cheeses. basically they have a little bit of everything (except fresh vegetables, which you would get next door, at Queens Health Emporium)

- They sometimes deliver food. When my mother was sick around Christmas time, and couldn't go to the store, nor cook holiday meals, she ordered a lot of food from them, and they delivered it to her home. I was very very impressed with that and grateful that they did that for her. I'm sure it was not a standard thing.

- The store is modern. its a beautiful place to be in. my son (who is 4) wants to sit at the table and eat there, because the atmosphere and energy there is so nice. 

If I have to move from this neighborhood one day, this store will be the #1 thing I'll really miss. I've gone to so many places in this country, that don't have an organic store nearby, and there is no way I could live that way. I really don't understand how people who want to eat healthy, can go without a health food store in their neighborhood. If you're a busy person, like me, and can't spend time gardening and preparing all your food, but want to eat healthy organic quality food, then this store is definitely for you. They've saved me many times, when I had 0 time to cook, and I could just run quickly into the store, and they would always have an excellent selection of healthy foods.

I couldn't ask for anything more, except that perhaps Will should create a chain ;)",0.0
"I give this restaurant two stars solely because I surprisingly didn't get food poisoning after this meal. The atmosphere and service were extremely lackluster, which could easily have been overlooked if the food had been even marginally tasty. I went in on a Saturday evening craving some fresh Asian food. After trying the spring rolls, pulled pork sandwich, and chicken/buckwheat salad, each dish gave me the distinct impression that it had been prepared and left out on the counter at least a day ago. The food was neither fresh nor tasty. Not only would I not go again, but I discourage others from trying it and risking their own food poisoning luck.",0.0
"This is, now, my last resort grocery store in the area. On more than one occasion, I have purchased spoiled produce. Most recently (yesterday), I bought what I thought would be the perfect watermelon for a BBQ I was throwing last night. Then I sliced into it and encountered a pink slimy, smelly mess.  Gross. 



The worst experience I had as a C Town customer, though (and the last time I purchased meat from there), was about a year ago when I purchased three racks of ribs.  Later that day, I cut into the plastic bag containing the first rack and was confronted with the rancid smell of rotten eggs. The second and the third racks had the same issue. When I returned the ribs, it was an ordeal for me to get my money back. 



I now have a policy that I will not buy anything that is supposed to be fresh from C-Town. No, thank you - I do not need a side of food poisoning with my chicken.",0.0
"I'm afraid I have to add to the negative reviews. I don't usually write reviews, but I felt I needed to warn people about this place. Like many, I made a reservation for hibachi to celebrate a birthday - my son's 11th. He had his friends there, all of them 10 or 11 years old. I made a reservation for 4:30. We got there at 4:25. At 4:50, they took our order, and at 5:30, the chef finally came. At various points in that hour, I was told that the delay had to do with 1. us being late (not true), 2. the chef being late (I think this was true), and 3. the other chef called in sick (I don't think this was true). Knowing that many people reserve for birthdays, the management should really consider getting a back up chef in case there is actually more than one reservation at 4:30.

We had come from a Mets game, and the very active kids were starving by the time we sat down. We got through a whole hour of waiting and whining, but as I told the hostess, my son only has one 11th birthday, and the restaurant did nothing to make it a good memory. 

I do not go for the food. The seafood is chemically preserved and not fresh, and the rest is mediocre. I go because my son likes the chef's antics, which is why one of the other solutions the hostess offered wouldn't have worked - to have food cooked in the kitchen and brought out.",0.0
"I ordered delivery from Oishi Bay last night for the first time.  It was simply not good.  The pork gyoza were cold upon arrival.  They might have tasted good if they were warm.  The sushi was also a disappointment,  It did not make me sick at all, but it did not taste particularly fresh - nor was it delicious.  I felt as though I was eating day-old sushi.  On the plus side- the food was delivered quickly and was inexpensive, but I would rather pay more for fish that tastes good.  I did not even finish my meal.  If you are interested in cheap and edible sushi, this may be a good spot for you. If you are interested in fresh and delicious sushi, I would pass on Oishi Bay.",0.0
"The best Italian meals we have ever enjoyed were at Angelo's Pizza in New York City. 

My daughter marveled at the difference in their cheese ravioli.  Obviously home-made, she said they literally melted in her mouth.  

The brick-oven pizza completely redefined my family's concept of what a pizza can be:  layers of flavor, thin, crispy, while also being substantial.  

And man-o-man the cut of salmon I had was the best I have ever had.  It was thick and grilled to perfection!  


The Tiramisu?  

Redefined entirely at a whole new level.  

Cannolis?  

Never had them till now, but good grief!  The crispy shell coupled with the creamy sweet ricotta filling was the perfect balance of the sweet and the savory.  

The finely grated pistachio nuts for garnish and beautifully-sculpted strawberry brought the whole protein element into play, making this a wonderful desert that does not make a person feel sick!  

We feel so blessed to have stumbled across this place--and our knowledgeable, fun, friendly waitress, Tina, whom we asked for again on our last visit, that we felt compelled to help other travelers by steering them to a place that guarantees them their best meal of the year!",0.0
"I was there Saturday night with a party of six. We were anxious to try this place since receiving the flyer in the mail. We made a reservation and arrived on time. It took a while before someone brought us warm water. Only one person working on the floor both waiting and bussing. We asked if he was alone, his response was someone couldnt show up due to the weather. But that couldnt be true because others have said the same thing on a different night. Waiter finally came over and told us that four basic items on the menu were not available. Macaroni and Cheese...not available? You couldnt make it fresh? strike one! After sitting there for a while he took our drink order. After 15 minutes he brought two...and waited another 10 minutes...see the lady bartenders chit-chatting with each other but not making drinks...strike two! Waited some more and noticed no one was getting much of anything. The waiter's attitude made you feel like you were prviledged to be there...strike three! We asked for the check and left. He couldnt understand why we wanted to leave and really didnt care. We were there an hour for two drinks! Glad we left after we read a review of a party of six all getting sick that night. They mentioned people leaving because of the service. But they will make excuses about the snow, the phone company and everything else other than ""please come back and we will make it up to you"".

"My son's class went to this farm (if it can be called such!) on Monday 10/7/13.  I was horrified! The poor animals chained by the neck with heavy chains and locks looking sickly and sad crammed in a box where they cannot lay down if they chose to. One of the little girls in my son's class began crying when yet another cow barely had the strength to eat it's hay and she wanted us to unchain it and take it to the ""doctor."" The chickens in the coop are SICK!  One literally keeled over and died. A few moments later another keeled over!  I began screaming for my son to get the hell out of the coop as I saw other chickens were sick. The teachers then began screaming for their students to get out as well. My son's teacher went to complain about what happened and the condition of the farm animals. She was given several tickets to return in the future. She offered me a few tickets and I absolutely refused.  My son is now sick.  He has been vomiting for the last 3 days and the doctor believes it may be a parasite. Is it from this hell hole?  Who knows, but the doctor is running every lab test imaginable to rule it out.  I am DEFINITELY calling every health and animal agency I can think of!!!",0.0

"First off the steak and drinks here are phenomenal.  Tender, juicy, they know how to cook a medium rare.  The sides were pretty good also, asparagus & cheese fries & mac& cheese were all delicious.  Maybe a tad too much salt on the mac & cheese.  Mojito, dark & stormy, and tequila cocktails all strong & tasty.  They have a large wine and spirits menu as well.  My only qualm is the service.  It's so slow & shoddy that I had to get up & ask one of the assistants to send my waitress over at least twice.  The Maybe they were short on the shift or someone called in sick, but I've never had such slow, intermittent service in FiDi before.  So all in all, go for the food but be prepared to have to get up & ask yourself for water, drinks, etc.",0.0
"I have been to this place for brunch which was good.  Yesterday I went for dinner with several friends.  Our reservation was for 7:30.  We arrived on the dot and were  immediately seated. It wasn't crowded.   The waitress came back several times to clarify our orders.  I wondered what exactly she was writingeach time since she had to come back so many times (for the drinks, apps and dinner order).  However, she was vvery nice.  I am not able to eat anything even mildly spicy and I wanted the ribs.  She was kind enough to let me taste the bbq sauce before placing the order.  It was too spicy for me.  Who goes to a steak house and orders chicken?  Unfortunately me.  I couldnt risk getting sick because something I ate was too spicy.  So I stayed safe.",0.0
"Tough to review this place as they are nice people and a lot nicer than The Juice Press in the East Village.  Their product is great, the staff is friendly and the place is clean and well maintained.  But I'm writing this review because I am sick and tired of their horrendous delivery service.  I have never and I repeat never received a delivery within 45 minutes.  It is most often the case that their deliveries take upwards of 1 hour.  Sometimes they've pushed north of 90 minutes and arrived to me two hours after I called.  They are constantly ""short delivery guys.""  There was a time in NYC when food establishments prided themselves on getting their deliveries out the door in a timely fashion.  No one should have to wait this long for three bottles of juice.  Liquiteria needs to get their delivery service in check.  Either get your stuff out the door quickly or cease delivery service.  The owner Doug should revamp this piece of his business.  It has been this way for years so I doubt it will change, but if it does, Liquiteria will be in a better place from the consumers point of view.",0.0

"My sister and I were so excited about this place. From the outside it looked like this is exactly what Sunnyside needed. I went there on a Sunday afternoon and it was not very busy. We ordered two orders of pork chives dumplings and a vegetable one. We got the order and one of the orders of dumplings were raw!!! Like the meat inside was red. Even though we waited quite awhile for the orders for some reason all of the orders were not hot. I bit into the raw order and spit it out bc it was cold, mushy and just disgusting. I brought it to the cashier's attention but he said it is beef and kimchi and that it is not raw. We never ordered beef and kimchi so I dont know how it was beef kimchi. I didnt want to cause a scene and ruin our Sunday so I just threw it out and left. I am so disappointed, even if that order of dumplings were not RAW the rest was just not that good. Lets just hope I dont get sick from biting into raw (presumably low quality) meat.",0.0
"A pleasant experience indeed.

My guy friend and I came here for the first time and was pretty excited as this place has great reviews!
I love ramen and wanted to come here when Ramen King came to town but missed out.
Either way, I knew I had to come for a taste to see what everyone is raving about.

First off, the wait for this place is ridiculously long!  We waited for over an hour before being seated, and this was on a Monday night!  Imagine if we had came on a weekend, whew!
Once seated, we were greeted by our server and beverages quickly came out.
We ordered the Pork Hirata Buns which were DEliciousss.  Amazing flavors, I wanted more!
We also ordered Hirata Chicken Wings.  They were also very tasty but I would take the buns over this any day!  Salivating as I recall the taste :D

As for the ramen, I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend had the Karaka Men.  I love spicy food but was sick so I chose not to have anything spicy.  
I was more than happy with my pick as it was soooo scrumptiously good.  I really love food and this place is probably one of my favorites now.  Although a bit pricy but to me, they were worth every penny...oh and even the long wait! ^_~;

"The raw oysters I had here tonight were surprisingly tasty. I hope I don't get food poisoning but for the most part I seem to be doing alright. Sushi here got a lot better. You can tell the raw fish here is fresh. Although not the best options when it comes to sushi rolls but it serves the purpose for hungry people. The cheesecake I had was delicious as well as the banana pudding. Omg the banana pudding was moneyyy. I would go back just for some, for real. They even have crawfish here which I definitely tried for the first time. I loved it. It had a cajun spice to it.

Anywho for $20, I feel like my money was well spent. The oysters I had, crawfish, cheesecake, chicken herbal soup, BANANA PUDDING. It definitely changed my view of this place. I wouldn't mind coming back soon.",0.0

I have always enjoyed Highlands, but grew sick of the constant crowd, so ventured to its sister bar around the corner and was not disappointed.  I'd give the drinks 5 stars, always inventive and the cocktail selections are changed seasonally.  There's always something new to try.  The food is very good as well.  Whitehall never disappoints.",0.0
"The pizza here is really excellent. It serves as a very good substitute if the wait is too long, or if you get sick of the slightly better pizza, at Adrienne's nearby.

Much like Adrienne's, the best thing to get here is the Old-Fashioned Square Pie. They have most of the typical toppings you could want to load it up with. I usually like a nice meaty one, and they top it pretty well with adequate pepperoni and sausage. Some slices are lacking a bit sometimes, but overall it's pretty solid.

The other food here is pretty good as well. I've tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parm, which both provide for a satisfying meal.

I often order up from here, but the dine-in experience is good too. It's a nice, dark atmosphere with decent service. This is one of the few really good choices for both a nice meal out, or ordering in if you are in the Financial District.",0.0

"The first real coffee joint in K-Town. They use Sightglass beans from San Francisco for their espresso, and sell them as well. That makes this the only coffee place I know of in NYC that sells the best roasters I have so far come across in my life, though their own rendition is somewhat beset by very slight over-bitterness and lack of nuance, compared to SoMa's original. The space is very large and often delightfully available. Highly recommended, especially if you're sick of Stumptown three blocks down.
Open late for a coffee place. Hot dessert called Ho-dduk is like a real old-world fried donut filled with jam - very tasty.",0.0
This place is great it's open 24 7 and has great music...... service is fast and with a smile. I am never disappointed when I come here the guacamole and plaintain chips are my favorite thing to order. Big portions and it comes out on a huge beautiful white dishes. I would eat here all the time and never get sick of it. No wonder it's open 24 7 we need them to be. Great when you have been out all night with your friends and suddenly your starving and there is nothing that great to eat when you get home. If your in the area try it you won't be disappointed. It's packed all the time but what did you expect?!  You can take your food to go as well.,0.0
"For some funny reason, almost all my family and friends who visit me in NYC try the Kati Roll Company and then become freakishly obsessed with it. 

I can see why. It's delicious, reasonably priced, fast and has the comfort of simple, familiar Indian food. While flashier Indian cuisine like garlic naan and tiger prawns and butter chicken tend to steal the show at most places, us Indians have a strong appreciation for fresh roti/chapathi, flavorful paneer and some onions/pickle to top it off.

My favorite is the paneer tikka roll, but I've heard great things about the channa roll and the aloo roll. I've probably visited Kati Roll at least 10 times this summer with the influx of friends and family visiting, and I'm surprisingly not sick of it yet!",0.0
"Delicious. The original chicken fingers alone are the best I've ever had from a fast-food type joint. They're breaded just the right amount where you can still appreciate the chicken itself, which is so tender. 

I got the chocolate BBQ and buttermilk ranch sauces, and tried my friends' French onion sauce. All were great, but my personal favorite was the French onion.

I recommend getting more than one sauce - they're so rich that you could get sick of it. Plus it's fun to switch it up!",0.0
"I had high hopes with all the 4-5 star reviews for finding a good sushi place close to home, but alas I am still searching. Unfortunately the sushi quality was pretty disappointing, the decor too generic and the service a little too over eager.

We were seated right away and we took notice of the decor which is all dark browns and tiled surfaces. It looked very similar to other sushi places that have opened lately - thinking of Kaji on Franklin Ave in Garden City. Even the menus looked similar.

The service was very efficient - if anything it was too efficient with everything moving quite rapidly with dishes brought out quickly and taken away as soon as you remove the last bit of food off the plate. The pace made me a bit tense instead of relaxed. We were given a complimentary fried fish appetizer, which was nice. We also received a pineapple wedge upon paying the check. But even with the complimentary items and discount added unfortunately they couldn't over come the lack of flavor and quality of the sushi.

We ordered a Kani salad which came with tempura crunch flakes on top - I usually take this as a bad sign for whats to come. Unfortunately I was right.
We also ordered a sushi/sashimi combo (I like to get this the first time I come to a sushi place to gave a sample of the different fish they serve) and a tri-color sushi dinner. The plate came out with the sashimi arranged in a martini glass on a bed of julienne white radish and a led color changing light underneath. Is anyone else sick of this trend? The ""peacocking"" of your dinner plate - its ridiculous. Concentrate on using the best quality ingredients before all these ridiculous gimmicks. The fish itself was quite flavorless with the stiff texture of lesser quality cuts of fish also perhaps a bit too cold. 

This is a tough review to write when a place tries so hard, is very friendly (which they were) and it just doesn't come together. I am sure that the other reviews are genuine and many people like this type of sushi place, but for me it just doesn't work. Perhaps the specialty rolls that use eel sauce and spicy mayo will cover up the fish quality. I will keep looking for that elusive good quality sushi place on Long Island.",0.0
"Here is my latest restaurant review in Brown Girl Magazine for all the desi foodies out there!

Every New Yorker knows that you can only eat so many salads and sandwiches before you get sick of them. There are only so many options to grab-and-go for the busy, always-running-to-the-next-meeting, New Yorker. That's why easy to eat, portable food from other countries have become so popular in the Big Apple. One such example is the kati roll.

"Had my birthday dinner at this location and I had an absolutely wonderful time. This location is my favorite and it's super trendy. They had both inside and outside seating available... decided to sit inside because I like the ambiance.

Seated very quickly. Essentially no wait time; however, that changes during prime dining hours and sometimes the wait time can be lengthy but it is not too bad because there are stores around the area that you can visit to kill time. 

For dinner I ordered the traditional guacamole, which in my opinion is the best you can find in NYC. Also, their selection of drinks is extensive and fairly priced. Had their prickly pear margarita and that is a MUST HAVE. For my entree, try out the Mar y Tierra tacos, they are amazing. I noticed that they changed their plating on the dishes, and I prefer how they looked before, but the quality and taste of the food hasn't change. Our waitress was wonderful.. very attentive but not overbearing. She did a great job.

I definitely recommend Dos Caminos.. preferrably this location because I like the neighborhood. I could never get sick of this place!",0.0
"$5 for a giant slice of pizza. Tried their artichoke pizza and crab pizza. Both were really good!! I only got half a slice of artichoke and half a slice of crab pizza, but was getting sick of the flavor by the end of each my half slices. 

One person can probably comfortably eat one slice of pizza (yes, it's that big). But I would suggest getting two slices in diff flavors and sharing with someone so you don't get bored of the taste.",0.0
"Let me start with this disclaimer: Little Dirt Candy was my favorite restaurant ever.  So when Chef Amanda Cohen announced her opening for Big Dirt Candy I was so excited.  I set an alarm for 9am on February 3rd, when reservations would go live on Open Table.  I felt an obligation to go early and let them work out the kinks on a true believer.  I got a reservation for Friday.  It was a cold night in NYC and big DC has a comfortable bat area to wait for a table, this was the first improvement.  There were quite a few times that I showed up a bit early at little DC for a reservation and had to wait outside for my table.  The next thing that struck me was the gorgeous open kitchen.  It's bigger than the old restaurant.  Chef Amanda was prepping a Chocolate Onion tart near the bar and gave us a welcoming, familiar smile.  We chatted for a bit and she was off.  Once you had been to Little DC a few times you couldn't help but feel like you knew her a bit.  After all, she was probably taking your order,  bringing your food or pouring your wine, possible all three. The old favorite snack of jalapeño hush puppies is still available but the new addition of Korean Fried Broccoli sounded like a must, it was.  The broccoli was perfectly fried and I could have put away the whole bowl.  Do yourself a favor, get both snacks.  The appetizers were perfect.  The potato salad is great and I had a kale matzo ball from my wife's soup, I want a plate of them.  We shared the Brussel Sprout tacos which I loved.  Each ingredient come separate and you can build your own tacos.  Every combination is amazing.  For dessert my wife had the aforementioned chocolate Onion Tart and I had the Vegetable Ice Cream Salad.  The onion tart was quite good but the ice cream was amazing.  Each flavor was more wonderful than the previous one.  But the highlight of it was the walnut cake croutons and the golden beet ice cream, I could eat that everyday and never get sick of it.  
So when I said that Little Dirt Candy used to be my favorite restaurant, I wasn't saying that it no longer was because it had closed.  It's because Big Dirt Candy is my new favorite.  Congratulations Chef Amanda Cohen, and Thank You!",0.0
"The guy making the drink who wears pink or whatever doesn't have any manners. Treats his customers with disdain. When i informed him that my drink had sugar, he insisted on arguing and stating that he did not. I already tried it multiple times. Once i had a larger gulp of it, i could tell that the drink he gave me had large amounts of sugar in it. I finally ended up getting a smaller size cup than the one i paid for with no sugar. But by then i was already sick of this place. There are tons of boba places in flushing. It's customer service that matters. and this place has none.",0.0
Wonderful and friendly experience that I had here.  Such a calming environment and the frozen yogurt is a major plus!  I highly recommend going here.  It is defiantly  a place I will never get sick of.,0.0
"Stopped by here one night after a few drinks down the road at Long Island Bar.  The line at Colonie was too long and I was happy to try out a new place since our selection of good dining establishments are limited north of Atlantic Ave.  Good ole Brooklyn heights, the wasteland of good food.  Maybe it's my affluent neighbors that are of the older crowd of have families and don't care to go out for dinner.  But I'm sick of the same ole places that offer mediocre delivery that takes an hour. 

I stepped into Pair and loved everything.  We ordered a few items from each section to get a taste of everything.  Nothing disappointed.  How can you go wrong if you start with a good underlining of cheese.  The owner and I chatted about Greek wine and his love of affinage.  He even showed me his stash that he was aging after he got to know that I was a fellow affineur. 

At this point my friends were confused and lost interest haha, but if you're looking for a good albeit light dinner with good wine and atmosphere come stop by and try out the daily pairing at the bar and move on to dinner when you're done!",0.0

"Awesome place. 

Friendly staff, nice decor and ambience, great coffee, nice little healthy menu. 

Avo toast with egg was just delicious. Acai bowl a little strange, but definitely tasty and fresh. 

Would recommend to anyone who is in the area and sick of pancakes and syrup and muffins and the usual breakfast lark available in so many nameless faceless joints. 

Go and enjoy!",0.0
"Had dinner here last night and definitely plan on coming back. To start the ambience and mood is great. A very eclectic crowd and a relaxed but still upscale vibe comes across. Dimly lit and well layed out. You feel and taste the culture which is awesome compared to boring, stuffy NY restaurants. Now I can't stand mixed drinks, but I tried their Blood and Fire, and also had the honey wine and both were so good. We ordered the oxtail dumplings, crispy mushroom salad, fried okra, hibiscus ribs, and feijoada. Everything was really great. Alot of different,  uncommon spices and flavors which is appreciated if ur sick of the norm in NYC restaurants. This service is a little drawn out (slow) but I think it's because its the type of place where people sit for hours. Most groups were there before us and stayed after and we were there for 2 hours! I've only had dinner once before in Harlem, but The Cecil definitely sets the standard high. I'd prefer it over a majority of my midtown favorites. Can't wait to come back!",0.0
"Moved to this area a little over a year ago and was looking for a new breakfast/brunch spot (sick of the diner) n came across this cute n quaint place. This place has a very comfy, home like vibe. The staff was very friendly and attentive. They have a decent variety of choices on the menu. I think the majority of ppl around us ordered the traditional Irish breakfast. I got the breakfast burrito and my sis got banana walnut pancakes. We both enjoyed it and will be coming back again.",0.0
"I read the reviews about the oily buttery dishes. I went anyway and that was a mistake. Nausea and vomiting is not my idea of a satisfying meal. BUTTER? I think not. They used something other than that, possibly margarine or canola. The food was otherwise tasty. Won't be returning.",0.0
"This restaurant is stupid and will get sued soon if they don't change their practices.

I have a severe peanut allergy and am always very careful about it. I have an EpiPen and will go into anaphylactic shock if I eat peanuts. Now, I've had scallion pancakes about a million times from other restaurants, and they've never been served with peanut sauce, but if they were, I would expect at least a note under the item description (I ordered on GrubHub). There was no note so I assumed they didn't have peanuts. When I got the food, I saw the sauce and it looked different from the sauce that I've typically had with scallion pancakes, so I went to open it to try it with the scallion pancakes, and it (luckily) spilled all over me and the pancakes so the only part I could try was a tiny drop on my finger, rather than a full dip of the pancakes into the sauce.
After trying that tiny drop, I experienced hives, vomiting, a swollen-shut eye, and my lips swelled so much it felt like I had a marble implanted in my bottom lip. Had I not spilled the sauce, and tried a full portion, I would probably be dead or at the very least hospitalized. 
NOW, all of this could have easily been a misunderstanding--so I called, asking them to please label their items containing peanuts because I'm not the only person with an allergy and even I had an extremely troublesome experience. The woman seemed concerned until I told her I was fine, at which point she seemed to disregard me, sounding confused about why I even called. There was no apology, no refund offered, literally nothing. I then called GrubHub because it was obvious that she wasn't going to do anything, and they said they would label the scallion pancakes as being served with peanut sauce. They then called the restaurant and tried to get me a refund. I didn't ask for any monetary compensation, but GrubHub understands customer service, and the fact that I had to throw away my meal because I couldn't eat it because they didn't advertise the presence of allergens was entirely the restaurant's fault. The restaurant refused to give me a refund.
Long story short, if you have a nut allergy, don't eat here. If you want any kind of customer service, also don't eat here. Maybe just don't eat here if you're human.",0.0
"Easily the worst meal I've had on the island in 35 years.  Their tomato sauce is horrible.  We got it on ravioli and it tasted like they just opened a can of tomato sauce added no spices or salt and served it.  Then with the fried calamari I got ""fra diavlo"" sauce which was the same exact tomato sauce,  this time with Tabasco sauce... again with no flavor at all. I took my calamari home and I'll open a jar of Rao's fra diavlo sauce. My daughter had linguine with clan sauce which she didn't eat also because she said it tasted like it came out of a jar... I want even that lucky. 
I honestly don't understand how everyone has not had the same reaction,  unless the chef was replaced or sick. Waste of $100.",0.0
"I'm so sick of places like this that don't even bother to try. 

My friends were catching a bus back to DC right outside of this restaurant, so I joined them for a quick drink and bite to eat. 

The beer list was boring, but they did have a seasonal on tap (Sam Adams Octoberfest) so I got that. We also ordered some pricey apps -- chicken fingers, jalapeno poppers, and sliders. I didn't eat any of the sliders but tried the fingers and poppers. The poppers were incredibly hot, but it was the wrong kind of hot (caliente, not at all picante) and they came with some sad, flavorless white sauce that was probably cream cheese but could've been anything, really. The chicken was okay and was served with honey mustard.

Our server was nice enough, I suppose. The five of us were all given full menus but we had to ask for a second drinks/apps menu, even though they knew that's all we were there for. The ambiance was nonexistent but at least the restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.

Sorry that this review isn't very inspired... but I tend to draw inspiration from delicious and/or interesting food and drink selections.",0.0
"This place is a total fucking joke. I placed an order on their website, NOT seamless. I received a confirmation email from them that my order was placed. After an hour of waiting, I called to check on my order. I called them more than 5 times and each time after a few rings a fax machine noise would come on. I have screen shots of both how many times I called and of my confirmation order. After the 7th time calling, a girl answered. When I asked that I was checking the status of my order(since it's been over an hour) all she said was that a bunch of orders had just went out. She didn't ask me what my name or what my order was. I then called back again when another 30 minutes went by. I stated that I had already called about my order. This was when the girl asked me for my name and order. She said she never received my order that I placed on their website. She said she ""doesn't know how it works."" ""Must be a glitch in the system."" Ummm what?! Oh and now they are closing. Never again. What a fucking waste of time. I'm home sick and I'm starving.",0.0
"""It's like they have all this food and stuff, and no idea what to do with it"" my friends exact words. It seemed like they just opened the dam place.

Although we were the FIRST to order, it took, what felt like forever, to get our food. Yes, i was keeping track of time but stopped after the 15 minute mark (it was just making me angry). What's worse, the place was unbelievably hot inside. No AC on or anything [EDIT] - I went here in the middle of august btw..

The people helping us were slow and lethargic. It was extremely annoying.
Walking back to work angry, I was hoping the food was going to be delicious. Yep, I was wrong.

My Italian Panini bread was soggy, the chicken was gross (could not even bite through on piece), and the pepper and pesto had little flavor. My onion rings look like the ones you get at a supermarket (because they were).

Wait, the PRICE! Will this place be redeemed??! .... No, everything i got was around $12. I could get a lot more for a lot less.

So why the two (instead of one)? I was fed. I didn't get sick, and i didn't see roaches. So i guess you can say i met my goal of eating successfully. 

Don't go here.",0.0
"Went to this place as consolation for the wifey after making the trek to SOHO and  discovering that the new Kate Spade Saturday store a couple doors down was still under construction.

The cafe is in a touristy part of Manhattan so the odds are that you wont specifically go to Spring street unless you're a tourist or work there.

We didn't have as bad an experience as the prior reviewers but it's not stellar.

Service - Was greeted and seated immediately upon entering. Service is basic but cordial. We got the items we asked for shortly after ordering. It's NYC with people of varying linguistic abilities so don't expect the wait staff to be overly chatty like at a down home diner. 

Ambience - The decor is charming in its own way. The walls are painted with the Mediterranean dry sponge treatment that was all the rage some years ago. I'd want to shoot a scene here if I was an indie no budget guerilla movie maker. 

Food - The coffee was ok and the food is ok but we didnt order anything fancy. Their interpretation of cannoli has a firmer filling than what I expected ricotta to be like. It's was almost like hard cream cheese. The slice of orange peel gives it a nice tang.  I gotta say it, the cannoli from Rizzo's pizza delivery in Astoria tastes better  We didn't get sick nor feel any negative after effects so that's definitely a plus in the cafe's favor.

It was a Monday afternoon and there were at most three other tables that were occupied. We were there for an hour but did not feel any pressure from the wait staff to either order more or to eat and go. Oddly though, the waiter decided to automatically tack on an 18% gratuity to the bill. I did not find their SSID and did not bother to ask if there was wifi as I was using my AT&T mobile.

Restrooms in NYC are difficult to find so any available facility is good and deserves mention. This one has character and it's better than restrooms at a rock concert.

"So, I'll start by saying that the service is terrible here. You have to enter Casa Mezcal with lower than average expectations in this regard. We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night and were told that it would be a 45 minute wait. No worries - we expected that. The hostess took my phone number, told me she would text me when our table was ready and pointed us in the direction of the suuuper cool bar that just opened downstairs (I'll get to that later). One hour later, my boyfriend went to check on our reservation. When he told her our name and explained to her that she took my number, she looked at him stupefied and told him that she didn't remember that happening......um........

Thankfully, we were a few delicious spicy margaritas deep at that point, so we didn't mind too much when they seated us 15 minutes later at a small bar counter against the kitchen. Rewind to the part where we had a few drinks downstairs in Casa Mezcal's new bar. SO awesome. Dim lighting, attentive bartenders and a cool, loungey vibe. Highly recommend the spicy margarita. 

When we finally got to our (bar counter) table, we ordered the chips & guacamole and the chicken tamales. Both were amazing. I definitely want to go back to try the enchiladas as those also looked delicious. Thank God for the sick new bar and good food / drinks combo....it made us forget about the poor service.",0.0
"Just had lunch here today after coworkers had been bragging about it for weeks as the best cheap sushi in manhattan.

But really, does one really want to combine the word cheap with raw fish? Ramen I can understand as all that steamy broth kills the deadly microbes. But i dunno, New York. I guess we all live knowing we're a short ambulance ride from the ER and so we live dangerously.

That said the waitress was cool. I ordered a la carte and asked her if I ordered properly. She said' ""Yes, better than my boyfriend"" and we both laughed. 

The food came. Everything tasted fresh but they serve the fish in pieces that are way too large (Americanized?) I hate that. 

Miso soup was delicious. As I finished my last slurp behold, a cockroach hiking over my chopstick wrapper. :(

"It's $11 a pound for the desserts. They're all mini size and I actually like the idea of it because that way you don't get sick of the desserts. 

Salted Caramel Bite: I didn't really like it. I didn't really tasted the salted caramel, just tasted brownie and chocolate.

Slutty Brownie Bite: It lived up to my expectation. You could taste the brownie, oreo, and cookie. 

Red Velvet Whoopie: I like the whoppie pie, the cream cheese (if that's what they use for  frosting) wasn't overwhelming at all.

White Chocolate Rainbow: I like and don't like it at the same time. I'm not really a fan of the filling in between the cakes but it didn't taste bad.

Chocolate Chip Sandwich: I like this cookie sandwich, full of chocolate chips and wasn't too chocolately. 

Raspberry Coconut Square: It doesn't really have the raspberry flavor but definitely the coconut. 

Watermelon Lemonade: I wasn't sure of what to expect from this drink, just that it will probably be really sour. But I was wrong, it tasted like watermelon juice with a hint of lemonade. I definitely like this drink.

I definitely plan on coming back and trying the other different desserts they have to offer, they all look so good!",0.0

"This spot is NYC's PREMIER TATER TOT CLUB.

Most good NYC nightclubs will charge you at least a grand for table service. But I was able to score a table at American Retro for FREE. So sick. 

At first I was pissed that they didn't offer (traditional) bottle service. But after I threw a bit of a fit, the manager explained to me that we COULD get bottle service - just that the bartender would have to serve it to me and my bros one drink at a time. Seemed like a pretty tight idea. Wonder if more places will start doing that? 

Sickest of all, Retro (unlike every other premier NYC nightclub I've been to - and I've been to A LOT of premier NYC nightclubs because I'm a wealthy businessman/sex addict) offers a wide variety of tot-based dishes. My boy J-Dubb got an order of ""Pizza Tots"" - an Italian take on the grated-and-fried potato dish. I went with the ""Tot-chos"" - Mexican-style tater tots. Long story short, I don't see myself ever going to another nightclub that doesn't offer tots. 

OTHER REASONS RETRO IS NYC'S HOTTEST TOT CLUB 
- Conveniently located next to a Mobil gas station 
- Also down the street from Larry Flint's Hustler Club - which doesn't serve tots despite the pricey cover
- Retro has this dope robot-DJ that will play whatever song you want in exchange for a dollar.
- There's not a ton of room to dance, so me and J-Dubb just played skee ball and split ""Disco Tots"" instead.",0.0
"I have been coming to this restaurant for close to ten years now, and I never love it any less.  When I dream about vegetarian food, or even Chinese food, this is the place I'm picturing. 

The menu never ends - pages and pages of delicious, creative, flavorful vegetarian options.  They even have specials every now and then, as if the heavy THUD of the menu hitting the table doesn't suggest that there are already enough choices. 

What I get every time is the lemon chicken.  It could be a desert.  It's crunch on the outside, soft on the inside, and full of lemony amazingness (I'm pretty sure it's made of yam). 

My dining partner and I also shared a few other things - a mock pork dish and an eggplant dish - and neither disappointed.  Their steamed dumplings are also fantastic. 

I would come to this place daily if I didn't live so far away.  And why not?  It's so cheap! 

A few years ago I came here on my own, with a book, after not having come for a long time.  I ordered an appetizer and two entrees and took my time, reading, and ate it all.  I was disgusted by myself, but enamored with the food.  And, no one rushed me!

"I came here with my mom and sister yesterday after exploring china town. My mom and I are both sick and wanted some hot and sour soup so we decided to choose this place. Reasons why I don't recommend this place:

1. The man who took down our order wasn't very friendly and we got the impression that he didn't like us just ordering soup. 

2. When we received our soup it wasn't even piping hot. More like lukewarm. 

3. A lady brought us our bill and was also very rude. 

4. When it was time to leave tip the guy was literally standing on my face to see how much I was leaving. 

5. A a we left there was a different lady near the entrance picking her nose. She was all up in there doing some excavating.

Came here one random night with my friends. There were only 4 of us so we were able to get a room. The room was fairly small. The air conditioner didn't seem like it was working well and the screen to type the songs were a little difficult. I wasn't able to delete the duplicates so that took some time to and it froze sometimes too. When the guy gave us the microphones they were extremely sticky!!!! I honestly wish I has alcohol wipes because it was extremely disgusting. The lady from the bar came to our room once to ask of we wanted a bottle and we said to give us 10 minutes.... the girl never came back! The price for karaoke was 8 a person per hour so we paid about 20 each.  We had a good time however we wish it was more clean especially at this time where people are getting sick!,0.0
"As someone who has been going here on a regular basis for the last 6 months and once a huge fan of this place I've never been more disappointed in a restaurant like this in a long time. There was not only one, not two, but three mix ups in the course of the 30 minutes we were there this afternoon. Two had to do with the order which i recommend all places write things down and repeat it back to the customer which this place does not do. The third mistake was not forgiving in my book. We asked for the fried chicken which was mixed up in the order already and came out 15 minutes later but it came out pink and rare inside. The chef instead of apologizing had an attitude about it and was not apologetic whatsoever. It was pink to the point where one would have definitely contracted ecoli. It was frightening and more so upsetting that they didn't really care. So sad to see one of my formerly favorite places no longer being a consideration for places to dine anymore. I hope they take this feedback and try to improve so that in the future people don't have my same issue and even worse get really sick and ill from mishandling of the food. So so so sad.",0.0
"As much as I love the concept of Just Salad, this location has continued to go downhill.  It seems like the staff doesn't care about anything.  When I've been there - both my last visit, and the visit prior (which was a few months ago), tables were dirty, and while there was no line they were understaffed enough where there was one person working the entire saladmaking process (ingredients and chopped/dressings).  The bathrooms had no paper towers - felt dirty, and no one seemed to be keeping them up.  One person on register who gave me literally two seconds of her time, to then go back to chatting with the other staff.  

I kept wondering if the food was fresh, and if I was going to get sick after I finished my meal.  Thankfully, that didn't happen.

Again, I don't think most locations are like this, but this one is becoming stale and needs some improvements. Next time, I won't go back to this location, would try pretty much anywhere else instead.",0.0
"This place is garbage. Like, legitimately. I visited today after work, and there was hair in my food. Disgusting. It was in the Orange chicken- for those of you who like that stuff.

When I told the manager, she didn't seem surprised or to even care. And rather than throwing the Orange chicken out, they kept serving it to people. SICK. 

The employee serving the food had an attitude, snatched my card, and almost got her head handed to her on a tray. In addition, half the trays were empty, and it was just an overAll terrible experience. 

If it's this place versus neighboring Sarku, I'd recommend Sarku... You can see it being made there. And the only rude employee is the chick at the register.",0.0
"I was craving fries and remembered how good the smash fries were. I could not think anything else.
It was 4 pm and I did not have lunch yet. I was so hungry going crazy so maybe this review is not so relevant to the regular lunch hour for the people who have normal appetite.

It was around 4, so there were only two people waiting in front of me. It took 8 minutes to get my turn. The cashier was busy talking to her colleague who is on his break. I was dying from hunger at this point.

It did not take longer than 5 minutes get my order tough. But... the fries were swimming in the oil... I tried to wipe it off and used up all the napkins on the table. Also, they were just room temp warm and very dry....

Who complains about that?! It's only $1 you shouldn't expect much. Live a little and spend the extra $2 to get some flavor. The service was great.

"Some of the best food I've had in NYC to date.

We loved the ""appetizer style"" eating, because this solves the ""massive portion"" problem where you may love what you're eating but you just get sick of eating so much of the SAME THING. There were 3 of us--me, my fiance, and his sister--and so we all ordered a different dish for each of the three courses and shared.

Everything was truly amazing, but the dishes that stood out were 1) octopus (insanely tender), 2) skate (somehow more delicious than the lobster that accompanied it), and 3) campanelle (I have never eaten a tastier mushroom than the morel mushrooms that were integrated into this dish).

Also, the service was outstanding. The sommelier's recommendations for what we wanted were spot-on and he didn't pressure us to choose anything pricier than we had already chosen.

"Ugh! Fresh&Co made me so sick! I was working on my final papers for graduate school two years ago. I went to grab something to eat. I was being extra careful about my gluten-free diet specifically because I didn't want to get sick during finals. I spoke with the staff about my gluten allergy and they helped me find something that was ""gluten-free"". I was excited by how welcoming and understanding they were. They seemed to really understand what a gluten allergy is. I got back to the library and to my paper. A few bites into my meal I started getting extremely sleepy and swelling up all over. I had to run for my allergy medicine, drink lots of water, and sleep off my allergic reaction. This was not something I needed during finals! I lost time that I was planning on using to get my work done. If my allergy was worse, I could have ended up in the hospital.

"Never really tried any Greek despite living in Astoria for the past 2 years. I'm a vegetarian and most menus I've perused don't seem very veg friendly. However, I was home, I was starving and realized I had a halloumi craving, enter GrubHub/Yelp investigation which led me to E Taverna. Shockingly it's only two blocks away from my apartment. I sat at a small corner table. The restaurant has a cozy, rustic feel. I ordered the horta, halloumi, and fries potatoes. The horta came lightning fast, and was kinda lukewarm, which didn't bother me too much, but the dish had a ton of olive oil and that's all I could taste. Potatoes were good, came shortly. I waited far longer for the halloumi. I found the house red unpalatable.

Second encounter was a few months later. I was feeling sick of Thai and was again craving halloumi. I ordered the tzatziki as well. The tzatziki was delicious. The halloumi was inedible. Although nicely grilled they added no lemon and acid is essential with a fried cheese dish. But worse than that it must have been stored improperly or was old. It tasted like the inside of walk in.

"After reading an article in NYT and a place on Eater's ""hottest restaurants in Manhattan August 2015"", I was excited to try Pecora. 

Its pretty clear that the owner paid for said articles to be written because this place is extremely underwhelming.

The pasta could not be handmade: maybe once upon a time before it made it's way into a box. The Maccheroni actually tasted gluten-free. We didn't even finish it and we were really hungry.'

The Misto was fine, albeit stale bread.

Lastly, everything we ordered seemed to sit in a pool of (pretty nice) olive oil.  The best of our dishes--the Crostino, a piece of toast with 'nduja and ricotta--sat in a serious pool of (nice, but far too much) olive oil. It made us both a little sick. 

We mistakenly ordered a bottle of wine which we are now brooding over as I write this review from the kitchen where I am watching what looks like a train wreck with the exec chef yelling at his crew in front of guests. I get this is the name of the game but maybe not in an open kitchen of a new restaurant still working out quirks. 

I cannot believe I'm about to pay $140 for some cheese, boxed pasta and mediocre wine. 

Prove that the hype is real and that you're not just trying to confuse Japanese tourist overflow from Eataly. Or go home.

"This establishment does not deserve one star.  It truly deserves zero stars!  One Tuesday, my coworker and I stopped by here to get sundaes. There is a promotion going on which us buy one sundae and you get one free. This new worker totally screwed up my order. I specifically said I wanted two scoops of ice cream and pointed to the cup and he still got it wrong. He was also cheap with the tops.  We go to heated of explaining  ourselves to we just left. Oh and as we were there a man with his kids came in to yell at him because he bought a sundae and didn't get another sundae. Then this idiot worker proceeds to hand him this small cup with some old purple ice cream in the cup that was already in the ice cream case. It looked like someone ordered the ice cream and change their mind and these idiots decided to leave it in the ice cream case to serve someone else. I'm all about saving money but that's just GROSS!!!!!  Stay away from this store or you might end up sick!!",0.0
"I stumbled upon this place with my friend last weekend, it I must say, fate was kind that day.  We were sick of waiting in line for another brunch, so we checked this place out instead.  There was no wait, an unlimited drinks deal, and an awesome ambiance.  It felt like we were eating in some kind of bazaar.

The food took a bit of time to reach the table, but the taste more than made up for it.  We split the Breakfast Pizza and the Herbed Eggs.  Both entrees were incredibly flavorful and unique.  Both of us were talking about the meal for the rest of the weekend!  For a relaxed, quiet, fantastic meal, definitely keep this place on your radar.",0.0
"Loud sticky bar with 10 screens blasting football games. (It was a Sunday). 
There was no room to stand downstairs near the bar so we walked upstairs to a ledge next to the control room. 
Yes I like football but I hate unable to converse with people about the game. 
Or converse at all. 
The games are blasting, pop songs are blasting on top of that and half eaten food baskets and half finished dixie cups lie around, filled with Miller or Bud. We ordered a pitcher for $5 (What a deal!) but it tasted like 80% water and 20% swill so I gave up. I would advise you not to drink a Guinness on tap (from another location) and drink Off the Wagon pitchers. Not a great idea. 

This bar made me feel old and crotchety. We got sick of not being able to hear one another, so we all left in search of a better place.",0.0

"I stopped by here on my last visit to the city. We were visiting family and they took us here to try the pickle back shots. Apparently they are all the rage in NYC right now. Maybe elsewhere too.

So we had four shots of Tullamore Dew irish whiskey and four shots of pickle juice. You chase the whiskey with the pickle juice. It's supposed to be amazingly delicious or something. And everyone seemed to like it, that is, except for me. As soon as I took the pickle chaser, I immediately felt sick to my stomach and wanted to vomit. I then started having the ""about to vomit"" feeling. Awesome bartender comes over and asks me if i wanted some water to which I nodded and served up a refreshing, ice water with lemon instantly which allowed me to get over my nausea and continue with my day. If it weren't for the timing of that water, it would have been a disaster. Be on notice though, that pickle juice can have some serious effects. It came back to haunt me later that night, but was quelled with a delicious sandwich. 

The decor ambiance was cool. i would totally hang out there. And the service was clutch. The bathroom has a ton of stickers everywhere, and while I would prefer not to have to do a number two there, there would be a lot of interesting things to read while visiting. I don't make it to NYC that often, and when I do, I don't usually make it to the lower east side, so i don't know how long it'll be before I return. but if i lived in the city and especially in the neighborhood, I'd be back often, Great selection of booze too.",0.0
"Kim Ga Nae is one of those rare Korean places where the food is actually cheap. My stomach size may not be too big but I always have room for Korean food. Very convenient. Kim Ga Nae is placed right by the heart of Main St. on Union and Roosevelt. The service inside is really on par. I wish all restaurants had similar service then I wouldn't have to worry about a bad experience. 

The three dishes that I absolutely love is:
The Pork Katsu -- OMGOSH -- It doesn't get better.
The Bulgogi -- Super filling
The Kim Chi Fried rice -- Can't ever get sick of rice.

I've also been to Korea and I feel like this place really resembles a lot with their service. Also they provide unlimited rice and soup just like in Korea as well. I really like this place a lot and there's still so much I have yet to try out.

"I was born in the Philippines, but don't really know too much about the culture and the food ... I was so excited that my Filipina friend decided to bring me here. 

The staff were really helpful in terms of explaining each dishes, what was popular and most recommended. Since we ate prior to coming here, my friend and I decided to share the Pampangan Style Sizziling Sisig that came with the garlic rice. So fattening yet it was really good. As for the drink, I obviously went for the Pacquiao's Punch - very gingery ... I know where I'm coming back to now if I was ever sick and needed a drink.

"Our party of four (parents who winter in southern PRC/HK, me, & my husband with a sharp and super-adventurous palate) were seated quickly. This place is roomy and offers good views of all the food coming and going. And all the food looks great. But two big things: 1) 80% of the dim sum items are severely lacking in flavor. The exceptions are the phung zhao/chicken feet and the char siu sow(sp?), both decent but not great. Everything else we had was bland and under seasoned. The textures are right on the money but who cares when there's no flavor. Oh, wait...2) everything featuring whole shrimp (like har gao & har cheung, STAPLES of any dim sum meal) had a terrible texture AND needed seasoning. The shrimp were tough, mealy, and dense. Over cooked or some weird kitchen shortcut (using pre-cooked shrimp?) or poor quality shrimp or all of the above? I don't know why the shrimp were so tasteless and hard but it ruined the har gao, usually a barometer of a dim sum kitchen's skill.

Oh and also, half the staff we encountered were resentful of any questions/comments and just so sick of life in general they could not be bothered to respond to ""Are any of those fried item still warm/hot?"" or ""More tea, please"" and would simply turn and walk away in the middle of an interaction.  This does not matter to me if the food is good.  Which it is not here.

We were seated with a great view of the ovens and my hawk-eyed dad spied egg custard tarts coming fresh out of the oven and walked straight up there and snagged an order. Such flaky pastry crusts so crisp and hot from the oven surrounding a creamy but completely disappointing and flavorless custard. And this is as fresh and good as you can get an item!

All in all, nothing was inedible but nothing there gives us any reason to return either.",0.0
"This place is alright I guess.  Our appetizer was good, scallops.  My husbands entree was good, but we paid an eztra 10 dollars for literally two bites of lobster to come in the pasta.  My entree almost made me sick.  I ordered the venison, which was a 34 dollar dish, opretty expensive even for NYC.  I ordered it cooked the way they recommended it, medium rare.  I am pretty open minded about how well done my food is, but this was just gross.  I trimmed off the outer 1/8 of an inch of meat, the only part that seemed edible, and I ate that.  It was cold in the middle.  Anyways, that being said, it wasn't a horrible meal, just be careful if you order this medium rare. In retrospect I could have sent it back to have them throw it back on the grill for a few minutes. But oh well.  Another thing that bugged me was my wine.  I only got MAYBE 2/3 of a pour.  Perhaps if someone else in my party wants desparately to go here, I would return, otherwise NYC has way too many incredible restaurants to waste another 135 dollars.",0.0
"Are you sick of waiting hours just to eat ramen?  I don't know about you but waiting 1 to 3 hours to eat ramen is insane...   I'll let you in on a little secret... Walk a block and avenue down to 51st and 10th and get yourself what you desire with no wait at all... 
.  
Yes! the wait is a lot shorter (15min or less) than the one located on 52nd and 9th; and it is NYC best ramen joint.  Yes! better than Ippudo.  

Totto Ramen... the way ramen its supposed to be made.  Their broth is silkyl smooth and  less heavy; cleaner tasting than the pork based broth.  The noodles are always aldente and fresh.  The ramen to get is Totto Extra Spicy Ramen and a Totto Miso Ramen, and both were lovely.. The extra spicy ramen had rayu and spicy sesame oil to the soup, and the result was dark, nutty, and warming, if a little heavy on black pepper.  The noodles came topped with scallion, char siu pork, bean sprouts, and nori.  This was a winning combination - the char siu was meaty and took well to a soak in the broth.  The miso ramen was just as good, with a big scoop of Koji miso and ground pork sitting on top of the noodles.  It came with the same char siu, scallion, and bean sprouts, along with some thin slices of onion and half of a seasoned hardboiled egg.  

We enjoyed every last noodle.  The broth was spectacular.  Hands-down the best ramen in NYC.  Stuffed myself silly..

"I placed a delivery item tonight.  I wish I had eaten cold cereal instead.  First of all, the food was delivered over an hour after ordering.  That is the least of the problems.  Now, lets talk about the food.

I ordered three different rolls.  All three rolls arrived with the same bright orange chewed up fish.  it was either on top of the roll, or inside of the roll.  It was like someone had gathered all of the leftover fish, threw in some orange dye, and gave it a big whirl in the food processor.  Nasty and not found in nature. 

The vegetable tempura was the least objectionable food item.  Veggies, deep fried in a thick, chunky paste of batter.  Way too much batter.

I guess thats how it is like in Jamaica. I never been to Jamaica and have no way to compare. But I have to say the chicken was a bit dry. Brown sauce chicken looks mouth watering but not flavorful. Maybe its just me. Same with the fish. I think they probably just baked the chicken and fish then poured the sauce on top. None of the sauce or broth got into the chicken or fish. Although I have to say rice and beans was good. Same with the collard green, roast beef and plantain. Friend said I must be sick because I dont like bananas but this one looked just tasty.

"Can't recommend them for delivery anymore. Tasty food, for sure--though don't eat this often or you'll really pack on the pounds. But it's been over an hour since I put in my order (and it's EARLY).

"Just... Whoa! Don't know where to begin but this place is going to be a hot spot in the coming year. I'd get in while you can. 

The small plates are incredible. Hands down the best mussels I've had in the city. That chorizo oil paired with the tomato confit really compliment the soft textured, perfectly prepared mussels. Encore!

Also had bites of my friends' charred octopus (super super super tender) & Kobe beef sliders. Nothing but simple and perfect flavor profiles. Must have. These meats are excellently prepared and really are the star of the show... So tired of over prepared dishes... Z Bar's chefs just let the simple flavors shine!

Girlfriend got the Peasant Mini Paella and it knocked us out. Mushroom risotto, confit of hen, duck chorizo, fava beans, and pancetta all snuck in? There's so many things going on in this dish and I have to say, it works perfectly! Perfect for a winter night when you need some of that stick to your bones cuisine.

We shared the Midtown Salad - CRISPY POACHED EGG???! I could eat a basket of those. Can't describe the flavor and texture, you just have to try it.

Seared Chilean Seabass & Roasted Organic Chicken were the mains. That Seabass is baaaaaaaad. It was seared so well and the creamy, moist texture of the fish was left in tact. Melted away in each bite. Need to get the recipe for that asparagus risotto... I love asparagus and the preparation there is just spot on.

That chicken... Man, I know I'm blowing smoke at this point but you have to try it. Again, that sear. There was such a nice golden skin on the most perfect juicy chicken you've ever had. Pure flavor paired with this decadent farro risotto to really contrast the lean chicken. Tad salty, but I dig salt. 

Anyways, now I'm fully hungry, sick and tired of trying to emulate their prep on the chicken dish, and planning my return to Z Bar. Lobster Mac & Cheese? That will definitely be on my plate next visit!",0.0

"Ahhh this place was awful. We had an 8 hour break between flights, we were going to go out of the airport to get something to eat but a lady that worked in the terminal told us that this place would be better...we trusted her enough to not bother checking reviews first..that was a mistake. We sat there for about twenty minutes before anyone came to take our drink orders or even bring water, finally a waiter came and took our drink order, then he disappeared for half an hour. Eventually he came back with our drinks and the coffee cups were only half full, when we asked him to fill them up all the way he walked off for another ten minutes before coming back. After about an hour of sitting there, we had to call over another waiter to come take our order for food. Eventually (most) of us got our food, and it was disgusting! Two of us had to wait another twenty minutes before getting their orders. Not only was it bad, it was really expensive. $18 for some nasty chicken and waffles?? It was an eggy, gross waffle with a small piece of chicken on top! It made me feel sick. We then had to go back to waiting for the waiter to bring us a check, getting the check and paying took another 30-40 minutes. Everyone around our table was complaining about the same things too, awful service and bad food.",0.0
"Hangawi was a disappointment. Although at first when we walked in I was very impressed with the ambiance-- mood lighting, low tables, and cushions on the floor. I was amused they asked us to take off our shoes. But then it went downhill from there. The waitress had a cold/cough and was having a fit when she came for our orders. I know it's not her fault she was sick, but management should have let her stay home. When we ordered, we said someone in our party was allergic to mushrooms. So we asked her what she recommended and that took a long while because almost all of their sauces included mushrooms. Finally we settled for the Fritters Appetizer, then the Stone Bowl Bimbimbap, Tofu with Brocolli, and Tofu Steak. She came back later and said they were out of Tofu Steak. By then I just wanted to leave. But we stayed and ordered a subsitute. Then our drinks came-- three very watered down soju. Soju is supposed to be 20% alcohol but our drinks tasted like juice. Then I needed to use the restroom. Now remember we were barefoot as they had asked us to take off our shoes. At the restroom entrance were two sets of rubber slippers.  I don't know if those slippers are ever cleaned, but all I can think of are foot/skin diseases that previous wearers had. How can they expect us to put our feet in footwear that were worn by 50 other strangers--- what is this, a bowling alley? Anyway, the food was just okay. Bland. It did not taste like authentic Korean food. And finally after a $130 bill, we left very disappointed and unsatisfied. Not going back.",0.0

"This supermarket went from 7 or so aisles to 7 aisles + a cramped up produce section  + half of an entire corner sidewalk! WHAT THE! 
Why do I need to go outside to get my soda or my chips? Wait, do you want me to get pick them up on the way in? Every time I walk into this market the scenery of how the outside of it is set up ruins it all for me. First of all, I almost went heads on into the woman walking towards me because neither of us had enough space on the sidewalk, why is the supermarket taking up half of what belongs to pedestrians?

Why are the Sodas outside? I don't think the summer heat can do any good to the carbonated drinks nor do any good for ones health if one were to purchase any steamily hot beverage from there and then insert it in a nice cold fridge, what a drastic change in temperature! 

Finally, I make it inside- I DO like that the produce section is set up as soon as I get in... it makes it easier for me to avoid the rest of this supermarkets congestion. However lets not go without saying that you can spend about an 1 hour getting around the maze of produce, mostly because of the way it is setup and at every corner  of this maze someone is standing blocking the way to the delicious broccoli or apples. EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME! 

After finally making it out of this claustrophobic maze, the deli section has set up a nice ""pay for every pound fresh meal every day"" kind of thing. They have a great selection of salads, meats, chicken, soups-- its pretty delicious. I actually am on a gluten free diet and have been able to eat a few things from here without getting sick!
 
After getting pass the deli area, another journey to find everything else I need. 
Where is the cereal? Where is the pet food? Why is the bread so far away from the peanut butter and jelly? You don't have gluten free bread????!! Why did I come to this aisle? I just wasted 5 mins. 
Why do you not have more gluten free options? 
Why isn't the milk near the cheese and yogurt section? 
Do you have Juice? or is that outside too? 

I do like that this supermarket has a variety of international products that are difficult to find in other supermarkets, but which Aisle is that in? near the bread?

I just don't understand the intended lay out. What do I get out of having international products here, if i have no idea where it is? Or if one week its in aisle one and the next its outside!

Well, after the strenuous journey of stocking up on what I was able to find, I make my way over to the register. 
TWO open registers. two LONG lines. WHY? 
Im not here to spend most of my day. I just want to pay and go! Am I really going to wait on this line? 

I guess I should since I already went through the hassle of getting all my things. 
wait. Wait. WAIT.WAIT. 4mins. 6 mins.
HOLD on the cashier forgot to give back the customer her change, she needs the key. MORE WAITING. MORE WAITING. 
Cashier doesn't know that the cheese that says 3.99 is NOT 5.79. she needs the manager. MORE WAITING. 11 mins.

UGH. okay finally I'm up. WOW. the cashier can't be any slower! Is this your first time on the job? Why do you look so miserable? okay, hurry up I want to get out!

I see the sun and i am finally out the door! As I walk pass the supermarket, I wave goodbye and feel a sign of relief. Until I realize I forgot to buy my chips! 

Do I want to go back in? NO! 
I will just come back tomorrow. or maybe hit up the other two supermarkets nearby. 

I guess nothing really can be done about the congestion here, seeing as Astoria is getting pretty populated--however this place needs new management  maybe the cashiers will work faster and have my chips and soda INSIDE the store. I have never seen food outside of a supermarket? This is just too weird to me.
I bought soda here once and it wasn't carbonated and the chips were stale- I'm sure due to conditions of the weather outside.

"This is the one of the few places in NYC that offers rooftop lunch.  So for that, it deserves a couple of stars.  

Unfortunately the lunch itself was pretty bland.  I had the chicken, my bf had the steak sandwich.  Both were just tasteless.

"The food at Zen 6 is pretty good and had good prices. We had fried rice, kara age, ramen burger and ramen. Fried rice and Kara Age was delicious and would order that again. It was my first time trying the ramen burger but I didn't have high expectations for it. However, I was impressed! Flavorful and juicy. It's a bit messy to eat though. The ramen was good but nothing special.

Our group sat near the front and the waitress kept bumping into my chair every time she walked past me. I kept pushing my chair further in but she kept bumping into me. It wasnt hard but it was enough that it bothered me. However I think that this was just due to the layout of the tables and not the waitress' intention. She was actually pretty nice.

Another waitress who took our order encouraged us to check in to get the free dessert (a green tea red bean popsicle). A couple of us did and got our dessert. My friend who didn't check in changed his mind and wanted to get dessert too. However his phone didn't let him check for some reason and the waitress wouldn't give him the dessert. We paid our check and was about to leave when my friend finally got his check in to work. He asked the waitress again if he could get the popsicle and she told him to wait. At this moment her demeanor changed. She made us wait near the front of the restaurant for 5-10 minutes. Then she walked right through my friends, basically pushing them to the side. She goes outside and then down into the storage area. She takes out a box of the dessert, opens it and gives one to my friend. Then she goes back without saying anything.

My friend got a stomach ache afterwards and swears she cursed him with diarrhea. It was pretty funny but hopefully not true. 

Bottom line - good service if you're an easy customer. But don't expect the waitresses to still be nice to you if you're going to be difficult.",0.0
"When my employer's office moved to a new location I was happy to see a healthy looking place to eat just around the corner. My very first visit was a little confusing. I wasn't sure where to stand but a nice employee explained the process. 

I ordered the Roasted Chicken Pesto sandwich (completely forgetting that garlic is an ingredient in pesto which is bad for me because I have Laryngopharyngeal Reflux--more on this later). I was kicking myself when I realized garlic was in the pesto but ate the sandwich anyway. I'm currently keeping a food journal and experimenting to see what I can/cannot handle so I considered eating the pesto sandwich an experiment. I liked the sandwich but I remember the chicken was a little too dry for my taste. I'm not afraid of a garlic taste but there was way too much garlic in the pesto. I got heartburn of course so now I know garlic is not a friend. 

I also bought the Apple Chia Breakfast Parfait that day. The first few bites tasted good...but then the cinnamon became OVERWHELMING. 

My second visit to Local Thyme was last week. An employee standing near the ""Warm Bowl"" line took my order. I asked for the Dragon Bowl and kindly asked that no red peppers be included. The employee informed me that they could not do that unless I had a food allergy. I was incredulous! I looked at her like she had two heads. I felt so uncomfortable and angry that I had to explain to her that I couldn't have red peppers because I have LPR. I know LPR/chronic acid-reflux isn't all the rage like gluten intolerance and doesn't have its own aisle at Whole Foods but I shouldn't have to explain my personal matters to a stranger! I awkwardly informed her that I had LPR and I was then allowed to not have red peppers. I feel bad for the employee who ends up taking an order from someone who suffers from IBS-D (Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea).

Later when I met up with my lunch mate I told her what happened. She said she was given the choice to replace an ingredient with another (she ordered a Dragon Bowl as well). I was not given this choice. I think if the employee had suggested I switch the red peppers with another ingredient the whole exchange would have been less aggravating for me. 

The Dragon Bowl was fine but I didn't think it was worth $9. I normally don't like peanut sauces but I didn't mind it in this dish.

This morning I gave Local Thyme a third chance. I remembered they had breakfast specials. I ran over and it was nice and dead in there. I ordered the Black Bean egg wrap. The ingredients listed on the board all sounded safe for me. There were quite a few listed so I assumed all of them were included. Well of course I noticed a small amount of red peppers and onions were in the wrap when I got back to the office. I really enjoyed the egg wrap though. I would like to order it again but now I'm all nervous about asking for no red peppers and onions! Are they going to ask for a signed doctor's note?

At this point I think the breakfast menu will be the safest for me. Dear god please come up with another set of waffle toppings other than acidic orange honey syrup and strawberries. If plain maple syrup and bananas or apples were offered as an alternative I would be all over those waffles at least once a week.

Here are my humble suggestions: 

1. Allow your customers to make minor ingredient adjustments.
2. Please make your menu more acid reflux friendly. Simply adding a low-fat dressing that doesn't have vinegar or citrus in it would make my day! I recall seeing a ""lemon tahini"" dressing listed on the board so I'm unclear if the ""tahini"" mentioned on the menu online is without lemon juice or not. A couple of light dishes that don't require onions, garlic, spicy sauces, etc. would be great.
3. It would be very helpful if ALL ingredients were listed on the menu (at least on the website). I know most places don't do this but seeing as Local Thyme already lists most anyway and claims to be health conscious they might as well finish the list in full.

"Venue? Not bad. Spacious but crowded.

Crowd? Not terrible. There's a few creeps here and there, but most people are there to have a good time. However, the dress code is pretty confusing. I'd say it oscillates between Big-Four-happy-hour-getup to Jersey-Shore-less-is-more-getup, depending on how good looking you are. 

Cover? Bad. $30 for dudes? I'm completely fine with paying for club covers, as obviously, businesses need to make money. However, $30 is ridiculous, especially considering we're getting the same, generic, crappy DJs that play the same, generic, ""hot mixes"". How about some real musical talent once in a while?

Bouncers? Terrible. Now I'll admit, finding nice bouncers in New York is akin to spotting Big Foot; they're literally nonexistent. However, the bouncers at Hudson are especially rude. Oh, your friend looks sick? Let's forcibly try to remove them instead of trying to help. Yup, how very kind of you.

Hopefully I'll have a better experience next time... LOL jk never coming back.",0.0
"We always try to find a good place that features 'burgers and fries/BAR food' as their go-to dishes for usually, we are always acquainted with our best meals at such places. So, after Comic Con this year, we thought it would be interesting to walk up to this restaurant and try it out once and for all.

Environment 7/10: First off, it's a corner-of-the-block kind of place so it isn't hard to miss and the outdoor seating goes all around; always a nice touch and one that we took advantage of. The seating was surprisingly spacious enough for us two, as it sat for four, with all of our merch and bags from the convention. Depending on how you feel about the streets and people outside, you are fenced off but you still have the busy and noisy road right in front of you but like I said, depending how you are with noisy and loud surroundings with your meal, I say go inside but we were happy as is. The bathroom was amazingly clean and very spacious, with the sick being away from the toilet and 'relief utensils' as my uncle calls them so if you need to wash your hands, you can do that without holding up anyone who had finished their 'duty'.

Service 6/10: The service was very good and I have very little to argue in this category with my review. We were seated within 5-7 minutes, considering how crowded and busy the restaurant was. The server was very frequent with our requests: taking our orders, refills, check, etc. They were professional and formal and made our time pleasant. One thing that had gotten on our nerves at one point was toward the end of out meal, we eventually asked for the bill. While the server went back inside to retrieve our tab, we waited almost ten minutes. Figured while awaiting his return, I made my way to find the bathrooms. While turning around to get up, I peered into the establishment and caught our server just leaning and hanging out by the bar, talking with a fellow employee as well as what seemed to be a customer whom he could have possibly knew, Im not sure.What ever the case was, I wasn't happy having to wait for them on my way out because they chose to take a few minutes to themselves and hold us up from our plans. I can only imagine how many more times this happened.

Food Quality 6/10: Last but not least, the food. Merg had ordered a vegetarian dish, artichoke dip with cheddar tots, and I went with the buffalo chicken breast with fries aside from an order of beer pretzel sticks to split. My sandwich was without a doubt delicious as well as the fried that accompanied it but the sauce had been drizzled over it, rather than the sauce be all over the fillet. I can also assume that our waiter had struck up another conversation on the way to get our order because the sauce had gone a bit hard and slightly chilled instead of the intended hot. We both agree that the pretzel sticks were nice, crisp with a sweet and soft center. The downside was the dip; oily, runny, soggy and beyond garlicky for the mrs.; and that says a lot coming from a girl who kisses a guy who eats whole cloves of the stuff. Another element that bugged me was pricing. Now, I'm not saying that I didn't do my research on this place's affordability before I chose to attend it. But when I can order dishes at other places, one's that are cooked nicely as well as properly, and I can view other eateries literally right across the street from me when my eating experience isn't going so well, it truly does hurt my time spent at 5.N.B.

Overall: We will admit we did enjoy my time here considering the company and also with just how much fun we had that day with the comic convention and all but when it came to finally settling down from being on our feet all day and just relaxing to some 'up-scale bar food', we were a bit disappointed. With our leisurely server taking their time, the food's pricing, as well as it reputation not matching its expected quality, we were let down but at least we were full. Def check it out on a day where it isn't as busy, especially not a Friday evening during a major social event like NYCC. It could have potential and come a time where Merg and I are in the neighborhood again and have no other food joint to check out, we just may give it another go",0.0
"Apparently they are about to film a TV show at URBO - we learned this as we exited after eating there on 5/2/15. And lemme tell you what, it's going to be one GOOD reality show because the service SUCKS. Like everyone is going to want to tune it to see how bad it is - sucks. Like you couldn't script this if you tried - sucks. Like this guy is cast for the role of ""unbelievably bad waiter"" and he hits a HOME RUN.

The food was - fine. Not great, just fine. I mean, it's Times Square, so I guess you can only expect so much. I didn't fear I was going to get food poisoning or anything. 

If you have to go here, it's not terrible, just don't expect any water in that water glass, nor a steak knife to cut your steak, nor your check (ever) - even if you ask multiple people, multiple times.",0.0
"I had high hopes for this place. People told me how good it was and I give them 2 stars because I know the food is good. Otherwise I would have given 1 star. 

I reviewed the menu before coming over and saw that all the vegetarian dishes are highlighted in green. Now l, I expect if there is a trace of meat, fish, etc that it would be noted in the ingredients. 
I ordered the grilled eggplant and zucchini. It comes with a sauce. I pour the sauce on my meal. My dinner partner orders the ribs and specifically tells them that he is severely allergic to shellfish and that we don't have an epi pen with us. 
His meal comes with a sauce and the server tells him when he brings the dish over that it's an anchovy based oil. It looked Aracely like my sauce. I ask if that's the same sauce and they say it is. Because j didn't ask for the vegan sauce. The menu doesn't say I need to specify sauces. 
I let them know that anchovies give me diarrhea and the fact that I just had a few bites wouldn't kill me however, if a dish that in no way states it's served with fish or meat and the menu online has me believe that islets vegetarian, I should NOT have to specify.  They made me feel as though the mistake was my fault and THAT bothers me!   

To make things worse, my dinner partner could feel that his food wasn't cooked cleanly even though he voiced his allergy and could feel his throat itching.

"The best place on earth!  My favorite food and not expensive.  I once had (3) cheeseburgers in a row, well in 1 sitting, over a few hours.  But still, they all tasted equally great, cause normally by burger 2 & 3 you're like ok maybe getting sick of this, but not this burger.  I cant' say enough.  I've heard people say this burger is better than Shake Shack and I completely agree.  The burger isn't even the best thing on the menu, but I mention it cause i'm addicted.  But you have to have the friend chicken.  It's legendary.  And any specials they put out - catch them while you can cause they rotate that regularly.  BRING BACK THE SHRIMP PO BOY!!! People say the service sucks, but I say it's not too bad.  You have to order at the bar, but I mean the pricing is so cheap, who cares.  I also love the drinks.  The best Pina Colada in town & maybe ask for a safety drink if you go in on a Wednesday.",0.0
"This novel Jewish delicatessen in the hip neighborhood the East Village sticks out like a sore thumb. Not because it dares to be different and push the boundaries, but because it's one of the only places left in the neighborhood that looks old-school.

I live around the corner from the place, and to be honest, I never had any desire to go here before. But today, I was forced, and it was pretty good. Then again how can you go wrong with $4.00 for four fried Pierogi and sour cream! I want to note that if you don't want fried you can order them boiled. The vegetable soup I ordered was bland, and contained too much cabbage.  

I didn't order the omlettes, but they looked soooo good and only cost $7.00-$9.00! The prices at B&H run from $3.00-$11.00 and the portions are huge!!! (I am so sick of high prices and for small portions). 

Be careful walking into this counter restaurant. The narrow walk way and small tables make it accident prone especially when bowls of soup and plates of poerogies are on top of the tables, and this clientele doesn't look like the understanding type. 

B&H is open from 7 am to 11 pm seven days a week. You can wear whatever you fancy. It's on 2nd ave between 7th and 8th street. Order the Pierogi, have an omlette, oh and eat the in-house baked challah bread.

"One of my only requests of what I wanted to do on my NYC trip was to find a Wafels and Dinges truck, but we found a store instead!!Ever since I saw this place on Eat Street (and realized how sad Toronto food trucks really are!) I knew I needed to try a savoury waffle. 

After stumbling upon a stand which unfortunately had only sweet waffles, we went to explore the store front. It is well laid out with a good menu of both sweet and savoury waffles, as well as drinks and a small store to take home your own waffles. 

The service was prompt, though I'll admit it was a bit casual in that the two staff members working were loudly talking amongst themselves while they made the waffles - but that wasn't a big issue. 

I had the pulled pork waffle and was basically the happiest person in the world. The waffles were crispy outside and soft inside, the pulled pork had a delicious BBQ sauce, and the coleslaw was tangy and really added to the waffle.

The best part of this waffle was that I didn't feel at all sick or ""gross"" after eating it, which greasy food can sometimes do to me. I only felt like I wanted another waffle!",0.0
"""Gourmet"" Cupcakes are becoming a commodity, you can even pick up decent ones in the NYC deli's now-a-days.  Magnolia's are good, soft, and very sweet.  So sweet that I sometimes feel sick after eating them.  

I've been here a few times, and the prices seem to keep going up, yet the cupcakes seem to be getting smaller.  Not a good trend in the long run.  I'd go once just to try, but when deciding where you need to get sweets for a group, I'd definitely look elsewhere!",0.0
"The oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookies are like scones, very dry on the outside, but raw on the inside. That is the key to the gooeyness--they are raw. It tastes like flour. I could eat a roll of Tollhouse dough for cheaper (these cookies are $4 each).

The chocolate-chocolate chip was ok, and the chocolate peanut butter was by far my favorite. Both were still dry on the outside, but at least they didn't taste like raw flour and egg on the inside. The peanut butter cookies are not sweet, which I like, but still not the best. Felt sick after eating half of the chocolate peanut butter cookie.

All in all, long lines, expensive cookies that are raw in the middle, dry on the outside. Pass.",0.0
"BE AWARE OF DELIVERY. Raw inside of 2pieces of a full chicken.
Ok i know most of the chicken deliveries around here can take from 40mins -1hour around here. You should be expecting fully cooked for a whole chicken that costs over $20. 
I waited approx. 50 mins. I was already starving. Anyhow, I ordered a whole chicken and fries. I finished a piece of leg which was fine. Then started on a breast and as i chewed something felt mushy, and then there i see the red. So already feeling disgusted, i still try another breast but by ripping with hands but this one the outer layer is uncooked slightly kinda pink and opaque. 
So furious called them up and all they can say is we can give u another. I declined due to the fact feeling disgusted, not waiting another hour. Had to fill stomach with fries.
I was really hungry and expected some good chicken. People can make mistakes but this i really hate.

"Bad food, terrible service. I went there once before and had a spicy eggplant dumpling which was good but it's no longer on the menu. Today I ordered veggie dumplings and ended up with veg and mystery meat - hoping I don't get food poisoning based on reviews below! - and rice, which was drowning in soy sauce and was an unappetizing sodium bomb. I also got an earl grey tea and when I asked for milk to put in it they had to call over the supervisor. You can only get milk if you order a latte, otherwise the most they'll give you is coffeemate, a delicious petroleum product. So customers have to get a milky latte when all they want is a touch of milk in their tea?! Cheap and ridiculous. The supervisor was completely rude, the person who took the order was ESL and didn't understand me. All around bad experience. Won't be back.",0.0
"I have been coming here on and off since the day I turned 21 almost 9 years ago.  
Over the years almost nothing has really changed and I LOVE that!!!  Anytime I want to go somewhere to have a drink and not care about anything but good music (I like country and classic rock) and dancing (floor or bar) I come here!  I don't have to worry about someone taking pictures or messing with me (security would never allow it).  

There are plenty of awful reviews on yelp and I am so sick of the idiocy! So these are my responses to the most annoying:
This bar was NOT created to be based on the movie Coyote Ugly, the movie and then the chain were originally based on here!!!  It isn't going to ""burn down"" ""get closed"" or any of the other things you prisses want to happen because its been here for decades and has a loyal happy base clientele.
If you want to be ""treated with respect and dignity"" and aren't looking for an environment for blue collars to let loose and be intense then don't go in the bar with the multiple bikes parked in front of it!!  I haven't seen a single biker, off duty firefighter, or on leave military man have a problem with the insults and tough love of the bartenders but I've seen plenty of the ""hipsters"" run crying...

If you want to play at being in a rock/country hardass bar but your skin is too thin for the real thing you should stick to the chain bars like CU.  

And for pete's sake stop whining about the stupid cover!!!! $5-$10 is nothing for the city let alone the neighborhood!  Half the clubs charge twice to quadruple that...

Lastly I'll admit that some of the ceiling speakers and things like that are dusty but the main bar (the thing you drink on, the chairs, the bathrooms) isn't dirty at all.  I wear  a lot of white and would know, never got a thing on my cloths.",0.0

I love that the vegetarian options are marked on the menu and I especially love that they don't taste like typical light/healthy veg options.

The bartender Barry is hilarious. 
The food is fabulous also.  I loved the curried potato croquettes and I could probably eat the Mapo Cheese Fries every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of it.  
On one of my visits I also ordered the horse mackerel special, which for only 7 dollars gave me a pile of fried whole little fish that were fantastic popper appetizers.

"Where do I begin

SERVICE: very friendly we were early for lunch and were allowed to have a booth which was very nice because there were only us two. However, on our arrival we doubled the attendance by our entering.

MENU: what you would expect from an americanized pub with the added burgers and toastie sandwiches.

THE PROBLEM:  The food is terrible. The burger was not only a well done on a medium rare order but cold to the touch. It had been sitting around and reheated and was not only cold and well done but tasted Aged and not in a good way. The onion soup was visually unrecognizable as such and upon tasting so salty I cannot remember having such a degree of salt in a dish before the old school cafeteria switch between sugar and salt. Who knows!? I had ordered a special roast Turkey sandwich with cranberry mayo served BLT style. I love fresh roasted turkey and had asked the server if this was indeed fresh roasted. I know I should have known but I had introduced ourselves as locals and first timers really looking forward to the experience. Neither one of us could get by more than one bit. I cannot describe the taste beyond to say we were both expecting to get really sick. So far so good. I hate saying bad things about places but they really need to step back and realize what is going on. So for now buyer beware I'm sure the brews are great.",0.0

When we're not sick and we're just looking for good food at a good price, we head here for their over-rice-entrees.  We usually range from the chicken lemongrass to basil chicken to grilled chicken to cubed beef to curry.  They are very consistent with their flavors so ou never have a bad meal.  The portions do not disappoint.  I know of other viet restaurants that skimp out on the chicken or beef over time.  By now I'm sure the waiters know us because we frequent the place so much.  Sometimes I swear they give us an extra serving of chicken or beef.  The spring rolls are a must too!  We've also tried their pad thai and young chow fried rice and they are pretty good too!  In my book, this is the best restaurant for flavor and price.  You cannot get any better than this.",0.0
"This place always seems to hit the spot.  I always seem to come here after about a year or so, and it always tastes the same.  A favorite spot for my friends and family alike.  

The stairs down are a bit steep so be careful with your elderly family members and young children.  

As for the menu.. yes it is true they have a separate menu for non-Asians.  So if you're not Asian, try coming here with one.  They have some dishes that you will not see on the menu that you would otherwise.

Some favorite dishes that we always get:

1)  Pan-fried Flounder
2)  Cantonese Style Crab
3)  Snails 
4)  Frog Legs
5)  Beef Chow Fun (the best you'll find anywhere)
6)  Squid in Black Bean Sauce
7)  Honey Walnut Shrimp (AWESOME!)
8)  Clams
9)  Fried Pork Chop
10)  Crispy Chicken

Be sure to slather your rice with the sauces from the dishes.  Sooo good and adds to your experience.

"Hands down 

Worst meal ever... horrendous service, extremely bland.  My waiter -- if that's what you want to call him -- openly jeered me. It was actually just plain bizarre. Saw multiple roaches at the side windows .

Do yourself a favor and get some street meat instead -- I ended up getting pretty sick after to boot

Here's an update -- the manager sent a message to my girlfriend regarding our last visit.

In it, he attacked her appearance (personally, I'm a bit incredulous as to that -- cuz I think she's pretty fine... Then again, I'm biased :P) and personally attacked her ""class"" saying she was not fit to even dine in a fine establishment like Barawine and that we're not their ""target audience""... Not quite sure what a target audience has to do with showing basic respect... But anyways...

I could get on my soap box and start running down our resumes but what's the pt? This individual doesn't deserve that much of my attention span...

I want to direct the remainder of this msg to folks considering or continuing to show patronage to Barawine.

Bottom line - I haven't received a message this baseless or endured a series of treatments at an establishment this, borderline xenophobic since my days out and about in Boston while I was at Harvard -- I've actually never been made to feel any less than human anywhere else in NYC

People, THIS is what you can expect to receive at this place. THIS is the type of individual they have at the top in general management of the business... Now I'm not sure what in my appearance or general demeanor screamed to this individual that I was not worthy of common courtesy (perhaps I was missing a stay in my collar or the Windsor knot of my tie was unappealing ... Geez I hope it's just that and not something uglier and more hateful), but I do know customers should not be treated like this simply because they're not a fan of the service received (in my defense though I did get sick from the food and did have a waiter who was doing his damnedest to insult me in front of my significant other...)

Vegetable frittata so over cooked with tons of marinara sauce and melted cheese - rather sickening plus burnt food in home fries that looked like cock roaches ( I hope) - it wasn't but just added to the unappetizing food and poor service.

"Sometime later on in the evening we would have went to watch a friend of a friend perform. We went to two other places by in hopes that we would grab a quick bite to eat. We ended up coming back here when the two others were packed and no room to even squeeze in another party of five even in the midst of crowds. We realized, holy damn! We should've came here in the first place. 

Sports bar with large TV screens everywhere. (It doesn't matter where you sit -- you'll have a good view.) The place was clean and food wasn't the best I've had in bars, but a lot better than other sports bars I've been to. We had a sample platter, sliders, and nacho dips. The platter came with 7 spring rolls (my boss counted bc he loves spring rolls), nicely sized chicken strips, calamari, wings, and one more thing I think? Food did not disappoint at all. The sliders were juicy and tasty as they were--didn't even need to add condiments to spice it up. 

Our waitress was Elizabeth and she did an awesome job with the 6 of us. Quick speedy service, great demeanor, great customer service, went along with our shenanigans when we were joking around, and had such great memory of what our drinks were. She came around every now and then and would just ask ""do you want another [insert drink name]"" without asking you to repeat what you ordered 20 minutes ago. This girl deserves a raise for her excellent service skills. Not just because she remembered our drinks but her entire service with us was great. 

Only downside to this place is that it is way too loud at the bar. You scream and still can't hear each other.

What we really came for was the band. Who knew there was a live alternative rock band playing somewhere on 2nd ave? Kudos to the band for an awesome time.  Great song covers and surely got the crowd going with those familiar tunes. Though I wish they rocked out Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit instead of mashing it with Nirvana's other songs. 

So.... All you bands out there.. This is a great place to rock out. You get a wonderful crowd, good food, and a sick location in Manhattan to do so.

"In Memoriam: 

I moved to Astoria in June of 2012. Little place on 38th between 34th and Broadway. It's a pretty nice neighborhood, with restaurants and bars and street meat and a crack head who carries around  a suitcase and wears Dre Beats. There are so many stray cats. 

When I first moved in, right off of my subway stop (Steinway St.), there was a giant, vacant building on the corner. I'm pretty sure that this used to be a salvation army, as I bought a Shaq jersey there and I never forget where I buy my Shaq jerseys. But, I moved there and there's this hulking mammoth of a space completely open, unknown, like the universe... 

A few months go by. It's probably September. I notice that there are TV's being hung on the inside, a bar is being constructed in the center of this giant windowed mass. I think two things. Strip Club? If only. Sports Bar? More likely. But what was truly built there was more wonderland than bar, more paradise than libation factory, more romantic walk on the beach than over the pants hj. It was Buds, and it's signal was foreshadowed by the large beer tap that glowed blue and true in the olive oil smelling Astoria air. 

For a few weeks it looked like Bud's was going to be opened. I'd pass by every day, but nothing. Then, on a Thursday I believe, the doors were open. The TVs were on. The beer was flowing. The Pearly Gates had been pushed forth and Heaven awaited. Before seeing this I had convinced my girlfriend to go to the lowly Panera around the corner from us, but upon seeing this event, I decided to burn down the Panera. Thankfully I didn't do that because I do rather like their big kid grilled cheese. 

We go expecting the typical fair. Thursday Night football (Ravens vs. Browns yuck) and beer. My girlfriend and I, at the time, were 22 and fresh out of school. We were not the most sophisticated beer drinkers of yet. Walking into Bud's and looking at the menu was like getting a 7th grader a paid subscription to a porn site.  Our hands were shaking. ""21st Prohibition what?"" we said. ""Triple Horse, what's that like?"". ""Stout, Ale, Lager, Amber, oh my."" We didn't actually say the last one. 

Our waitress looked like she was fifteen, which usually is a warning sign, but being an occasional optimist, I decided that this time good things were going to come in small packages. She was in fact not a great server, but I couldn't help but feel that we were sharing something truly special. She got us our beers and we drank them and watched the game. We probably had 4 beers, and it was love. We tipped well, we said thank you, and we were on our way. 

We went back the next day because we're fat fatties. We got more brews in our bellies and also decided to try the wings. Holy ball sacks, I didn't know what wings could taste like...and that has nothing to do with how stuffy my nose can get when drinking! They were great. On more than one occasion the Sun Sauce wings left me reeling from their flavor and sent me to the toilets early and often. Even the diarrhea was just the right amount of spicy. 

For the next year and change we went to Bud's on occasion. Sometimes as much as 4 times a month. We did notice that it had gotten louder, and the crowd more obnoxious and ""suity"", but that didn't matter, Buds was ours. Oh, big shout out to Jacob, who one night stole my heart with his glasses, great service, thankful attitude, and the fact that he looked exactly like me. Also, big ups to the guy who talked to me about my Cactus Jack t-shirt; it made up for the fact you got our order wrong. You were a cool dude. Also, big, big thanks to the man who seemed to seat us every Thursday...you truly were a god among men and the backbone of the establishment and my life. 

So a year passes, November comes. My lady and I are slated to move ( we have mice because we're filthy, filthy people). We get a new place in the ultra hip 30th ave region. We actually are moving today. I go on to Yelp to see if Bud's is being renovated, perhaps being made larger. More tv's? More beers? More handsome and beautiful servers? Nope. It's closed. Closed down forever. I feel like my son died, but worse, because my son was an asshole and Bud's was the greatest. 

Buds, I know you're up there in bar heaven. I take solace in that fact. I don't believe in people heaven, but I do believe in Bar Heaven and Dog Heaven. I hope you're happy up there with your Triple Horses and your Cannonball Sauce, because you deserve it. You made dinner great for my girlfriend and my friends, and I'll speak of you fondly.

"My husband and I have basically made this place a second home.  The soup dumplings are simply amazing!  We prefer the pork dumplings to the crab & pork dumplings, but both are fantastic!  A word of caution to any first-timers: The soup inside of these dumplings  is very hot!  The way I eat them is to place the dumpling onto my soup spoon, then pierce or carefully bite the top of the dumpling to allow some of the steam to escape.  Then, you can add some of the ginger soy sauce provided for an extra element of flavor.  Make sure you don't just pop the dumpling into your mouth whole otherwise you will scorch yourself!

I also enjoy the crispy dough, the salt soy bean milk, the dumplings in peanut sauce, the spicy beef tripe salad and the crispy noodles.  The staff are friendly and they always remember us and know what we want.  The restaurant has recently expanded, so they have three adjacent seating areas and can accommodate large parties.  They are also open early and close late, so you can go whenever you have a craving for soup dumplings.  

Most important to me, as my friends know, is hygiene.  Their food is clean and I have always left there feeling great (and I am very, very prone to getting sick after a bad meal).  They consistently get ""A"" ratings, which is so refreshing.

It is a shame that they are cash only, but if you walk over a couple of blocks to Main Street, there are maybe 3 banks within close proximity.  

I highly recommend this place for their wonderful dumplings - one of my all-time favorite restaurants!",0.0
"Great atmosphere, love the vibe of this place. They also have free live jazz playing on a weekday. It was a little noisy but the nice music was welcomed. The food here was really good. Rich, flavorful and filling enough that it doesn't make you feel sick. I ordered the fish sample dish which came with smoke salmon, caviar, and few other things which had a great combo. I also ordered the beef short rib and it was tiny, but overall I was full by the end of the dinner. Food is pretty pricey here so come here on occasions. For me, it was for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. He was happy and satisfied, so that's good.",0.0
"My boyfriend and I are interning here for the summer, and struggled for the first couple of weeks trying to find a hookah lounge that matched the one we had back at home. Sahara is that place. It's located conveniently around the corner from our NYU dorm, and the owner is a HUGE believer in the fact that the customer should always get what they want. They are fantastic at changing coals, doctoring your hookah, and have quick, great service over all. 

Also, they just make sure you're taken care of. They know my boyfriend and I are regulars (at least while we are here), and I got really sick the last time we were there and they were more than helpful in getting me fresh air, liquids, and a chair. 

Essentially, great service, customer satisfaction, and oh yeah. GREAT smoking hookah.",0.0
"I, too love Mew. 
I've taken a few friends to this kind of out-of-the-way spot and they love it too!
Now, I'm not fan of Japanese food, no, not in the slightest. I don't eat raw fish (don't judge me) and what I've had at other restaurants has always made me sick. Not here. They have such a great selection of food that you will find something for every person, even the really, really, really picky ones like myself. 

The vibe is like teenage mutant ninja turtles/in Japan/eating cool food. After work is when I usually come and even if there is a wait, it's so short I hardly notice. The tables are large enough to accommodate all the small dishes that you'll be ordering, which is so nice. 

Don't know what to get? Don't worry, they have a picture menu! I love it! My favorites are the fried squid and potato salad. Don't judge. 

They also have a good selection of beers, but like only one cocktail and a few sakes. It's a great place for a group, a date, or even solo. It's a small space, but large too. Does that make sense?",0.0
"This is such an iconic hotel and lounge in the NYC nightlife circuit. I have been to many  parties here and the penthouse is gorgeous! 

The staff are always friendly and the cleanliness of this building is remarkable. The ambiance is very trendy, entrance sometimes requires a special password for the parties and they make it very chic. The staff are very attractive.

If you are looking to for a place to see or be seen, you have found it. I look for places that provide a special and exclusive ambiance with sexy lighting, sick dj and the crowd. 

The crowd here is surprisingly nothing like other places such as the Dream Hotel.

"I hate to give one star, because I've also been an employee at a gourmet store like the Ploughman. But this person did things I'd never do, and the more experienced employee should have watched over him a bit more:

-I asked for a half pound of cheese, and I was offered me a third pound cheese end. I said no thanks, and was cut the ""fresh"" cheese instead. When I unwrapped it at home, I saw pink mold around the edge. I cut it off, but my mouth is itching as I write this. Doesn't feel good to waste $10 on bad-mould-y cheese that is probably going to make me sick. 

-It's scary to put your hand close to the slicer, I know. It wasn't bolted properly to the table either. But don't tell me you can't cut me a thin slice because ""the pieces will be too short."" Have the other person do it. Nothing worse than getting home and having extra-thick, uneven, stuck-together prosciutto (no wrap between the slices).

-Please don't type into your iPhone when you have my credit card in your hand. I'm a human being. I also don't want to have to convince myself you're not stealing my CC number.

You seem like a really smart person, and I know you'll move on to bigger and better things. But in the meantime, please be open to learning how to not be a butthead. It makes it not worth it to go there.",0.0

"Party of 4, had a reservation for early Saturday dinner. Were seated promptly by a friendly host, provided with a gluten-free menu for the celiac at the table (me), and dinner was off to a good start.

Barn Joo loses one star for the food being a little hit or miss and for an overpriced beer and wine list. 

They lose another star for inappropriate treatment of gluten-free request. Dish came out with a piece of baguette on it. I flagged the waitress and asked for a new one. Because many restaurants will just take the bread off and pretend it's a new dish, I poked a hole in the duck confit with my finger and tore one of the lettuce leaves in a zig zag. 

Two minutes later I got the same dish back, with the ""tells"" clearly visible. I explained to the waitress that I needed a new dish because a few crumbs would make me sick. She said some mumbo jumbo about thinking I just wanted a new plate (there's no way the dish was replated, so that was a lie). Eventually she came back with a remade dish, and then ignored our table for the rest of the evening. 

If no one in your party has dietary restrictions, you'll have an OK time here.",0.0
"A huge banner out front *claims* ""Best Gluten Free Pizza in Brooklyn."" Which would be great. If it were true. But it's not. 

The waiter who ""helped"" us was ill-informed and condescending--worse, his advice was down-right dangerous. 

Here's the conversation after informing the waiter that I have Celiac Disease--and so gluten contamination has a serious health ramifications: 
""No problem. We've had Celiacs in here since we opened. I'm very aware of it."" 
""Great! So you have separate pans."" 
""No."" 
""?""
""We have shared pans, a shared oven, and shared cook space. But don't worry, the gluten all burns off in the oven. Besides, there's flour in the air here, so if you're okay breathing that then you'll be okay eating the pizza."" 

There are so many false things in there that I don't even know where to begin. ...if the gluten burns off in the oven, then how come the entire pizza isn't charcoal? ...and you're telling me that different organs don't react differently to different foods? 

I understand wait staff is frequently uninformed about food allergies, but to present yourself as an expert and then dispense advice that could make someone very, very sick? Ugh.",0.0
"Best pizza place in Queens.  No kidding.  A hidden gem.  I've been coming to this place for over 20 years and I have to say it's always been fantastic.  

You can't go wrong.  Their regular pies are great.  Their sicilian is FANTASTIC.  

One thing I wanted to comment on is that you can tell that they use high quality ingredients.  The pepperoni doesn't drip oil everywhere and doesn't make you feel sick for ordering it.  Their meatballs and sausage are good too.  

This place can be pricey for pizza but it's totally worth it.  Vinny is one of the nicest people I know and it's always pleasant talking with him when I go there. I'm so glad his place has remained a staple in my diet for so long.  :)",0.0

"My wife and I were excited to try this cafe as it looked very tasty and they had a great selection of French and asian inspired treats. I believe it is a Korean cafe so there are items like curry bread and cream puffs etc. 

Upon ordering some cream puffs and a bread for taking home with a tea and water my wife and I sat down. It was not until we had eaten 2 of the small cream puffs ( 15 or so come in a box ) each that we realized there was a slightly funny taste.. maybe it was cheese, maybe not but then we saw the green hairy mold on a few of the other cream puffs still in the box. We spit out what we could and I approached the cashier. I told her what happened, and I explained that it's bad to eat mold especially when your wife is PREGNANT,  and she promptly made a phone call.. It  was then realized she was not asking for the manager or getting more help for me, but she did to know how to use the register to give me my money back. I was speechless expecting at least to talk to a manager or someone to make sure we were not going to get sick. She gave me 6 dollars back, did not comp the tea or water and was confused at what the big deal was. she kept saying "" I did not know"" and i was not sure what that meant. 

I understand that sometimes food gets mold on it.. accidents happen...but then you say SORRY, or ARE YOU OK?, or WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE THIS BETTER? or PRETEND TO CARE.  minus 77 stars / don't go here.",0.0
"Updating from my original review.  Reiterating that the sushi is dirt cheap, however updating that Masago's hygiene standards leave me painfully concerned.  On our recent visit both the men's and women's rooms were out of soap.  We asked for soap and the employee said there was no more soap, unscrewed the existing bottle, added water, closed the bottle and said, ""this is good enough.""  EARTH TO MASAGO: YOUR EMPLOYEES MAKE SUSHI FOR A LIVING - RAW FISH MADE WITH ONE'S HANDS.  SOAP IS SOMETHING YOU REQUIRE, PARTICULARLY AFTER GOING POTTY.  Bottom line, cheap sushi but not worth getting sick over.  The hygienic standards are bare bones so eat her at your own risk.  You have been warned.",0.0

"I will never again go to the Tiki Bar for dinner.. 

This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Even after moving to NJ, I would constantly make plans to go to this restaurant with friends. Most of the time we would just have drinks and an appetizer. The Sangria is delicious! 

However, the new outside menu is terrible.  So we can choose appetizers, sandwiches or salads. What happened to the entrees you used to offer for people who wanted dinner? I asked the waitress for a dish that I always order off the menu and was told she would ask if they could get it for me. She returned to inform me that they couldn't do the pasta outside right now.. I'm obviously a regular if I specifically asked for a dish and most places would accommodate a request from a customer. 

I would've left to go somewhere else but we had already ordered a pitcher of Sangria and an appetizer. So now after only two drinks and sharing two small fried appetizers, I'm still hungry but I feel sick and dizzy. Don't expect a nice dinner outside anymore.",0.0

"definitely too much hype over this place. we stumbled upon this stall around 9:30 pm Saturday night after the cart near Madison square garden closed. the waffles were cold, hard as a rock, and tasted slightly stale. 

ordered the wafel with speculoos, strawberries, and cream ($8). quite a disappointment. the speculoos was practically frozen on top of the wafel instead of melting into it.

"Haste makes waste: I chose this place at the last minute because I wanted paella and I needed to accommodate others for traveling time. We ordered 2 paellas and some empanadas. The empanadas were fine, but the paella was a disaster. The chicken in one of them had a funny, not-so-fresh taste. Then, my friend found a hair in his clam. They also must have put the mussels in too soon because they were dry and charred. They had a grade pending sign, so I looked them up at the NYC DOH site and they have a sorry history with the DOH. In June they racked up 30 points for an ungraded inspection, and a week before my dinner they got 20 points at a graded inspection for issues related to mice, roaches, improper food temperatures, etc. Also, they told us that we could only use their free beer/dessert check in deal for one person at the table. Only one of us got a beer anyway so we said we would use it for that. Despite knowing this, our server still charged the beer. Well we noticed this on the check, and she said she needed to check off the deal as used on the yelp app. That's fine, but when we are 1 of 2 tables being served it's obvious you were trying to charge us in hopes we had forgotten.

"I used to enjoy this kind of stuff when I was younger and way more broke. The more you learn about the importance of proper meat storage and refrigeration practices, and the more you experience getting sick from food a few times, you really learn to appreciate real quality food.

This isn't quality food. Maybe it tastes good to an extent but for $6, you have to remember what you're getting. I can't imagine the quality of meat being used here being  decent and food stands don't have to answer to the same rigorous guidelines as restaurants. Where is their meat stored? I've seen vans pull up dropping off big bags of meat and that's not a pleasant sight to see.  All I know for sure is I've never felt good after eating one of these things, even half a portion which it really should be. 

I'm convinced eating these platters take years off your life. I know that it's a big tourist spot with a lot of hype, but I don't recommend it. You know what, just do yourself a favor and dont buy food on the street in general. Your body and mind will thank you for it.",0.0
"My initial good impression of them has gone downhill. Not sure what happened!
The first time was great, had the veggie burger, which I thought was amazing. The 2nd time, the veggie burger was basically raw in the middle. Sure there's no meat and probably wouldn't have gotten sick from eating it, but it was just unpleasant.
The 3rd time, the fries were cold, and the veggie burger was more like a unflavorful spinach burger. I only ate a few bites. I also had the roasted vegetables, which were good but arrived cold and the basil oil they used spilled out of the bag. 
So I will not be ordering from them again.",0.0
"So, I have mixed feelings. As a foodie from Colorado I was stoked to grab some ramen while in Midtown, since ramen is kinda just breaking into the market in Denver. Prices were good, especially for Manhattan, and I enjoyed the ramen that I got - broth had incredibly rich flavor, noodles had good texture and consistency, and the dish had a lot of harmony in terms of flavor. (I can't remember exactly which bowl it was, I believe the #4 [beef bone broth]) Service was attentive, but average. The space looked moderately clean, not sketchy like some places I've visited in Brooklyn or Chinatown.

As for cons, it supposedly had beef in it, but the meat (although tasty) looked awfully gray and unappealing. As a relatively adventurous eater with a strong-willed stomach, I figured what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and it didn't make me sick, but it definitely was an eyebrow-raiser. The big concern was what my bf ordered. He wanted eggs (as it was our first meal of the day) and ordered the Katsudon. He had to send it back because the egg wasn't fully cooked and the dish was basically inedible. Fortunately I don't eat much so he got to munch on mine :)

Decent stop for lunch if it's on your way, but I wouldn't stray from ramen and I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.",0.0

I got the endless brunch... Bloody Mary's and I ordered the heart stopper- hangar steak, poached eggs and 'crispy bacon and onions'. My bacon was limp and my steak was cold. Fries were not crisp. The first bloody Mary had a lemon wedge and every one after didnt. Our waitress had a great attitude but she seemed overwhelmed.

I ordered a coke but was told that they only had diet coke and dr. Pepper. The waiter was nice and offered to go to the next store over and get me one.

"serious dive bar. First time in Greenpoint because we were visiting my son and we picked this place because of the Groupon. $13 for 2 drafts, 2 burgers w/ sides. We walk in there on a Saturday night around 8:30pm and the place is empty.  Hmm not a good sign. There are 12 drafts on tap, so we pick our beers which were fine. You have a choice of 1 burger, yes I wrote 1. When I told the bartender I would like mine cooked medium, he replied that the burgers are cooked only 1 way. When the burger comes out, it is the size of a McDonalds burger [very thin], with a small order of fries. It didn't taste bad, and I have not gotten sick.  I suppose the $13 groupon covered the cost of the 2 drafts and I should consider the burger w/fries free? I'm from CT, and I don't know NYC draft prices.",0.0

"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. Went late on a Friday, 4 of us, for 3 drinks and 1 coffee with dessert. My dessert was NOT a ""homemade slice of cake"" as listed. One of those mass produced, rectangular shaped layered NYC desserts that everyone has. One friend ordered a glass of red wine, that was obviously old and had turned to vinegar. One friend ordered a cocktail that literally made her sick after 3-4 sips. We weren't given a last call or heads up that they were closing, so when she asked for some ginger ale to settle her stomach, we were told they had closed their soda fountain. Waitress brought her a Pellagrino instead and then proceeded to charge her $7 for it. Asked to speak to the manager (who refused to come to the table) but sent the bill back with a $3 discount, with no mention of a discount for the $18 NASTY cocktail that made her sick. Having spent 20+ years in the restaurant business as a manager and a server I was VERY disappointed especially since I was the one who had chosen this spot.

"I WAS going to give this place a 5-star review.  I loved the atmosphere, location, awesome service, and the food was all delicious and came out quickly, despite how packed out this place was.  Seriously, I wanted to order one of everything on the menu!  But now comes the bad part.  My son has a shellfish allergy. We did not order anything remotely shellfish related.  Not long after we left the restaurant, my son was feeling sick to his stomach and then he started itching all over and turning red.  This was our first night in the city, and a trip we had saved up money for MONTHS to make happen.  I was seriously panicked.  I kept racking my brain to try to figure out what in the world could have happened to make my son ill.  Thankfully a late-night run to a Walgreens nearby our hotel and mega dose of Benadryl calmed his reaction and he was fine the next day.  I called the restaurant the next afternoon to speak to the Manager.  At first he told me ""We take great precautions to avoid cross contamination"" but then he asked what we ordered: Fettucini alfredo, meatballs for an appetizer, and Chicken parmesan.  He then went on to tell me the chicken parmesan is fried in a grease pot that sits right next to the grease pot where seafood is fried, and he explained that sometimes the grease can ""jump"" from one pot to the other.  Great precautions, MY BUTT!  He offered to let us come back in and treat us to a meal ""on the house"", but why in God's name would we even want to go back?!

I tried bites of my friends' scotch egg and deviled egg dishes and it would recommend those for sure, but not before I would recommend the short ribs.

"SUMMARY : I FOUND A BUG IN MY KHEER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS ATROCIOUS!



Long story : So I bought 2 small kheers [rice pudding] from here for pickup. Once home, midway eating through one of the kheer, I found a little bug in my kheer [it wasn't a fly and it wasn't a mosquito, it was one of those bugs that are attracted to the lights. At this point I was raged, angry and felt sick! I called their number right away, and forget an apology, the guy on the phone told me to bring it in. So I spent another 15 minutes walking back to the place and when I got there I showed the employee the bug I found the kheer in. First he pretended not to see the bug, then when I showed it to him, he accused me of putting it there!!! And then he created a whole scene! He then told me I was never allowed to order kheer again! He then told me he wanted to exchange the kheer with more kheer from the same batch!!! I told him I would simply like a refund for both the kheers since they were from the same batch! This guy then had on a furious face and made a whole big scene in front of all his employees and made up a lie and said this was the second time I gave him an issue? What?!! It was the first time I ever had to go back to any place because I found a bug in my food! I felt like throwing up but couldn't. It was one of the worst experiences ever of my life. This place should not be allowed to sell. Contaminated food. Oh what's worse is that he didn't even throw the rest of the batch out. He probably sold the rest of the contaminated kheer. And needless to say no apology!",0.0
"We went there because the restaurants that we wanted to go were not open and this is the closest asian food nearby. The decor and presentation of the place looked decent - but very soon we had regrets.

When we entered the restaurant, the people who worked there looked at us, then just ignored us like they didn't see anything.

So we worked further into the restaurant and just stand there, finally someone got us and my husband said the people who work there looks like a zombie, so lifeless and you will see why.

We asked what is good. Being Chinese in a Chinese restaurant, we just wanted something more authentic so we asked that question but the waiter said ""we have pig, seafood, beef and vegetable"" Right like I am illiterate and can't read the menu?

Anyhow, we ordered some food and the first dish was the lotus leaf rice, and I spit it right out on my first bite. It was SPOILED. I was not looking for something delicious, I only wanted something to eat, but that dish totally tasted spoiled and my husband agreed. The sticky rice was also not heated all the way, some part was warm, some part was cold and spoiled - it was a taste of foulness. We spit it back out, and the waiter collected the plate and asked ""are you finished""? I was speechless I didn't want to make a scene. 

They recommended the beef as ""fresh"" so we ordered it, and trust me - Panda express or ANY Chinese take out place does better. Their beef was so overdone with baking soda you can't taste any beef in there.

We both came to the conclusion that the hot water the best out of everything. We got so tricked into this place by the high rating and please don't go there - if you don't want food poisoning please stay out.",0.0
"I feel like the owner of this establishment is just taking advantage of the people that live in this community. We have been living in Long Island City for a year now and have been shopping at Foodcellar because we haven't had a car and it is the only grocery store in the neighborhood. Like many of you i'm sure. I find myself at the food cellar sometimes twice a day a morning coffee and to pick up something quick for breakfast. Then run back down for dinner to grab something I am missing or need for a recipe. But I am just sick of paying such high prices! I use to come more often to pick a few basic items and leave paying about $60/ $70 dollars. We have found better solutions - of course online grocery shopping and blue apron. I just wish this establishment would listen to what there costumers are saying. Don't you want people to be happy and continue to keep coming back instead of going elsewhere.... it`s only a matter of time until something else opens up in the neighborhood and steals major of the costumers away.

On a positive note. The employees here are WONDERFUL! Everyone is always so friendly and helpful here. Whenever I have a question about a product they always have an answer for me. Jay is great!!",0.0

Prepared foods is pretty terrible.  They should really throw out and prepare fresh after a day or two but they let the same crap sit there for 4-5 days...Guarantee someone will get food poisoning from here.  Whole Foods will put them out of business.,0.0
"I ordered food for delivery and was pleasantly surprised. I was quoted a one-hour wait time, but it took about half an hour for my food to arrive. I only ordered entrees and appetizers so I can't speak for the sushi, but the food i did get was really good. 

Things that stood out: 
- The rice was flavorful (a little savory, a little sweet) but not flavored aka I could eat it on its own. 
- The General Tso's chicken (I got it mildly spiced) left an interesting heat (for like, half an hour) instead of an aftertaste. Maybe this is because they use chili oil for spicing?
- The leftovers were actually good enough to eat on the second day! No weird congealing or crunchiness happened! After having been left in the fridge all night! Y'all know what I'm talking about. Yeah, even the rice was 100% edible!
- I actually got fortune cookies in my bag! I didn't even know places did that anymore.

The prices are a little high for takeout, but let's be real, you're paying for something that's a little nicer than the carryout on the corner...and this is the first time I've ordered from an asian takeout place around here and haven't gotten food poisoning and/or hair in my soup.",0.0
"Possibly one of the few places to really get authentic Chinese food, and at 3 in the morning.  Seriously this place breaks so many health violations I'm surprised it's still in business.  So here is the breakdown...

You looking for great crab meat yee mein and salt pepper crab at 2AM?  This is your spot.  Flavourful, you can tase the nuances of flavours, the subtle contrast of textures, and the pride of Asian cuisine.

You want cleanliness, wholesome environment, a meal that does not incorporate any combination of the three main vices of life.... look elsewhere.

Just for the record, ate here numerous times and never got sick.",0.0
"This place is across the street from my work, so I've been there a lot. Bagels are very good, but not the best I've ever had (for those you have to go to New Jersey!) This place has a nice ambiance and it's a nice place to sit down and do work (they do have some outlets for charging electronics.) Most notably are the variety of cream cheese flavors available, with everything from jalepeno wasabi to fig. They also have a cream cheese flavor of the week, which in the past I've seen vanilla bean, girl scout cookie, nutella, beer cheese, maple, and more! Sometimes they have cool bagel flavors like coconut. 
     The line moves fast and they've only messed up my bagel once. However, once I ordered an open-face bagel half veggie cream cheese, half egg salad- it cost $7.50! That's probably more than an entire bagel with either one of those toppings. Two halves shouldn't add up to more than a whole, you know? 
I recommend getting a mini bagel. They're cheaper and I can never finish a regular sized bagel without feeling sick anyway.",0.0
"I woke up from a night out with a deep, deep hunger that needed to be filled and if it didn't i was going to be sick. so i hopped on seamless and found austin's cafe. it looked very promising and i ordered two paninis. They got there in good time, and i was so hungry and desperate that basically anything would have tasted good to me. i teared open the box like a ravenous malnourished bear in the wilderness and shoved one of the pan inis down my throat. at first bite, it was less than good. it was like 6 layers of thickish ham with a slice of cheese, barely melted. i was disappointed. but i ate it anyway. i moved on to the next and it was just unbearable. it was something chicken, but the chicken was ground. when you grind chicken u better do it right cuz if you dont it doesn't sit well and its just a vomit waiting to happen. austins had potential in their pan inis but they were just so gross. never ordering again.",0.0
"This is my go-to dinner when I don't feel like cooking.  It's cheap ($6) and so good... I could eat this every week (and I have!) and not get sick of it.

"For what it is, The Ainsworth does a pretty darn good job. What is it they do? Well... they're a sports bar for the upscale subset. Sometimes you may be sick of  the cavernous, rudimentary Irish bar with mediocre pub grub, stale Guinness, and bathrooms that'd more fitting for a rest stop off of Highway 95. For those moments when you want to put on your Big Boy Pants and experience some Sunday NFL action like a post-graduate professional, The Ainsworth comes in strong. 

Their food is all well above your average sports bar fare (wings, burgers, etc...), it's clean, there's plenty of room to spread your wings, and you can't look anywhere in the room without spotting a TV. Sure cocktails will run you $16 (as opposed to a $5 vodka drink at a less refined locale), but you're paying for a different experience here. It's not an experience I can justify on a weekly basis, but for the occasional change of pace, it's a nice departure from the norm.

Outside of Sundays you can expect a pretty typical NYC nightlight experience during the rest of the week. Good looking people, occasional haggling/bartering with bouncers at the door, a guarantee you'll drop a couple hundred at the bar, et al. If that's not your scene, you should probably find a different watering hole for your adventures. For those in search of that sort of vibe, you'll be just fine.",0.0
"The worst vegetarian food! Ever. No, come think of it - the worst food ever - vegetarian or carnivorous. 
Every food option looked, tasted and smelled like a bad Chinese takeout that sat in the fridge since last week (which given the disastrous food, most likely was).
For a place that pretends to be vegetarian,  they sure have no respect for plant food. The green beens looked so old and sad, we opted for lo main and quinoa instead. Quinoa was horribly undercooked and stale, while looking lomain was horribly overcooked and stale. Drumsticks were dripping in oil and tasted like tar, while fake chicken was tasteless. 
We decided against their overpriced juices with appetizing names like ""Diahrea"" and ""Constipation "". You are practically guaranteed to experience both if you decide to risk eating the castle food. All they are missing is a drink called ""Vomiting "", which is how you will feel every time you think of this place.
Even vegans would have healthier and more appetizing choices in another castle - the White Castle! 
Given the horrible food, high prices and the fact that the guy behind the counter spoke almost no English,  the place deserves -1 star. But because of yelp limitations and because the place is actually nice looking and a bathroom is clean, a very generous +1 star. 
Btw, while we were there, a couple walked in from the street using another door, and they brought with them takeout from another eatery. Smart! They looked like locals and knew to avoid the castle food. If you think you are smart, you would avoid veggie castle ii like a plague.",0.0
"I only give one star if the food is literally inedible.  Like if it's actually not meant to be eaten.

The falafel was undercooked in a flour tortilla (like a burrito tortilla)- ridiculous.  The food was  also cold to the touch.  The falafel was packed full of lettuce, a few tomatoes, and truly horrible pieces of rubbery falafel.  I ate about half of it and threw it away.  It was the worst falafel I've had in NYC so far, by far.  The tahini sauce literally had no flavor and tasted like if you mixed gelatin with flour and water- I almost gagged tasting it.  All to the trash.

Eggplant salad was horrible.  It was flavorless and had the consistency of mush- like if you smashed up eggplant and left it in a refrigerator for a week.  Took one bite, threw the rest away. I didn't even risk eating the bread, I probably would have broken a tooth.

It's insane how bad this food was.  Wasted $15 for lunch.  Next time I think to do something like this I'm just going to give a homeless person $15 instead- I'll remain hungry but at least I won't be sick and upset.

Never again.

I than see the cook place my pizza on regular flour, without washing his hands. I said something, there was a another guy working there too, who in the past has been nice... He basically looked at me and didn't care at all. I left everything, went to stop and shop and got pizza for us there. MUCH better.

"This is a great place to satisfy any cheesecake craving. My favorite was the Strawberry. There are both full sized cheesecakes as well as mini individual cakes to try as many different flavors as you would like. The mini cheesecakes are perfect in size as they allow you to eat without getting sick of it. However, a downside would be the size of the store. Getting a seat is like war and the space is very cramped. Not exactly the best sit down place for dessert, but I would recommend you pay this place a visit overall.",0.0
"Summer Restaurant Week 2015 - Lunch $25

Appetizers:

- Stracciatella: essentially cheese with a more watery texture than burrata. My sour dough bread was a little too salty and too hard/crunchy. Salsa Verde and plums were pretty scarce and didn't add anything to the dish. Tastes good when paired with the meat balls.

- Polpetti alla venezia (Veal meatballs): melt in your mouth meat balls. Serving size - 5 meatballs. Should be paired with bread to balance out the savoriness of the dish.

Entrees:

- Bucatini (Uni pasta with spicy bread crumbs): had to pay additional market price for this dish. Couldn't tell the uni was smoked. There were several pieces of uni scattered throughout the dish. Bread crumbs were not spicy at all. Noodles were perfectly al dente. The creamy sauce is pretty addicting. The portion is on the smaller size. They should add a little more noodle so the average person is not left feeling hungry. 

- Pollo al limone (chicken with lemon marinade/dressing): crispy skin and tender meat. They give you three large pieces of chicken, 1 drum stick, and not sure what the other two pieces were. However the chicken was WAAAY toooo salty!! My friend had the same issue with her chicken. On top of that, the kale was really salty also. They probably just over salted our dishes since no one else has had any issues. When we got near the bone of the drumstick, the chicken was still raw. Good thing we didn't get food poisoning. =X

Dessert:

- Olive oil cake: texture is similar to corn bread. You can definitely taste the olive oil,  which I liked. It was just more dry than I prefer. They should have put everything on top of the cake instead of to the side and maybe add a little but of whipped cream to give it more moisture. 

- Tiramisu: I love espresso and this was drenched in it! Portion is pretty huge. Best dessert option.

- Bellini Sundae: This was ok. A little on the sweet side. You have to mix everything together to balance it all out. The prosecco made everything melt really quickly and the sundae turned into soup before you were even half way done. 

Service was standard. I would probably only go back for the next restaurant week. It doesn't seem worth it to pay the regular price for the Bucatini. But $25 for lunch or even $38 for dinner is a great deal!!",0.0
"Okay for real the only reason I'm even posting a review is because I had to make an account to review another place for a class.

This place used to be my favorite thing in the city. I was in love, I told every tourist who asked me for directions about it. My Italian suitemate told me it was the closest thing to home she could find. I went so many times all the pasta guys knew me. I used to go when I was having a bad day just so the pasta could cheer me up. I went so many times I had a favorite pasta chef, Antoine. He is incredible. I don't know if you could taste the love your mom put into the hot chocolate she made when you were sick, but Antoine had a way of putting that same love into his dishes. He took pride in his work and always gave me extra tomatoes and basil :). 

Anyways, I went on a trip to London for a month, I came back and the first place I wanted to go was Vapiano to visit Antoine to temporarily cure me from the pain of the sh*t show my trip was. To my horror, he wasn't there. Whatever. I ask the guy making my pasta what day Antoine would be back and he had no idea who I was talking about. This was impossible, everyone knew him. A bus boy told me there was a fight with management and Antoine and 6 others had quit. My heart broke into a million pieces. Every time I have gone back since (this happened a year ago) it's been disappointing. No one cares anymore. They burn the sauce and put like a leaf of basil and one little cherry tomato. All I want is Antoine's cooking. I wish I knew where he went :(",0.0
"I had never heard of this place before a friend took me. We were excited to have ramen at the 'other place' but the wait was an hour and a half for a table. And it was pouring out, with no more standing room inside the foyer. Noooo thanks!

We walked over to Totto in the rain, and were seated almost immediately. The interior was much brighter, which was welcome on a rainy day.

I have to say, I was very very pleasantly surprised. The buns were good, but did not scream out to me.

The ramen broth is where this place really came through for me. I don't know if it's smoother, less salty, or what, but it made me never want to go through another 1-2 hour wait for over-hyped ramen again. Usually I hate the broth because it's too salty and I get sick of it fairly quick, but here, I could have finished the whole bowl.

I have had better ramen, but this is definitely one of my top favorites, well above that other place.

I can't wait to come back, and NOT have to wait until I'm staving to even get seated!",0.0
"If I could give zero stars I would. Went for brunch here since my shakshouka craving kicked in. My friend and I ordered the mediteranean platter which came with pita so hard your teeth chipped ! The coffee was disgusting and even the guy next to me was complaining to someone on his mobile about the offensive coffee - my friend and I burst out laughing as we said this is a sign of things to come - bad food and service! 
An hour later with no entrée I decided to investigate only to be told that my order never reached the kitchen. When the order did arrive it was 2 raw eggs in tomato sauce that was a soup of unappetizing ecoli. My friend's salmon benedict was topped by spoilt mayo another food poisoning hazard! The hostess decided to make up for the poor quality and service by serving us some stale chocolate frozen horrid concoction not worth touching because of all the frost bite we saw and the goey snot like substance drizzled around the plate and center.

I got the American Glob (vanilla ice cream, sea salt, pretzels, whole thing dipped in chocolate, and I opted in for dulce). It was really delicious! Not so cloyingly sweet that I felt sick after - perfectly satisfying!

"I'd like to start off saying I have only ordered take-out for delivery from Ocean, so my review is only based on that.  Delivery time is okay, but during peak dinner-time, (6pm) it took 45 minutes for my food to arrive.  So keep that in mind if you're ordering around that time.  Otherwise, I like that they take credit card over the phone for delivery orders.
The sushi isn't bad; I've never gotten sick off of it, and I can tell the rolls were made to order. 

I've been ordering from them for years, but last night was the first time the delivery guy actually ASKED me for his tip. That kind of turned me off.  I signed off on my credit card order and put a $0 for the tip section because I meant to give him 2 bucks in cash.  But after he asked for it I actually felt like giving him nothing because I felt it was rude to ask, and hey... my food did take 45 minutes to arrive!  (I gave him the $2).",0.0

"Had sushi and spicy rolls here yesterday. I do not recommend it!! Unfortunately. At one point I almost felt sick eating it, too weird ""mushy""and ""fishy"" taste and smell, which again tells me that it wasn't fresh. So disappointing. I actually left 5 rolls. Everything is tiny and small, but in this case I wouldn't have been able to eat a ""normal"" sized piece anyway. My sister had sushi and rolls too and had the same experience. Did NOT like it.

"Mama Pho is not the best pho ever, but very edible and has consistently gotten better. 

The staff is nonchalant, not particularly warm, but they get the job done quickly and I always have food in my face hole in a prompt fashion. Perhaps it's a testament to the west bushwick neighborhood and hipster patrons.  Then again, All the best pho comes from places where the service is aloof and comically efficient. 

Their broth has the richness I look for, the condiments are all there, the meat isn't scary, and despite the reviews of poor standards, I have always been impressed by the consistent quality of ingredients. I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN SICK, EVER. My apt and the restaurant I chef at are conveniently located about 150 feet away, so I eat all sorts of things from here pretty often. Actually, most pho places are cheap and horribly filthy. The price tag here likely reflects the rent of the neighborhood and maintenance of the resto, food quality on up. 

It is very nice they furnish some veggie options, but if you are a vegan/vegetarian, you must be out of your mind or just plain stupid to expect anything from a place named after a dish comprised of a pile of beef parts in celebration of carnivorous glory. I mean, seriously, pho. And they don't even offer tendon and guts for noobs and the squeamish. So there's that. 

Their bahn mi isn't bad, I have tried their salads and liked them alright. They probably keep it fresh because it's a lot of the same dishes/proteins in heavy rotation. But I do keep coming back for the classic pho and the summer rolls.  And even though pho traditionally doesn't transport well, I have only had success with delivery and take-away.   Overall, I am very happy this place exists and it will continue to be my go-to pho fix in the neighborhood.",0.0
"Came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon. Had made reservations, but they weren't required as the place was nearly empty. Decent food including a large variety of salads and vegetables. You should mostly just go for the novelty though, as being brought unlimited meat on a stick can be fun. Who doesn't want to see their friends eat themselves sick? They even keep the place nice and cold in case you start getting meat sweats. Oh, and the cheesy bread is delicious, but desserts and drinks aren't included in the already high prices.

Summary: A bit of a tourist trap, but fun to bring those who've never experienced this type of food before.",0.0
"A friend of mine that goes to Baruch took me here for lunch last week. They have an awesome lunch special for $8 (appetizer and entree). I got my usual: pad see eew. Very delicious. Not as salty as it is at other places, which is great. I don't feel salt sick when I'm done. I also got the shrimp and crap spring rolls for my appetizer and they are AMAZING. Super delicious and you will definitely want more when they're gone. We shared the banana spring rolls with coconut ice cream for dessert and it was enough for us to share without being stuffed at the end. Also very delicious. 

They have a Groupon: $16 for $30 worth of food which is great. I went back a couple of days ago with two friends and used it with no problem. I got the Pad Thai to go. It still tastes very good reheated later on. 

The waiters there are very kind and attentive. They don't stare or judge or rush you out, which is always a great thing. I always feel very welcome when I go there. 

Overall, I most definitely recommend anyone give this place a try. Affordable, delicious thai food in a nice area. I suggest an alternative dessert of bubble tea across the street at Coco :)",0.0
"Really FRESH food. You see all the Punjabi ladies cooking right in front of you. They always serve with gloves on. Everything is freshly made in batches, not pre cooked items from weeks ago. That's why their hot table isn't loaded all the time because food is constantly being made at this joint. No shady kitchen in the back where you have no clue what is going on, everything right out in the open. Their Masala Chai is so good and made in a big old pot! When my mom comes to Jackson Heights to do her spice shopping, she must stop here for their Chai and Samosas. 

I see that some people here on Yelp are commenting on the food being ""bland"" and not as ""spicy"". This is authentic Indian food eaten at home, not the over spiced and unhealthy crap you see in Indian Restaurants all over Manhattan. This food will not give you ""diarrhea"" or stomach pain b/c it's gentle on the stomach, not that gross garbage people call Indian food in tourist traps. I ate at those places a couple of times in Manhattan and have felt sick afterwards. I never got sick from Raja Sweets because all of the food is made fresh daily.

The atmosphere is whatever, it's not the ambiance of a 5 star restaurant with sparkling floors and a smiling waiter to collect tips. It's not a restaurant where everything is beautiful on the outside and only God knows whats going on in the back kitchen. This is a homey, you see what you get, dingy enough to be authentic, fill your tummy up and leave with a smile kind of place. 

Their dinner special is 7 bucks with 2 veggie sides (I like the palak paneer=spinach paneer and the chana masala= spiced chick peas), 1 dal (lentils), rice, and 2 rotis (you can either get it plain or with butter). Their yogurt and spiced pickles (achar) are free and taste great with everything! So don't hesitate to take some in the bowls in the front by yourself! 

I love all their chaats, especially their samosa chaat. Huge portions of chaat for around 4-5 bucks I believe. Their sweets are also really yummy.",0.0
"This is my go-to healthy lunch spot while at work - nothing more, nothing less.

I usually get salads here, but their quinoa bowls are decent too. The variety of options here is what initially attracted me - I never get bored here. Even if I just get salads for the week, they offer a ton of different proteins, so I'm in no danger of getting sick of chicken/chicken/chicken/tuna (sorry coworkers) /chicken/chicken...etc. I've gotten their turkey, tofu (smoked, so it's actually better than the tofu at a lot of salad bars), tuna, falafel, and, yes, chicken.  And as the name suggests, the ingredients do indeed taste pretty fresh. 

Also - the pace could not be better. Considering the volume of hungry corporate bodies that come in here between 12-3, this place is damn efficient. I do have to say that as far as the salad bar is concerned, I think that topping quantity is inversely proportional to speed. These custom-made salads are expensive, and I want my money's worth. I'd honestly prefer a slower pace if it meant getting an adequate amount of each topping, but that's not exactly not the New York way - especially in midtown. I just I really like food and stinginess is not cool. So when the line for the salad bar is shorter, more often than not I get more bang for my buck. The few times I've mentioned perceived stinginess (in less loaded terms, of course), the response has been a bit hostile, but oh well. At the end of the day, I get a nice healthy lunch and I go on with my life.",0.0
"I want to give this place 4-5 stars because the food is typically good. But the reason for my rating is what TAKES AWAY from the overall dining experience.

I usually order the chicken pho if I dine alone. Otherwise, with friends we do the whole Shabu-Shabu thing and it's quite fun. In any case, it's definitely not a formal place... paper napkins and disposable chopsticks, etc.

My PERSONAL experience 2 weeks ago was that I ordered the Large Chicken Pho and about 3/4 into it, I found a piece of hair about an inch to an inch and a half long. Needless to say it was repulsive and I felt sick to my stomach. I tend to not overreact over things like this - people make mistakes - I called the waitress over and she offered me a new one. I was basically not hungry anymore anyway so I said no thank you. She said she would ""adjust the price"" which meant ""not paying"". So I left without having to pay (I wouldnt have even if they asked) and I havent gone back since.

2. shrimp and grits - the first bite of the grits was yummy creamy and good but after a few more bites i realized i was eating what tasted like pure spoonfuls of BUTTER witch i love but this was sooo much my stomach hurt. what made the shimp and grits worthy of only one star? the shrimp were NOT CLEANED!! eeww who wants to eat shimp poop?

"The only reason I'm giving it 1 Star is because, under Yelp's rating system, I have to.  This was, without a doubt, the WORST Chinese food I've eaten in years.  Total Crap.  STAY AWAY.

Once I brushed the flies out if my face so I could see what I ordered...

Fried Dumplings:  Were not ""fried""; they were cremated into hard little balls of burnt turds that practically caused me to lose a couple of teeth.  All  heavily salted, burnt dough and no pork.  Disgusting.

Garlic Chicken:  Awful.  First off, the food was 99.9% soggy vegetables and 1% meat.  And much of the meat was still cold (!!!) -- should I take a taxi to Lenox Hill Hospital to get my stomach pumped and get some shots?   Second, this was the first time that a main Chinese course I got had too much burnt grease.  Totally awful.

Fries are big and meaty and filling. Plenty greasy, but not swimming in a pool either, which made me happy. My standby sauces are the lemon dill, horseradish, parmesan pepper, and roasted garlic.

The truth is Bud's wasn't paying their bills, we had mountains of past due notices from Con Ed, our cable provider, our beer distributors, and our food providers, and on top of that had to deal with poor management decisions. You probably won't get that version in your local paper, nor will be status remain up that long if they're checking. However we would like you all to know that for some of us Bud's was second home, some of us formed hopefully life-long friends, and we all loved Bud's as much as some of you did at the beginning but realized that the path it was going down wasn't our exactly what we wanted to be apart of. We apologize for the obnoxiously loud club music that blasted in your ears while you all tried to eat your dinner and watch your game. We also apologize for the underage teenagers who came in the last weeks and ruined your Bud's experience entirely. We appreciate those of you who stuck by and came in to give us multiple chances or would simply come back just to see a familiar face and grab a drink with us. We turned trashy & believe me we know it.

For those of you who miss your regular favorite bartenders and servers they can found close to home at really awesome bars!! Make sure you check out these bars: The new bar Snowdonia on 34-55 32nd street! Ovelia's 34-01 30th Ave!

Thanks to everyone who always tipped us appropriately and made our days & nights worth while! As for the rest of you, if you can't afford to tip then stay home!!!

We all really did try to be everyone's friend at Bud's! :)",0.0
"I have been to empire biscuit 3 times over its short life. A lot of waiting around for inconstant biscuits:

1. Eat your biscuit immediately because they don't keep well - On a Thursday morning I got a butter and grape jam on country biscuit for me and arugula fennel butter country biscuit for my coworker. No line for ordering and it took between 5 - 10 minutes for me to get 2 fresh out of the oven. Ate mine on the walk to the subway and it was delicious. My coworker was out sick so I ate her's an hour later and it was gross. The biscuit dried out and had no taste.

2. This place cannot handle lines, go for the all butter biscuit - Went with friends on a Saturday morning. Maple butter and fig jam on all butter biscuit was good, I could not taste the maple though. I definitely prefer all butter. My friends highly recommended the sandwich with fried chicken. The iPad and credit went down while we were next up on line. The cashier could not handle it and got very anxious and the kitchen sat idle for 5 minutes as no orders poured it. Once he took our orders by hand we got our food immediately since 8 people had nothing to do. Everybody behind us was pretty screwed waiting in line for what I imagine would be at least 20 minutes.

3. I think they pre bake their biscuits at night and you risk getting the dry tasteless ones - went at 11 PM on a Saturday and got a Kiki and maple, grape both on all butter.  Spent 6 minutes (timed it) in a 3 person but the food came quicker than my first trip. Nothing impressive about these. My roommate had half of each for the first time and agreed they were nothing special. 

I may be back because I live pretty much above the place and it's convenient, but it's nothing to go out of your way for.",0.0
I recently came here with a group. Was a terrible experience. Wish I had never set foot in this place. It seems to attract the lowest common denominator of people. Felt sick to my stomach due to some of the crowd there and how the people were acting. The people working there didn't seem to care.,0.0
Don't take your vegetarian friends here. The veggie burger is awful. 2 stars instead of one because it's edible and won't make you sick. But that's about all it's got going for it.,0.0
"I had many primi-secondi experiences in Roma, which I thought would be the be-all, end-all Italian dining experience of a lifetime. I was up nights lamenting the fact that it would never, ever happen again.

Then I went to Babbo's.

Quick backstory: I was on a supremely regimented nutritional healing regiment for months to tackle some health issues. Issues tackled. I was on a dairy/caffeine/alcohol/nightshade/gluten/meat/spice/spicy/JOY-free diet for many months. They were good months, and mission accomplished.

Once accomplished, I switched my game to ""happy, wholesome"" foods. After so many months, I planned a blowout meal at Babbo with my family. I'd waited years to eat here.

They did NOT disappoint. In fact, it rated one of the top five meals of my life.

Everything. Was. PERFECT. Seriously. My dear father (whom I dragged along on this venture, god bless him) said to me before we ate anything, ""I'm going to get the veal. That's really the tell-all of a restaurant: it's usually dried out.""

Having dined at Mono years prior and seen nirvana in a luncheon (one of the top five, too), I bit my cheek and waited for the food to arrive.

Seriously, everything was to die for. Absolutely. In fact, ambling sideways home with top pants button undone, I floated. I shouldn't have floated. I was so stuffed with the things I'd eschewed for months and in an embibed quantity I've never achieved in a lifetime, I should have rolled. But my SOUL was fed here.

The atmosphere, the service, the food...my GOD, the FOOD...was all phenomenal.

This included a post-meal strawberry basil grappa, which as a former Manhattan mixologist and anti-sweet-hater, I initially was skeptical of, but it was PHENOMENAL. Seriously. (I've said that so many times already I'm sure you no longer believe me. But there aren't any more superlatives left that are adequate for the thing.)

Not only was the beverage incredible, but it, as a digestif, helped me button the pants (lord the pain) and get back home.

I. Am in love. With this food. I don't do it every day, or even every week or month or year or lifetime, but I went for broke on the menu and this is what I had:

Marinated Fresh Sardines with Caramelized Fennel and Lobster Oil  $12:
            You might think three sardines on a plate are not worth $12. You might 
            think sardines are icky. You are thinking wrong. Trancendent. And        
             caramelized fennel? My new boyfriend.

Maccheroni alla Chitarra with Oven Dried Tomatoes, Red Chilies and Bottarga di Muggine  $20
            Let me tell you why you need bottarga in your life: THIS DISH. 

Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads with Sweet and Sour Onions, Duck Bacon and Membrillo Vinaigrette  $29
            I know, I know, great meal and such, I should have no qualms. The
            takeaway: the sweetbreads (thymus gland) were perfectly cooked. It
            is HARD to cook them well. The duck bacon was sick and clever. Fennel
            dust? Not something I'd EVER lose to a cloth and Pledge. It could have,
             pardon me for saying it as I am not Batali, used more sour component,
            and possible more salt. It had four out of five senses engaged. But still
            gorgeous.

Babbo greens and rapini contorni
            I could eat either of these for every meal for the rest of my life. The green
            and bitter components are essential to cutting the fat of the rest of the         
            meal.

Saffron Panna Cotta with Apricot Agrumata and Saffron Shortbread $13
            I AM NOT A SWEET PERSON. THIS WAS THE BEST DESSERT OF MY
            LIFE. The Panna Cotta was perfectly tempuratured and creamy and the
             zing of the apricot and crunch of the shortbread made me wonder why
            I am not a sweet person.

And of course the grappa. A must-do for anyone who ate all the things I just listed (and I tasted my co-diners' food as well: highlight of which were the funghi trifolati and veal. I don't do veal. I was chewing on the bone by the end of the night and I don't do bread and I was sopping up my father's funghi sauce before the main course came).

Everything they do is a delight to the taste buds. It was a true win for the bucket list. Thank you, Mario; thank you. I've been a huge fan before FN and since Molto Mario and I love you. Forever. Thank you.",0.0
"CLOSED! I have been going there for over 15 years - it was called Venus restaurant until about a year ago. Always one of my favorite diners. However, on my last visit they served me some nasty old chicken with my pasta. I thought it was a fluke and sent it back. Ordered chicken fingers. Again - nasty old rubber chicken. It nearly made me sick after the first bite. I couldn't believe it. The waiter just stared at me with a blank look - like I was making it up. I had to tell him to take it away and take it off my bill. A few days later is was closed. Sign is the window says For Rent. Buh bye.",0.0

It tastes like sick-rice the same one you eat when you are with diarrhea.
Expensive too! $4 just for that? Anyway, f won't come back...",0.0
"Decided to try this place out after reading all the yelp reviews. Huge disappointment. 
This place used to be another Xi'an famous foods serving the same cuisines. So I ordered the cold noodles, wonton, and lamb cumin noodles as they were my regular dishes from XFF. Lady behind the register scribbled my order down on a notepad. A chef behind her cooking, and a younger lady to the side handling the skewers.
I must have waited 15 min for them to get the food to me, in the process repeating my order over 5 times, the older lady is highly unorganized and seems to be slowing down the pace of the chefs. 
What I found hilariously disgusting was that they were cooking on one hot plate, a rice cooker and a microwave all infested with gunk, very very unappetizing to watch. 
A good 10 orders came out with the skewers before they finally got my orders ready, and the skewer girl had to help me pack.
Needless to say, some staffs are just inefficient. 
Getting home and eating them, the food were just inedible flavorless. I would come back and try their skewers another time. But I would not recommend any of their entrees unless you want to risk getting food poisoning",0.0
"I don't know what you guys are smoking! The food was terrible! I have been to many Filipino restaurants in NYC including Long Island and this restaurant ranked last in my book!

I hope I don't get sick from their dinuguan because it tasted horrible. Even though it is close to home, I rather drive to Woodside or Long Island. Never going here again! $16 for their buffet?

The majority of them are not designed to be modern looking and the food isn't great so I don't get how you can give this place a low rating unless you find a band-aid in your food or something or you got severe food poisoning.  This is a fast food joint and is not meant to look nice.  

Anyway, I wanted to review this place since I was thirsty and decided to come here for their sweet tea!  This location has the new soda machines where you can mix and match flavors.  Score!  My type of machine.  This locaiton has been here for a long time and I'm glad it's still there since it's in a good location.",0.0
Interested in trying new places I decided to stop into Swagat. I ordered the mild shrimp curry and ended up throwing it away because the shrimp was over cooked & the curry was sweet.

I recommend coming here if you're looking for a good food poisoning scare. The staff was very nice though.,0.0
"The beer here is fresh, tasty and clean, the flatbread is great, and the space is ideal for a night out. However, what wonky service! Seriously inconsistent to the point of me wondering if someone slipped the waitstaff something before their shifts. The first time I came here--three waitresses called in sick and we waited maybe 30 minutes between beers. Second time, just slow. Third time, the waitress looks like she's about to cry, ignores us, and when I chase her down for the check she confronts me, saying, ""I heard you.""

I like their red bean desserts. It's a $1 each.

"Although it was a little too cold to be hanging outside drooling over the 75 food vendors' various offerings, we managed and were glad we did.

Almost everything we tried was amazing. I have no idea how these vendors maintain such excellent quality while cooking outside under a tent. 

Pizza Moto - nearly perfect. I tried the white pizza with grilled Brussels sprouts. I think I would have enjoyed a red pie a bit more, but the quality of the crust and the ingredients cannot be beat. They cook on a mobile coal fired oven that maintains a perfectly even 800° temperature. They were great guys who were willing to sit around and discuss the moisture content of the dough being the secret to a crispy exterior and chewy interior crust. I loved them and their fabulous pizzas and if I ever have the opportunity I will be back for more. 

Milk Truck - breakfast grilled cheese sandwich:  this sandwich included two fried eggs, caramelized onions and thick slices of cheddar cheese for a perfectly melted treat. I substituted the rosemary bread for the Rye that the sandwich typically comes on and I'm so glad I did. The rosemary bread had significant flavor on its own but after being brushed with a sick layer of butter and grilled it was amazingly decadent and delicious. The only thing that could have made it better is something vinegary or spicy. I borrowed a spicy mustard from one of my friends meals and added it. Amazing. 

Handsome Hank's fish and chips: so good it called to me, a vegetarian, to try it. I've never eaten seafood so I'm not sure what type of fish it was but it was large chunks of beautifully battered, crunchy fried fish. The tartar sauce was perfect and even the fries were great. 

Queen Cobra Thai massaman curry: interesting composition, nice flavors, but not the best food I ate at this market. They start with a layer of mashed potatoes in the bottom of the bowl, then layer on onions and carrots, pour over the curry and top it with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. The peanuts added a texture that I did not care for, but it was still really good and the roti fried in butter fresh in front of you is awesome. 

I'm not sure of the vendors' name but two of my friends ate tuna tartare tacos and thought they were the most amazing thing that they'd ever eaten. 

The only disappointment of the day for me was the Mexican hot chocolate stand. If it's 35° and windy out and I pay six dollars for a cup of hot chocolate I expect it to be hot, not room temperature / slightly cool.",0.0
"Really disappointing.
I try very hard to avoid writing not good reviews.
However, I am feeling compelled to write about Saul.  I would hope that the management reads these and perhaps take heed.  If not, perhaps I can at least spare someone else a very disappointing experience.

So, what is wrong with Saul?
In order of how problematic.

The service is SO confused and overwhelmed.  The staff don't seem to know where to go or what to do: server tells us she can't find table because they changed numbers; waitress is running around, as if lost without GPS, and she seems to purposefully ignore all of us because she can't keep up.; maitred d fills water glasses since he seems to realize that nothing is running smoothly, but he can't do anything else to fix it.

The meal takes over 2 hours, and it isn't a leisurely time since most of it is spent waiting to be asked what we want, waiting for the food to arrive, waiting for the drinks to come...waiting.  It feels as if one is stuck on the subway with a sick passenger ahead.  

The portions are so small it is stingy, and dishes aren't cheap, so it leaves one feeling ripped off.  For example: chicken breast, price $28.  2 ounces of chicken at most and a 1/2 ounce of  sausage (chicken I think).  Really, I am not exaggerating.  The rest of the plate contained: 1 stuffed mushroom, 2 skinny carrots (think no. 2 pencils), 4 tablespoons of mashed potatoes and some sauce.  Yes, $28.

Perhaps even worse than the small portions is the really spotty quality of the food.  I had the white bean soup.  I think they must have run out of the real stuff and sent someone to the bodega for Campbells Cream of Mushroom.  Then they smashed up some beans and brought me a bowl of gritty canned soup with some nice mushrooms and green oil on top.  
The chicken was very tasty, as were the little morsels it was served with.  However the potatoes were cold (cold mashed potatoes--argh).  On the upside, my dinner companion had scallops and she said they were amazing.  Finally after sitting forever,  it was time for the famous Baked Alaska: so overly sweet and unsophisticated, cloying.  Overbake a chocolate cookie, top with quickly thrown together mousse (splash with rum and don't mix through) and then bake some meringue on top; don't forget to put a ton of sugary caramel on the plate too.  
At least the coffee was good.

Saul needs to get organized.  High end dining where small portions feel elegant, requires seamless service and impeccable food.   While they try to figure things out, perhaps they should keep us happy with some generosity: skip those Arnold dinner rolls and give us some hearty good bread in a basket; if you are having a really bad night, give us a little cheese, some olives; bring sorbet between courses.  And if we are going to have to wait so long, make the wait worth it with exceptional food.",0.0
Absolutely disgusting.  If I had not been so hungry I would not have eaten anything.  I choked down the rubber shrimp with a cocktail sauce that had to be at least a year old.  The French onion tasted like a toxic bouillon soup with no onions.  I was burping that diarrhea tasting soup for 48 hrs.  Needless to say I will not be returning.,0.0
"I'm not the sort of person who delights in giving bad reviews: Say something nice or nothing at all, and all that. But Symposium merits some special, and choice, commentary. For both my partner and myself, this was the single worst meal we've had in a restaurant in a decade. We were reminded of how food in this country used to be before the foodie revolution. How food was in the UK before their foodie revolution. Greasy, stale, etc. If the vegetables, the peas especially, came from anywhere other than a can, I'd be astonished. They had that leached, institutional-food taste. While the portions were large, what use is that if you don't want to eat 'em?

There's a nice, low-key vibe to the place and the wait staff seemed nice. These are pluses. Also: we didn't get food poisoning.",0.0
"I never use Yelp anymore, I signed up once and forgot.
This place is so very bad. Goods that last years are expired. I got Low Fat mayo and when I got home and got sick the next day saw it actually expired almost a year before. Yogurt, eggs, milk, bread. All on the the last day or a few days expired. It should not be this way. I got sour cream that was just up to date but must have not been refrigerated the whole time. It smelled so bad and black when opened I had to double bag it and toss it. No great specials and I miss and now have to walk to keyfoods where I used to go when I lived closer.
Really just upset because it is so close to my house and I don't shop at places like whole foods. I want a regular nice basic grocery store.",0.0
"I LOVE TIBETAN MOMOS!

I grew up eating this delicious juicy flavorful momos at weddings, birthday parties and graduation parties. At any celebration event!. Haha. 

Whenever I come to New York, I did live here for a while. I always get my momos from here or also Gangjong kitchen right across the street! If you want  juicy Tibetan momos go there! I've tried the others around the area and I'm not impressed. I'm also picky with food. If I tried it once and you fail, I won't come back. Ive tried both places multiple of times and always satisfied! If you like spicy be sure to get the hot sause! 

Most I've had to wait was 7 to 10 mins but honestly, I rather wait for a good hot fresh batch anyways. Eat as soon as possible that's when the juices and flavors will treat your taste buds right! :)

I've tried this new momo stand in Milwaukee,it was nepali style was super excited to try it but was very disappointed and too undercooked it made my friend sick! It was a fail!  So people of new York take advantage of the great momos you get there! cause some people here are missing out!",0.0

They have great location, great service, and great food and drinks. 

I've tried their mince and cheese + shepherd's pie, and it's complete heaven for someone like me who loves savory food. the pies are very flavorful and the pie crust has consistently been baked perfectly.

If you haven't tried their flat white, please do. It's super smooth and the guy who made it for me made a cute leaf design. I told him I shouldn't be drinking espresso because I was sick, but he told me (correctly) that flat whites have a really smooth texture. It also helps that the guy who works there on Wednesday mornings reminds me slightly of Hugh Laurie.

Cesar is THE best bartender in town hands down (and I've tried my share).  Not only does he have the brightest attitude but he gave me a delicious tequila based drink and made me wonder if he had magical hands! (I normally can't even smell tequila because it makes me sick but here I savored the drink and loved it!) then I got a weird concoction with aloe and cucumber and was ready for a beautiful plate of ribs.  But before we go there, why not snack on fried crickets? As adventurous I am, I hesitated but after Cesar's drinks I had to trust him and went for them, not bad, crunchy and a little spicy they made me feel brave and hungry for some good meat.  The meat melted in my mouth and we garnished the dish with some lemony black ants! Crazy fun experience, delicious food and a new friend in Cesar, he is the main reason why I would go back, the atmosphere the staff creates is what one needs after work in NY.

"Be prepared for a decent wait if you're planning on visiting Caracas around dinner time, but, the earlier you come the less likely you will have to wait for an extended amount of time.

My friend and I shared a guacamole and three arepas and trust me, this was more than enough to fill us both.  I would recommend getting one arepa per person and sharing because we were beyond stuffed and a bit sick, if I'll be honest, of arepas.  

The guacamole is a solid choice here, but again, a lot for two people to handle.

Friend and I shared a pork, chicken, and beef arepa - couldn't tell you exactly which ones, but I'm sure they are all just as tasty as the ones we had (I know that's really useful information right there...).  All the meats were juicy and very well seasoned.  Arepas were cooked to perfect and very hot on arrival into our very anticipating hands.

"Used to love coming to this place when it was still at the old spot on Classon. It was no fuss, quick and the food was delicious. Can't say the same for the new location. Went there for brunch, service was terrible both at the bar and at the table. The bartender ignored us for a good 20 minutes before we could order our coffee while we waited for our table. It took more than 30 mins for our food to come and all the sides came way before our main dishes. Food was not bad but not worth the wait. To top off, something was definitely contaminated with gluten and made my friend who has gluten allergy really sick. Won't come back any time soon.",0.0

For appetizer we got the Gyu-Kaku Salad, which has this amazing miso mustard dressing. MMM.. my mouths watering thinking of it.
For meat we tried the:
- Toro Beef
- Premium Rib Eye Steak

"By far one of the worst places for Chinese food. I have an iron stomach (never had food poisoning in my life), so the fact that I had a bad stomach ache after this is a sign. 

General Tsao chicken was SWIMMING in grease, and the chicken was very poor quality. Greasy and soggy. It wasn't crispy. Dumplings tasted old and like they weren't cooked all the way. I don't even know where these dumplings came from but they were just... not good. Especially the veggie and chicken ones. The pork ones were palatable. The fortune cookie was flat out STALE.

The only decent items were the brown rice and plain salad. Hard to mess those up?

Will say that the dinner deal is a good deal though-- for around $11 plus tax you get an entree, rice, soup, and a salad.

Maybe it was just an off night?",0.0
"This place is amazing to party with the right company but there are some downfalls that outweigh all the the fun things here. First off, for a guy to pay $40 at the door is ridiculous. Knowing the promoter here will give you a discounted rate at 30 but still....Nevertheless, I gotta admit the music and the atmosphere (lights) here are pretty sick. You can really have a good time here, drinking and dancing.

However, since this is a basement lounge, the subwoofers in all corners are way too loud and no one in any groups can hear one another. Our ears were still ringing the next morning. On top of everything, the drinks are so damn pricey that it'll make anyone think twice if they want to get wasted here without pregaming.

On the brighter note, if you're a girl and your date/man is paying for you, take the free ride and enjoy the night cuz this place is sick to drink and dance to some amazing tunes. Guys on the other hand, with a heavy heart my friends, be prepared to pay that big fat check you'll expect to see that night.",0.0
"Rude rude rude!!!  My daughter was in the hospital recovering from brain surgery and she was craving a chocolate shake and fries.  She ordered the ""American fries""
Through Grubhub and I asked them to use waffle fries.  What we received was PLAIN waffle fries.  No big deal (or so I thought) I would just call and ask them to take them off our bill.  A rude man answered the phone and in a thick foreign accent, he yelled at me and even called me ""baby""  UGH!!   A little while later, Spiro, the manager, called me back and assured me they would take care of me the next time and said he really wanted to do something special for my sick child  I called 2 days later to give them a try again and I got a rather rude man on the phone.  I had to tell him several times to call Spiro to get something taken off the bill.  After insisting an arguing with me, he called back and they took $16 off of my bill (it was around $70).  Not bad but they could have been more friendly.  They didn't do anything ""special either.  My food was below average but shakes and desserts are delicious.  The fruit salad was pretty decent but the burger was weird - tasted like ashes.  I won't be ordering from them again.",0.0
"This is the TRUTH! 

My husband and I already eat very well and are experienced in juice cleanses but this one is something else (in great way). We needed to detox after the Holidays and we could not have chosen a better cleanse. 

The fact that you don´t consume all that sugar and get to eat a soup at night is wonderful. I usually get very nauseous by the afternoon on regular juice cleanses but never felt sick on this one! 
Everything tastes great (including the protein shakes which kept our muscle tone) so definitely give it a try!
Of course, every cleanse is tough and you need to get over that initial ""withdrawal phase"" but after, you feel amazing! Biggest ""take-away"" is that I felt like I finally had time again. Time did not and still does not (3 weeks after) fly. I feel like I can relax and ease into the day!",0.0
"Normally, I'd give Artichoke something higher than a 1 star review, but after a recent really bad experience there, I can't.  
Late last Saturday night, my friends and I stopped for a slice of pizza there.  Big line, as always.  There was also a lot of unpleasant drama with some douche-bag skipping line and then some girl and guy trying to convince him of what a horrible person he was for doing that (he was directly behind me and didn't budge as far as I could tell).  I'm too old to stand in line with a bunch of drunk idiots, but, we committed to getting a slice ... so, finally, when we get up there, my friend orders 3 slices for us to make it easier for the workers.  Almost immediately, he gives us our margarita slices in a box. In a mad dash to get the f*ck out of there, we rushed away.  We headed for the train before opening the box - lo and behold, we realized that the Artichoke workers hadn't bothered to warm our slices. Seriously, they were ice cold.  
If it wasn't for all the drunk idiots and long line, I would have returned and demanded my money back.  I don't care how busy a place is, there is absolutely NO excuse to serve people who have been waiting in line that long cold pizza. They really should be embarrassed for such poor service. 
I will never return to this overhyped dump.
Honestly, the pizza isn't all that anyway. The artichoke slices are so rich they make you sick.",0.0
"So I came today at around 4:15 pm and boy was I super disappointed with this place.  Long story short, I eagerly came in and left with frustration and my stomach turned upside down.  I was actually planning to come here for ages and it was much anticipated and I was also so excited to come here today and then... 

So when I came there was no wait and it was pretty empty since it was the middle of the day (there were like 6 tables maybe?).  The hostess sat my bf and I down and I asked if we can sit near the place with the long couches instead of in the middle where the tables are smaller and my bf and I wanted to sit next to each other.  However, she told me they were going through shift change so I understood and said ok and sat down where she told me to.  Then, a couple of minutes later (less than 5) she sat 2 guys down where my bf and I wanted to sit.  The terrible experience started from here.  We waited about 15 minutes and we still had no one to bring us water or take our order or anything.  We saw that the table that sat down after us in the seats that we wanted get their water and order their food before the waitress even came to our table.  LIKE HELLO WE WERE HERE FIRST... During the time, we tried to waive down 2 waiters and one did not respond and one said he will get the waitress responsible for our table and our waitress didn't come for another like 10 minutes.  Finally after a 20 minute wait we finally got to order and finally got some water after she left and put our order in.  It was quick for the food to come we just ordered thin fries with a truffle burger to share because I had a snack before coming since my bf gets off late.  I thought we were supposed to get dipping sauces with our fries, however when we asked the waiter for some sauce he only brought us some ketchup.  At this point I was beyond disappointed.

Now for the taste of the food I give it probably a 3 (and its averaged from my bf giving the food a 3.5/5 and 4 max).  We both agreed that the truffle burger was good - very flavorful (but he had higher ratings, maybe because he was starving?)  I personally thought that the truffle sauce was a bit too greasy.  Though I did like the flavor, I was not fond of the grease and the meat itself was not really top quality (you can tell from the texture).  The thin fries were bland (maybe because I was upset about the sauce).  But, I did like the crunchy texture and thinness that it possessed.

After the experience here I have to say, customer service is the most important part of any experience, whether it be dining or a stay at the hotel or a spa.  For me, I'm not sure if the customer service was what killed the taste of all the food for me and made me feel that the money spent was wasted because I just felt so sick while eating there and after I ate there I still felt an upset stomach and plenty of frustration.  Don't get me wrong, the staff weren't NOT friendly, but I don't think they are very helpful.  Maybe this establishment lacks efficient customer service?  But, for a brand that is so well developed and well-known I would expect a lot more.  Now would I recommend my friends to come here?  Probably a Maybe Go if they were dying to try it.  But, if they have never even heard of this place and asked me where to go for a good burger bite around the city?  This place would not be on my list.  Would I ever come back here?  Probably a maybe, but I highly doubt it.  There are plenty of other burger joint gems around so why would I choose to come to a place that leaves me feeling negative and the meal leaves my stomach feeling sick?",0.0
"I do not even know where to begin with my love for Jane.

1. They are SO accommodating with food allergies. I'm a major pain in the you know what and they are always all ""no problem!"", ""we can handle it!"", and ""we actually DO know what gluten is! totally!"" And that makes me feel safe and loved and taken care of. I'm super sensitive Celiac and I've never gotten sick.

2. The food. YUM. Anything. On the menu. Off the menu. Specials. 

3. Service. See #1 above. But they are all great. Also, every time you take the tiniest tiny sip of water, you can just sit there and watch it, and it will magically rise. I don't know how those men with the water pitchers are so sneaky.

I have been here on dates, with out of town guests, on Valentine's Day's, with parents, for brunch, for dinner, and that may be it. But whatever the occasion, Jane fits the bill.",0.0
My friend and I visited this place on a Friday evening. Very cute setting and friendly staff pulled us in. We ordered drinks and food. I had a margarita that tasted like alcohol poisoning at first sip so I traded that in for a sangria. It was better. Food was blaaah. I wasn't impressed with my steak at all. It was over cooked :-( their empanadas were great though. It was a little pricey. I doubt I'd return,0.0
"If you're having a hard, stressful week, need a non-alcohol related activity to meet up with friends/family etc. or are looking to soothe your soul during frigid NYC winters -- get to David's Tea STAT. I am not even a huge tea person, but visiting David's totally converted me. Walked in as someone who occasionally sips Green Tea when everyone around me at work is sick, walked out with two adorable tea mugs and a nut tea soy latte that tasted like freakin' heaven. They have a HUGE wall of teas - seriously anything you could possibly want. From really heavy smokey teas to dessert teas like birthday cake (with sprinkles!). I love how they have a little compartment won all the tea containers where you can smell and even touch the ingredients of the teas to really gets  feel for the flavors.

MangoSeed facts: 
1. Can't sit until entire party arrives (so you could stand at the hostess podium or wait outside like we did)
2. Bar gets crowded quite quickly on the weekends
3. If they take your food order and more ppl arrive at a later time they can only order drinks (This info was volunteered btw)
4. The best and strongest mixed drink they have is the Hennessy Honey Cocktail (whenever friends order other drinks they taste ""light"")
5. DJ/music is inconsistent (the music was great the first time and this time around not so much)

Food Review
I ordered the coconut fried chicken which tasted really good, but I truly enjoyed the savory mash & refreshing cabbage. The crunchy texture complements the mash significantly. I could eat an entire plate of that cabbage in a salad. My dessert was the mango cheesecake which was scrumptious and I can eat a slice of that any day of the week.
My friend ordered the jerk wings which came with a pineapple mango dip that is absolutely amazing!
The trio Mac was full of flavor, but I'm not a big fan of Mac n cheese without the 'baked'. For you easy mac lovers or likers, this is right up your alley. 
Lastly, another friend had the MangoSeed Burger which she said was really good, but she couldn't finish it (probably because the piece of beef was so hefty). I had a fry or few and those were really good! Gotta love house-cut and they were crunchy which made them delicious without the ketchup.",0.0
"I stopped going here after the chef was handling my food with contaminated gloves. He handled raw beef and then proceeded to make my chicken sandwich, etc..

"This is the most splendid restaurant...if you don't care about food or money.

Will your out of town friends be totally impressed with your ability to get into a sick looking place last minute on Friday night?  Damn right they will, and the decor of the place is not to be skipped over, its mastered the correct blend of hip meatpacking night club with elements of my grandmother's farmhouse in China.  Modern with vibrant colors, yet its got the same wood work and vases as grandma's house.

The problem with this place is that the food looks beautifully plated and I want to believe it will be just as tasty as it's presented.  But its amazing how they can make such beautiful plates yet manage to suck out all the flavor and replace it with subpar fake chinese takeout restaurant quality flavor.  If they kept the same venue and replaced everything with Panda Express I might have 3 stared the place.

But my biggest gripe was the last time I went with a large group.  The waiter asked if we would like to split the appetizers so that everyone in our group could get a piece.  Who would say no to that?  And what a surprise it was, we got all this extra food!!  Too bad we ended up paying some ridiculous ""extra add on"" fee.  Come on, I thought this was a classy restaurant, not some used car dealership from hell.

TL;DR: 
Everything looks cool, but the menu might have more taste than the food, and you'll be shaken down for money similar to how a crackhead would treat my piggybank.",0.0
"Alrighty. I've never been a burger fan. It just doesn't excite me the idea of a ground meat patty laying in bed between two breads, pour special sauce on it, put the blanket of lettuce and tomato and call it lunch and/dinner.  And be hungry 30 mins later. 

But then I see this undying long lines everytime I passed Madison Square Park and then I learned about this whole world of Burger as a culinary art. It peaked my curiosity,  not my appetite.  so I have been postponing to try this place until my friend dragged me in a bitter cold of November to join the casuality of that long line and the war over tables & chairs. To be honest, the line moves quickly and with patience one can find a table. It ain't starbucks. People will leave after devouring those monsters. 

Ordered Shack Stack (a burger with the meat & the portobello mushroom) so I can taste both worlds. Friend ordered one with bacon and fries with cheese. Verdict: great hangover food - its fatty, salty, fatty, & salty. And I guess NYC must-eat at. Once.

The deep-fried mushroom is crunchy & has a cheese inside. Just imagine my horror:
 Cheese = Salt = poor my kidneys. *jug on water for a week. Nothing special with the Fries & Cheese. Use the $3.25 to add an extra meat patty. The meat is thin and I personally ordered it rare; why no med-rare!!! I'm afraid medium becomes well-done. Overcook meat = hard&dry meat. Not good. Me a lazy chewer. T'was a burger experience.

"All I can say about this place, is I will NEVER go back even if I was starving. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch. While I ordered a burger that was too small for its high price, my boyfriend had cooked salmon and veggies. While he was enjoying his salmon I noticed a nasty black long string of HAIR!!!!! Disgusting. My boyfriend isn't the type to complain but I called over the owner and he immediately took it away and gave him a fresh new salmon. That was enough for me, until I noticed a fruit FLY swimming in my soda. I called my waitress over and made her look at it, and asked her if that looked like a fruit fly and she agreed and ran to her boss and told him. Her boss (the owner) offered me a new soda, ""free of charge"" I wasn't looking for free food , just clean food. I had it with that place even after the owner had the nerve to tell me there are no fruit flies in the diner..... Uhm there's one right in my soda. Sick to my stomach. DO NOT

The grilled chicken with tequila sauce is outstanding as well as the fried chuleta with tamarindo sauce. I had the cecina (salted steak cut thin and grilled) but would not recommend it. It didnt taste fresh.  I didnt get sick from it, but there was just something not right with it. Overall mostly good.  One exception is the so called tres leches cake for dessert. Although some variation is to be expected region to region, this cake was not even a distant third cousin of tres leches.  Stick with their homemade flan for dessert.

"For many years i've had high hopes for the jamaica location and businesses. As soon as I saw The Moda being built I wondered what other businesses would they put near by. Applebees is a great start for the neighborhood but City Rib is definitely a way better choice. The staff is amazing. I've been here several times and every time has been a pleasant one. My first experience here was a nervous one because i'm gluten intolerant and know that bbq and gluten free doesnt really match. The staff was extremely friendly as well as the manager. He took the time to come to me and speak about the menu as well as to apologize for not having an allergy menu. ( I completely understood because a lot of business don't have one). The few times after that were as equally informational and pleasant. I of course ordered salad every time because although they have told me what I could possibly eat, I really don't want to get sick just in case of cross contamination. They have a jazz night on the weekends which is definitely very refreshing. Live music, great staff, and amazing food is definitely worth taking a trip to the jamaica area.

"Before Baidu, Little Sheep, Little Lamb, or any of the hotpot places I've gone..this was my first Shabu experience outside of home. 

This place is great when you're sick because you get your own pot. your germs stay in your pot, and not anybody else. You order by meals or sets which includes a pot of soup (additional charge for different flavors) and a small plate of meat, seafood, or both. There's a sauce station on both the lower area and main floor for convenience. Everything in the sauce station are fresh and always filled, so nothing runs out. 

The portions that they give out is a little bit more smaller than most places, but I'm not complaining much because most of their things are super fresh and clean. The service is also on point. They always fill your pot with soup when it gets low. 

It's a great place to take first timers because they can get a feel of it and it's not as pricy as AYCE and a la carte places like Little Lamb.",0.0

They are really meticulous about preparing food abiding by your food allergies though. Must give hats off to that; my sister is gluten sensitive and prefers this place because she's never gotten sick from cross-contamination.

"Gluten Free Avenger here with a great GREAT place to come if you're GF or if you have GF friends!  This place really rocks!  It has an assortment of GF options including the usual fare of GF pasta.  However, they have some unusual plates as well, one of which is the gnocchi which I ordered and is TO DIE FOR!!!!  Don't even START, this sh!t'll blow your azs outta the water!  

First off, the appetizer bread with olive oil and ""something white"" is excellent.  Not just sliced up piece of Udi's bread, but baked on premises focaccia type of bread that is UNfrikkinBELIEVABLE!!!  It's been so long since I've had good hot bread and olive oil.  I think like 8 yrs since I had to go GF.  So good.  I think this dish would please your non-GF friends as well.  

They have a good gluten free beer which I've forgotten the name of but which was good!  

The gnocchi was amazing!  I tried making GF gnocchi at home but it like dissolved or something?  But theirs was perfect just like gnocchi should be.  And it was topped with semi-carmelized cheeses of several varieties.  While I was eating it, I was all ""you gotta savour and remember this experience!""

The pistachio ice cream was pretty freaken good and the GF biscotti they had to go with it was not sandy at all and very tasty.  I wouldn't've known it was GF (like the entire rest of the meal aside from the beer).

This is a good place you can go where you and your Glutenous friends can have a beautiful dinner with wine (or decent GF beer), complete with dessert and not get sick.

My biggest issue is the seating. The tables are so close to each other that I feel like I'm constantly eating with the people on all 4 sides of me. ""Hey random person I don't know, can I try your dragon roll?""  One thing I did learn is not to order appetizers and entrees at the same time because they being everything out at the same time and there's absolutely no room on the tiny 2 person tables for both courses. I did give them 3 stars because I've always been seated fairly quickly, they're friendly, and I've never gotten sick from the food. If you're not chlostrophobic and don't really care about excellent quality, then go here for a large and cheap meal.",0.0
"BOYCOTT LUIGI'S!!!! They put cheese in my son's pizza, even after I told them repeatedly over the phone NOT to, as my son is severely allergic to dairy!!!  The cheese was under all the toppings and hence my 7 year old, who is usually quite aware, wasn't able to see and ate it! It wasn't until I saw the pie that I realized those IDIOTS put cheese in it! It's NOT rocket science !! They claim to be allergy friendly by offering a gluten free crust but how can they employ morons who can't even take the order correctly?? The guy who took my order was in the biggest hurry to get off the phone as apparently he was too busy....well I wasn't asking for a free pizza!! I even told him that I could call when he was free, and that I needed his undivided attention so that he wouldn't mess up the order. And yet, here I am with a sick child because LUIgI'S MESSED UP!!

"Coffee is GREAT. 

Every single drink I've had here has been crafted with so much care and precision. They care so much about the product you're getting and handle each order with the utmost importance.  They're also some of the nicest baristas I've ever encountered. If you want to know more about the coffee, don't be afraid to ask. They're passion for coffee shines through when talking about their product. 

The single origin espresso selection is always very well curated and they pull nice, long shots giving you a full spectrum of flavor, bright and floral, not those short, ashy shots of yester-year. They definitely have things down to a science.

Also, the music here is ON POINT. Original, fun, and diverse, ranging from punk jams to old hip hop through a sick vintage analog system.

One of the city's best!",0.0

"Hard to go wrong with a roof top view, but the rest of the experience is sub bar. Overpriced, sub par drinks - probably one of the worst cocktails I've had in New York. A city where I expect to pay a lot for a drink, but usually the bar tenders care about their craft and the ingredients are quality. The Old Fashioned I had made me sick from the syrupy garbage they mixed in with the bottom-shelf whisky. I'd suggest a beer instead, but I've had better selections at corporate holiday parties.

All the staff at this place are generally rude and un-helpful. They feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you... We approached the host a couple of times to try to secure an area for, what was soon to be a group of 12 people. Because it was just the two of us asking he was like, ""eh, yea, sorry, those are all reserved""... but 15 mins later when additional people showed up, it was a different story! Thanks for fantastically living up to my expectations of NYC bar staff... 

If you need that magically selfie at the top - head up... take the pic... LEAVE, and go to a cool, trendy little bar where the cocktails are better, the atmosphere is cool, and the people aren't total d*cks.

"Yo, hold up a second. Are you guys really telling me you're surprised that a sandwich in NYC costs $7? Are you Siri? Are y'all really gonna cry about that?

"I came here with a brunch deal.. 29 dollars for 2 entree, 2 brunch cocktails, 2 miso soup..

entrees:
- lobster ramen: I can't stop myself from ordering this once I saw ""lobster"" on the menu.. I saw the table next to me had lobster and I was like ""OMG.. such a huge lobster"".. They gave you HUGE lobster.. not the lobster chunk.. like what you will get from a lobster roll.. except that this portion fills me up for a meal.. The soup wasn't like regular miso base.. It tasted really ""creamy"" and ""heavy"".. Seems like the boiled it with lobster.. I like it.. but a little tasteless.. or maybe I was sick, I just can't really taste it?? 
- salmon crepe: My friend love salmon so she ordered the salmon crepe.. It's cute.. but just a small piece of salmon (I think lobster ramen is more worth the order).. and it was ok..

They have interesting cocktails like bloody samurai, yuzu mimosa, FR Sangria.. they don't have sangria that day so we both ordered Yuzu mimosa.. classic cocktail drinks..

service was great and friendly.. it's a cute little spot.. just like ""family"".. they create their own ""recipe""..

"Biggest complaint: they don't care about allergies. I ask for tofu on my bagels because I have a very severe dairy allergy, and this is one of a few places that has tofu spread.  Unfortunately, the people that work there either put cream cheese on my bagels because they're not paying attention, or (as I've been told many times) the person putting the tofu and cream cheese in the containers that go in the cases mixes them up and labels them incorrectly.

This wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't essentially poisoning me every time I get a bagel.  I'd suggest that you watch them make your food or check everything carefully before you leave, because they often confuse orders.

Also, the bagels are often overcooked/completely burned.  I get an attitude from the employees when I ask for new bagels because I literally can't bite into them.  

I also have an issue with the way their system works.  Often, when I place an order, which is always for just a bagel (no wraps, sandwiches, etc.), I'm directed to the registers to pay.  Then the person who took my order and will be preparing my food will also take the order of the next person in line, which is usually more complicated, and my order has to wait to be made.  This has happened several times, and is incredibly frustrating.

These have been recurring issues I've experienced over the last 6 months. I usually go in here at least twice a week, so these are not isolated incidents.  Also, I've contacted the owners through their website, and haven't received any responses.",0.0
"I really hate leaving bad reviews, BUT I really tried to find the positive aspects of this place. Normally, I don't go to non-vegan restaurants unless I am with non-vegan people and I don't want to be a brat by insisting we go elsewhere, I'm not a snob, I'm just tired of getting sick from misunderstandings and cross contamination. I mean, I love diarrhea as much as the next guy, but...I digress.
 
Anyway, as a server, I try to give other servers some slack, but our server was annoyed from the beginning to hear that there were a few vegans at the table. I asked what my options were as it said ""vegan options available"" on the menu. He said there weren't really any options. My boyfriend ordered some plain pasta with tomato sauce which came out with cheese, Ay yi yi. Our server disappeared a whole lot, so another server graciously remedied the pasta and ran our card at the end of the meal after he saw us trying to pay for a long time. We left a good tip because people in the service industry can't tip below a certain percentage without nightsweats, but we handed the other server some cash and thanked him for saving us.

"I really think this place has a great vibe and a beautiful and quiet backyard.

I had heard about this bulletproof butter coffee- sounds delicious! I've just been hearing about it generally speaking. I ordered it, tasted fine... But just after two sips my stomach began to churn, cramp and I felt like vomiting. 

After some research and someone telling me that bulletproof coffee is some type of workout fitness health thing- I was a little concerned. When I returned an almost full glass the man at the counter asked if I didn't like it. I told him the truth that it was good but my stomach had a reaction. He was super apologetic and gave me a bag of cinnamon wine cookies to make up for it and that was really nice of him. BUT he confessed that the coffee has MCT oil in it!! Ahhh!! So just google it. People take this for ""healthy fat"" but it's known to make people queasy who have never had it before. They should provide a warning... I felt sick the rest of the night :( .... But that is my only issue. The yogurt was delicious and the place was really nice --- and the staff, like I said were very apologetic and super nice. Just beware of the MCT oil!!!!",0.0
"For those who've never been here please know there is usually a long wait. So plan ahead and accordingly - when i say accordingly, please know they don't take reservations over the phone - you have to be there in person. The lines are long but luckily there is a ""Leave your Cell# and we'll call you back"" option. That is if you don't die from starvation first. 

lets say you stay fully committed and toughed through the trails of fire and ice outside the restaurant because it was just too crowded in the front right next to the expensive bar. They will lead your now starving scrawny body in tattered rags into the dining room area. Leave your walking stick and vulture / hyena / wolf or whatever scavenger is dragging on you at the door.

you will be greeted with the loudest of garbled yelling from a different land - ""IIRASHAIMASE!!!"" which is exotic-nese for WELCOME!! this will totally make you feel like Marco Polo traversing to india for spices and they invite you in with open arms. They sit you down in a dim lit room with picnic tables to the left or smaller loungey tables around the corner.

Your waiter will give you water to start, which at this point you will be too shaky from starvation to care much for it and look at the menu. They have nice Appetizers to share like pork belly buns, edamame, chicken wings or even carpaccio. it's a nice start but you demand the main reason why you came in here the first place - The Ramen.

Their Ramen is more of the Hakata style in Japan. usually Pork based. The Hakata Classic or the Akamaru is the way to go as a first time try. The difference between the 2 is that the Akamaru has a more Miso-Umami note on top of the classic. The noodle is thin and the broth is thick which makes it great for slurping. If you have a cold, the Karaka Men is a spicier version of the Akamaru and it's great to clear up your sinus' and perfect as a comfort food when you're sick. 

They also had a seafood special called the Chesapeake Tonkotsu. Sounds amazing if your a seafood fan. Not so much seafood as the typical ChanPon but more of a pork broth with seafood elements.. in all honesty it just tasted like Tonkotsu with Old Bay spice. I didn't find it that impressive. The noodle was also a bit thicker and wavy compared to the Akamaru too.

when done and ready to leave, they will all yell garbles at you ARIGATO GOZAIMASU!!! which means thank you. if you're brave enough and want to show your gratitude you yell back the same thing at them!! and now you leave this dark exotic land with a new found experience and are ready to tell your friends of your epic tale. Ride on Marco Polo! Ride on!!

All in all the food was great! the reason I gave 3 stars is because of the long wait time and the above average price for a bowl of ramen.

-Go to a bar near by while you wait. it's St Marks. Bars are a dime a dozen.

It has all this potential but then just kind of drops the ball, which is too bad in Brooklyn, where any coffee shop worth its salt is full all the time. Nope, this place is kind of empty cos they just don't care. Barista is super nice, but the set-up is dark and awkward, music isn't great.

I didn't know avocado could be, like, fermented. Gave up after two bites, and told the barista who looked very sympathetic but didn't offer to do anything.

"Bubby's brunch is where its at!

I have been craving pancakes for weeks and after a bought of food poisoning my stomach was poised for a down home, good 'ol fashion big breakfast!

Pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Honestly, what more can you ask for. The food comes out astonishingly fast. Be warned, these pancakes are monsters. The hub and I can usually down any plate, but we were honestly stuffed with just 1 of the 2 ginormous pancakes. These guys are heavy yet light at the same time. I dunno how they managed that, but top them with some butter and maple syrup and these are a meal in itself. I came here for the pancakes and I was not disappointed. They hit the spot and even the pancake I had that I took home, was still the same consistently as when it came out piping hot.

"I had dinner at Aquagrill with a good friend this past Tuesday night.  It was my second time at the restaurant.  My first time was on a Saturday night with 3 friends, and the place was too packed and loud for my taste.  It is a popular restaurant, and deserves to be, but a low-key Tuesday night experience was more to my liking.

First, the service was second to none.  Alex, the manager, brought us two glasses of champagne and a pumpkin pie desert on the house.  She was very friendly, professional and genuinely wanted us to have a great experience.  What surprised me was that she didn't seem pressed for time.  We chatted with her for quite a while and enjoyed the conversation.  She came by our table just enough to check up on how we were doing, but not too much that we felt interrupted.  One thing I find annoying in restaurants is when a staff member asks you, right after you've taken a bite of food, ""how's everything?"" ... and you feel rushed to chew and swallow and answer them.  Alex came by several times and chatted with us, but never were we in that awkward situation. There was a natural and easy flow to the service all night.  

Our waiter, who looked like a young Charlie Sheen -- and we told him that and had a laugh about it (he'd been told this many times before) -- was really cool too.  Easy going, professional and just a good guy.  The best service is when it's natural, and that's what Alex and Charlie Sheen were all night.  Bad service is when they're trying too hard and it becomes annoying, or when they pay so little attention to you that you end up spending a lot of time looking for them.  

After discussing the menu with Alex, my friend and I both decided on the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass.  This is just an incredible dish!  The balance of flavors and textures and colors is ... in a word ... perfection.  We were both blown away, and I could see myself coming back over and over and ordering this dish until I got sick of it.  Then I'd explore the rest of the menu.  

I had mine with a side of Soft Truffle Polenta, which was amazing as well.  Alex suggested this side to me.  I had overlooked it because ""polenta"" doesn't exactly sound exciting.  But she said the truffle in it makes it great, and she was right.  It was a unique and delicious side dish that went perfectly with the Sea Bass.

My friend is Russian, so we ordered two shots of vodka with dinner.  They generously brought us double shots.  Russians do shots in between each course to boost up the appetite, and it really works.  I was sold on vodka shots with dinner, and was glad we didn't bother with wine or beer.  

For desert, we ordered a chocolate cake with walnuts and vanilla ice cream on top that was divine.  Divine!  Like I said, Alex brought us a free pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top.  It was also really good, and a nice Thanksgiving-time desert.

Overall, Aquagrill did a superb job on food and service, and I enjoyed sitting in the enclosed patio looking out at Sixth Avenue.  Just a great dinner experience!  

I'd highly recommend the more chill Tuesday night Aquagrill experience.  I'd say the restaurant was 80% full.  Perfect, in my mind.

I feel like I found a hidden secret in NYC:  Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Soft Truffle Polenta and the Chocolate Walnut Cake at Aquagrill on a Tuesday night.  Oh, yeah, and with vodka shots (Russian style). 

Shhhh!   Keep it to yourself, or Tuesdays will soon turn into Saturdays.  ;)",0.0
"I have been going to all of the Gari locations for years, and I""ve never experienced worse service. They have a set item on their menu that's a chef's special, where it's basically a plate of 8 of the most popular, dressed-up pieces. My friend is allergic to tofu, and asked if she could have a different tuna, or just PLAIN tuna instead of the tuna with tofu piece that they *usually* give you. Mind you, they don't tell you what the exact pieces will be - it says chef's selection. The waitress comes over and tells her that since it's a ""special price"" - hmm,  no where on the menu does it say it's a special, we aren't talking abt a lunch special or anything (this was dinner, and we ordered off the regular menu), that they can't do any substitutions. My friend pleaded that instead of the special sauce, she will have it plain, but if they give her the tofu sauce, she will end up in an ambulance since she's allergic to soy. Never, EVER, has this been a problem, especially at any of the other Sushi of Gari restaurants, or any established sushi restaurant in NYC... you'd think they would want to avoid someone going into anaphylactic  shock. The waitress continued to tell her she would have to get omakase ($100+ rather than the $52 set) so she could specify what she didn't want, but with this item, she would have to take the piece and just not eat it. 

We asked to see a manager, who was even more rude and condescending, but FINALLY said they would accommodate us, but not with another ""Gari"" piece, with a plain piece of tuna. I didn't realize the tofu sauce, or searing it like the other tuna piece, or even the tuna tartar piece (chopped tuna) cost that much more that they would go through such great lengths to make someone feel so uncomfortable. We also ordered two additional pieces that weren't on the set menu, because we weren't allowed to request uni or oyster... clearly we weren't just cheaping out, we just wanted what we wanted. 

I NEVER rant on yelp... I am in the restaurant business, write a food blog, and I have been coming to Sushi of Gari for over 12 years. I will NEVER go back to this location. Thank goodness they have others, because I've only heard this one is going downhill (my sister got food poisoning last time she came), and as much as I wanted to remain a loyal fan to the brand, if they don't change their standards of hospitality, it will never get better.

"The food is all right. I order a lot of omelets from here since they have a good selection. I'm a little frustrated with Coral though; I always request no home fries or French fries with my omelets. The frying oil upsets my stomach and when they package it all together even eating just the omelet will make me sick. However they NEVER follow my instructions to not include the home fries!  I'm happy to pay the same price, I don't know why they can't just not include all the fried stuff. It's pretty frustrating, especially when there are so few dining options in this area.

"One of the best restaurants in Flushing. Don't get me wrong, the food is worthy of 5 stars, but my concerns lower it down to a 4. I, who cares much about food safety, have never found the correct time to come to Joe's Shanghai since they can never keep clean. They either have a C, B, or Grade Pending. They haven't had an A in the past year, or so. I eliminated this irksome feeling and just went in, while they had a B. I can't get food poisoning from one of the most highly rated restaurants in Flushing. We walked in at around 5:00, thinking that it would be very crowded. There was a very short wait when we walked in and we got a table in the back. The waiter was trying to be helpful by setting our table, but never allowed me to go into my seat. It must have been like 2 minutes and the guy is doing his procedures, and I can't get by him. Okay... Then, once we sat down, the first thing the waiter said was ""Soup dumplings?"" No hello or anything. Just a way to get money, but not accommodating the guests. Anyway, you can't pass up this kind of offer. 8 soup dumplings came right away, the pork kind. Amazing. So much broth and a good portion of meat. The skin was thin, not flaky and sticky. The meat was tender, and the soup had a strong kick to it. We had ordered some main dishes, but the waiter was so confused by what we were getting. We had ordered two noodle soups and he had almost left before we told him ""two soups!"" Well, he tried his best. I have already established that most Chinese restaurant waiters are not bilingual. Anyway, food came out quickly, and it was very hot. I caught of glimpse of the restaurant and for a Sunday night, I was shocked by the amount of open tables. Oh well, they do make a good business though. Prices are very reasonable. The shrimp noodle soup was fantastic, with great, thin noodles, and an abundance of shrimp and vegetables. The seafood noodle soup had squid, scallops, shrimp, crab meat, and some unidentified fish that was sliced, along with fresh noodles and lots of vegetables. Maybe a few mushrooms too. Great flavor, but there was close to no broth, but I was okay with that, since there were so many other additives. The scallion pancakes weren't too oily, and had a great texture. Good with soy sauce. The shredded orange beef was cooked well and had a great sauce. Fresh broccoli on the side. A cheap diner with great atmosphere.

"I've never been to Tony Roma's before. I was asked by a business associate to meet there for lunch to talk over some things. 

The table wasn't cleaned properly and when I unrolled my silverware from the napkin, crumbs fell out. Our server acknowledged us rather quickly, but then disappeared for quite a while before coming back to take our drink order. He also questioned me when I ordered a wedge salad for my appetizer. Um, I order what I want, how I want and you don't have the right to question me about it. 

Then, the smell. We were sat in the back, which was fine, but there was a DISGUSTING odor coming from the bathroom that was quite offending. Thankfully, we weren't right next to the bathroom, but it was horrid nonetheless. And it wasn't my imagination because one of the employees went by with that bucket from school that they used when someone got sick  outside of the bathroom. They shouldn't have even sat us in that section until it was cleaned and aired out thoroughly. The restaurant wasn't even busy. 

The food was ok. The salad was doable, the fried calamari edible. I say this having been FAMISHED at the time, so take that as you will. The house pinot grigio drinkable. Nothing outstanding. Nothing that would make me choose Tony Roma's if it's my choice of where we are dining. In fact, we could have had better food at the Shake Shack on the other side of the Barclays Center for less money. That's not something I think I should be able to say. If you're able to get a space like this, you should be hitting it out of the park all day, every day. Not resting on your location to get you through.

"My favorite food is Fish Tacos! And being from Texas, my taste buds lean towards great Mexican food.

I ordered delivery last night, totaling $25 (for just lil ol' me) which included:

- Shrimp Soup 
It was watery, the shrimp was extremely over cooked and unfortunately had a thick dark hair in it which immediately turned me off and made me fearful to consume anything else in my order.

- Baja Street Corn
They just completely go over board with the thick layer of powder which takes away from the simplicity of roasted corn.

- Classic Cali
I was absolutely DISGUSTED!!!!! There was a horrid smell coming from the cod fish, I knew immediately that  the fish had gone bad and I trusted my instincts not to make myself sick with food poisoning.  

- Cabo
I took one bite and regretted it. It was way below par, cold and not seasoned. Terrible! 

I do not understand how this place is still in business. I hope that the next time the city comes in to check the cleanliness of this place that they shut it down.

"The single star is solely for the salads in the Deli Case at this particular location.  They are shockingly bad.  There.  I said it.  My recent visit was the final straw:  I brought home a container of potato salad, which based on previous experiences, was one of the safer bets taste-wise, aside from the occasional undercooked potato. I did not even bother to ask for a taste beforehand, which I often do--because I figured it would be decent.  Alas, ""decent"" would be one of the last words I'd use to ultimately describe this potato salad.  I took one bite and spit it out.  It had such a strange, off-putting flavor, I was afraid I was going to wind up with food poisoning.  I was actually going to return it to let customer service know, but too much time elapsed.  But yeah, I don't want anyone else to experience such a scary, scary excuse for potato salad.

This was, by far, the worst of WF's culinary crimes against deli salads.  But there have been other minor offenses.  Like adding so much raw garlic to a kale salad  so as to repel every vampire in Mystic Falls (aka where Vampire Diaries takes place).  (And I love garlic!)  Or how about drowning a shredded collard green salad with too much dressing?  Too much bland dressing.  In fact, a little salt and pepper would go along way here.  Extreme blandness, in fact, has probably been the biggest offense for me, spoiled potato salad, excepted, of course.  

I get the sense that the people making these salads either have little to no real culinary experience, or they just don't care.  Or maybe WF mandates that certain *bland* recipes be used.  Though that does not explain the total lack of quality control regarding my potato salad experience.  And WF culivates an image that includes concern for quality.

"Since they opened they have been overcharging Fort Greene residents any way they can with little concern for their customers wellbeing. One night my dog was sick and the vet said I needed Pepcid-AC. An eight pill pack was over $8 which is about a 400% markup.  Another time they sold my neighbor recalled Children's Tylenol that had just been in the news. The neighbor even asked beforehand if the Children's Tylenol was part of the recall. When she got home she went online and sure enough they should have been removed from the shelves. She brought them back for a refund and they showed no interest in doing the right thing. A day later they were still selling the recalled meds. Their prices on milk and ice cream are the highest in the area (go to Ralph's to compare). The other day I bought an overpriced piece of watermelon. There was no ""prepared on"" or ""sell by"" date on the printed Fresh Garden price sticker. When I got home and unwrapped the watermelon it was  spoiled; slimy, rancid and inedible. It tasted pickled. I was so mad I took the pieces and the undated price sticker back and asked to speak to the manager. Big surprise: ""Manager is not here."" I explained the situation to the checkout clerk who after a few words back and forth told me to take a new piece of watermelon in exchange. I said: ""None of the fresh produce has a ""sell by"" date, so how do I know this is edible?"" ""It was just cut and wrapped today"" was the response. ""Then why doesn't it have a date on the label?!!"" Isn't this illegal? They are ripping people off and risking their health with spoiled produce and expired, recalled meds. If I did not live a few blocks away I would have been out $5 for the spoiled watermelon. They also charge a fee to use a credit card, which IS totally illegal. They do whatever they can to scam a few cents off you however they can. Once they charged me sales tax on unprepared foods and then claimed it was a mistake. I will never even step foot in that greedy establishment again if I can help it.",0.0
My husband and I decided to order take out from here on one cold rainy day. We were both sick with a sore throat and cough. Delivery was quick. Barely 20 mins. We got the red curry which was amazing and was so soothing for a sore throat. The spicy chicken wings are a great appetizer very flavorful and have a smokey BBQ taste. We also got the bo luc lac teriyaki steak cubes - so good. I can't wait to try more items.,0.0
"This place is awful . The bar service is hands down the slowest service in the area . Twelve minutes for a glass of wine! When I asked what was taking so long, I was told they had to go downstairs and get another bottle because they were out. Common sense would tell me that should be done before a lunch or dinner rush, so the guest is not stuck waiting around For their wine while their appetizers are dropped off at the table. 
It appears like the management has no idea how to stock a bar or give directions to staff . The day manager is incredibly unprofessional, she looked like she just rolled out of bed,wiped last nights makeup off her face and threw her greasy hair in a messy ponytail.
After my horrible experience I started researching various review websites for this place.  It turns out they recently (April 2015) FAILED the NYC Health inspection, being below sanitary guidelines.  There are always fruit flies around the bar area , I can't even imagine what the kitchen is like!?
I ordered a salad and there was a hair in my food. GROSS! So instead , I asked for a glass of water and the glass was so filthy I could not even drink from it! When I sent it back the waitress tried to sell me VOSS bottled water ?!?! Not sure what buying water would have accomplished? I'm sure it would have still gone in the same filthy glass as the tap water served . 
I give this place 2 stars anyway however. The first for location. It's very convenient from Times Square, Broadway, Port Authority, and the subway system. The second ;meh; the decorator created a great atmosphere with such a small space . However , other than the location and the chic design of the space I would never eat or drink here again for the fear of getting food poisoning from the dirty kitchen or ingesting bacteria from the filthy water/ bar glasses. 
Tourists and locals take caution. Always check the letter grade in the restaurant window before making a selection as to where to dine in NYC. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT has implicated the letter grade system for good reason. It could mean the difference between eating food that has not been stored at the correct temp., or not! Drinking from a bar glass that is not being kept behind a bar that uses the correct amount of disinfectant when cleaning, or not! This can be all the difference between food poisoning and an enjoyable time in NYC.",0.0
"For the two and a half years I've been living in Astoria, I've always lamented the fact that there wasn't a good Chinese place in the neighborhood.  Plenty of options for sushi, Thai, Mexican, Greek, etc., but nowhere to order tasty Chinese food from.  I'd walked by plenty of the hole-in-the-wall Chinese places on my way home from the train, but every single one looks like a haven for food poisoning.  And what's with the trend of Chinese food places featuring faded picture menus that look like they haven't been updated since roughly 1978?

Imagine my surprise, when on a late-night walk with my dog the other night I look through the window of Xing's Chef and notice the non-sketchy menu above the counter.  I immediately got on my phone to check out the place's ratings, and found out that Yelp-ers had given it mostly 4 and 5 star reviews!  I new I had to try it out for lunch the next day.

When I went in to order take-out for lunch, a staff member was in the midst of sweeping what already looked to be a very clean floor.  He and the other staff members were very friendly (even though they were a bit difficult to understand).  I ordered when I walked in, and my food was ready to go in 5-10 minutes, which was awesome.  The lunch special was around $6.75 for a dish and a drink, which I thought was a pretty good deal.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the food portion was generous - I wasn't able to finish my Kung Pao Chicken and will happily have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I've yet to eat my meal at the restaurant, so I cannot vouch for that experience (another reviewer mentioned not getting water with the meal).  But as far as take-out is concerned, this place was really solid and I'm thrilled to discover that there actually IS a decent Chinese place close by.",0.0
"This place is the WORST! Seems like a good idea on the surface, but paying $15 for a po' boy is like some kind of sick joke!! I know there's people with money in the area now, but this is unbelievable. To add insult to injury the sandwich barely had anything on it. I didn't count, but there had to have been like 5 x-small shrimp in that thing. Not sure what the deal is, but I guess rent for food trucks in Bushwick is high these days? Is skimping on ingredients going to help?

Do yourself a favor and go to a bodega, order a lettuce and tomato sandwich on a hero, then go to Long John Silvers, order fried shrimp, put it all together and save yourself $10. This place is not worth the time or money whatsoever. Plus the girl taking orders was nothing but standoffish and rude. Girl's got a problem! Maybe she knows this spot is doomed! Unless there's a bunch of rich kids in the hood who have been duped into thinking this is something worthwhile, can't see this place being open for more than a month from now. If not, Bushwick has truly changed for the worse. Funny to see so many positive reviews. The owner of this spot must have a lot of friends, or else people are just completely clueless??",0.0
"I went with a group of six on Valentine's Day for dinner, and the service and food were so abysmal and horrid that I decided to sign up for Yelp and post my first restaurant review. 

To start off, I made a reservation for Valentine's night a few days prior for four people with no issues. Around Sat. afternoon, another couple wanted to join our party of four, so I quickly called the Yam, same number I used prior in the week, and asked if they could seat six instead of four for the same time. ""Sure!"" they said. ""Sweet!"" I said. However, upon arriving a few hours later, everybody at the front (there was just a confused orgy of employees bobbing around with no real sense of place) had suffered  the same unfortunate head injury, as they had no record indicating that I had changed the reservation from four to six. After some initial confusion, they found some room for my party, and everything was cool, for about ten minutes.

After everybody from my party was seated, one of our waiters (Larry) came by and asked if we wanted some drinks. He wasn't super helpful, and didn't really give any solid suggestions for the few Filipino beers they had, nor did he have any real opinions on other drinks. Which is fine--maybe he doesn't drink, or maybe he just doesn't like having strong opinions. Anyways, we pick some drinks, and then Waiter is off to the back of the joint. About ten minutes later, another waiter (Moe) comes and asks us if we want any drinks, as we were still sitting at a table with nothing on it. We tell him we already ordered and thank him. About five minutes after Waiter-Prime, yet another waiter (Curly) comes and asks us if we want drinks. At this point, we thought it was some kind of joke, and they just wanted to provide us with some light entertainment before we ever got our drinks. But man, if that was a joke, then they definitely believe in recycling, 'cause they would repeat that same stinker for every course, and a few times just for the hell of it. So we had three waiters, and no booze, and no food for almost a half hour.

After the booze finally hit, we just decided to order a bunch of items from the fixed menu (all at outrageous prices) and get on with it. We placed our order with Waiter, then told Moe and Curly that everything was kosher. Now, the place is not that big to begin with, and the seats were filled for the most part, and it was Valentine's Day, so nobody in my party was being unreasonable or rude with most of these shenanigans for most of the time. We got a few appetizers, and they were small, barely shareable portions (one of the waiters, maybe Moe, told us ""yeah, you can definitely share these appetizers"" and I hope he's sitting at home ""sharing"" a single slice of pizza with somebody, trying to stretch the meaning of sharing, as they contemplate all the wrong decisions they made in life to end up at his place on this night. ) Whatever, we ate them, they tasted like cabbage, and then we moved onto the the entrees, which were a few orders of duck and adobo short ribs for the table.

Now, in between the appetizers and Entrees is a huge gulf of time where nothing happens except for sadness and ""hey, do you guys want more water or drinks??"" There's like a 40 minute block of time where we contemplate scavenging for food from others' plates, hoping they ordered anything but cabbage. But then Larry brings out the meat, and we relax, and we get excited, and we look at this sad small plain duck that's in front of us, and it's pink and rubber-raw. I quickly take a bite and realize ""No, yeah, this tastes exactly the way it looks--uncooked"". We flag down one of the knuckleheads, probably Moe, and just show him the issue. He brings the ducks back, apologizes, and then disappears. now we're all stuck with one small order of short ribs between six people, and this awful paella that we ordered--it had three crawfish, which we divvied up like survivors of a downed airplane. Eventually somebody brings our duck back out, and it's a completely different dish. It has a sauce on it, is cooked right, and has some tomato-or-something atop it. It was good, and completely, miraculously different than the abomination that was presented prior, and it was gone in 3 bites. 

As we waited for our waiter trio to clear the table, we all contemplated running to the Indian place next door and getting a real meal with some real service. Everybody was still hungry, everybody was cranky, and we just wanted the three waiters to all fall down the same basement door that somebody accidentally left open because ""oops!"".  We got the bill, saw that it was over $300 dollars, took note that everybody was still super hungry, and then just paid like idiots. 

Nobody should have to pay for that atrocious experience, and the restaurant should feel embarrassed to present such a disorganized mess of a joint. Thanks for ruining six peoples' nights, Purple Yam! At least nobody got food poisoning, I guess.",0.0

Fool me once shame on you fool me twice SHAME ON ME...never again, least I never got food poisoning from here....jeez...",0.0
"I wish I could tell you whether or not their food tastes any good, but I can't. What I can tell you is that the people working there have no clue what they're serving up and it's likely a bunch of unhealthy shite that no one should be consuming on the regular (probably at all). 

As soon as I walked in I swear I could smell the diarrhea brewing in the patrons sitting on those uncomfortable looking swings while the grease soaked into their handlebar mustaches and flannel shirts. If you've ever walked by and wondered why no one was swinging on those swings I can say with some confidence that it's likely because they'd hurl. It's a mystery to me that they'd even consider putting swings in a place serving grease, fat, and creamy sauces in flour wraps exclusively. *gurgle*

So, despite the nasty, greasy smell, I decided I still might give the place a go because I was starving and there were some things on the menu that made me feel like I might be able to avoid a morning of butt-snuggling my toilet. There was only one thing I needed to know: Are all of their wraps made with wheat? Now, before you start/continue to judge, I'm not one of these diet fad people who claims to have an allergy that doesn't exist-- I just really prefer to avoid wheat because I don't like it. The girls behind the counter (one of whom was actually preparing the wraps) told me that only one of their wraps has wheat -- the whole wheat wrap. This was unexpected and exciting news for me and I proceeded to ask what they use in their other wraps. The answer: bleached flour. FLOUR. Made from wheat. And then bleached.  

You might think this isn't such a big deal, but based on my experience, you tell me if you got the right answer when you asked about that mystery meat, or the contents of that fatty sauce, or whether or not that one wrap that sounds vegetarian is actually vegetarian. I'm willing to bet that your guess is as good as theirs... except that they won't tell you they're guessing. 

I decided to walk out and avoid any further misinformation, but maybe some people enjoy intimate time with their toilets more than I do.",0.0
"I had an interesting experiencing the first time I came here. Our server was very nice and we made some conversation with her. I ordered a burger with a gluten-free bun. About half-way through eating it, she came over and said she believed it wasn't gluten-free. Whoops. She immediately took it away and had it remade (she didn't bring us our food, another server did). Yeah, I still got sick, but I appreciated that my server picked up on it and corrected it as soon as she could. She was extremely apologetic and gave us free drinks. Accidents happen, and she went out of her way to make up for it.

Husband and I ordered through Seamless. My husband's sushi rolls had completely fallen apart between the restaurant and our apartment. He called to complain and the woman said ""sorry"" and hung up on him. Meanwhile, I'd started eating my food and was noticing things tasted weird--my vegetable rolls had a musky smell to them. Finally, I ate a piece of the ginger and discovered it was completely rancid and smelled like an old man's armpit. Finally, I decided to try to the miso soup, thinking no one on Earth can mess that up, right? Wrong. Same musky smell, like the miso paste had been dug out of the ground months before and left to sit unrefrigerated. We called the restaurant to demand a refund and they told us we had to do it through Seamless because ""Seamless holds the money""--bullshit. A representative from Seamless called the restaurant for us and they'd refunded the money within minutes.

Do not eat from this place. I'm sitting here patiently awaiting the food poisoning that is sure to assail me any minute now.",0.0
"Visited because my wife was feeling nostalgic -- thought we could score a decent take-out soup. Snapped a couple' shots to text to our daughter to see what she wanted. Counterman got belligerent; spoke in an accent so thick, he was unintelligible. After three tries we understood he was intending to charge us to take pictures. The food on display, incidentally, didn't look like much--pretty tired. So here is the EAT marketing proposition: charge truly psychotic prices ($48 per pound for cooked lamb, $8 for a slice of quiche), maintain a surly,  sneering attitude, and be truly unembarrassed by any of this. If you're self-esteem is so low, and you are only happy if you're being ripped off and treated poorly, this is your place. Unless you have a screw loose, you will move on. Since the""screw-loose"" population is in a distinct minority, the traffic here -- and as a result, the turnover in prepared foods -- is so low, there is probably a higher than average likelihood of getting food poisoning.  One star because Yelp does not allow zero.",0.0

"We arrived at Indian Curry Express and first noticed the pending grade sign on the front window from the NYCDOHMH ( We later contacted and learned from the Department of New York City of Health and Hygiene that this restaurant had seven food violations between April 23, 2015 and May 19th, 2015. Three of the violations state:

"" 1.) Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.
 
   2.) Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.).

   3.) Food not protected from potential source of contamination during storage, preparation, transportation, display or service.""  

Unknowingly we placed the order.  The female at the register took a credit card for payment, then called someone on her personal cell phone to read out the credit card number and security code. As we stood and waited for our receipt we saw into the open kitchen and I noticed a dark grey mouse peek out from under the stove.  I told my boyfriend, wondering if I was mistaken,  he looked over the counter and saw it (or its colleague) dash out. He told the lady and the chef that we just noticed a mouse in the kitchen, she dismissed the comment while still on the phone and superficially said that there was ""no mice"", the chef continued to work away without surprise...

She returned the credit card and brought out the meal in a brown paper bag to take out.  We asked for our receipt and she said that she will text it to us - after giving our cell phone number we took the food and left.

With a lot of hesitation and regret I opened the bag and without surprise the food was deplorable. We returned to the empty restaurant.   
Hearing about our dissatisfaction with the food the same woman who took out payment told her chef to ""finish"" our meal. I asked her why the ingredients advertised on the menu were not in the meal and why we were not told that the kitchen did not have the ingredients on hand before we paid. She shook her head and said that she will give a partial refund. 

We agreed. 

Forty five minutes later and three more calls to the shadowy third party making requests to text the receipt with no success. We asked who she shared the credit card information with. She explained nonchalantly that a third party does the transaction on Paypal.  This seems to be a legitimate business practice at this establishment. 

Then a young male  dashed out from the kitchen, not introducing himself, and demanding to know what the problem was with our order. 

 I explained again that the food on the menu was not what I had received.  He retorted swiftly that if I had tried the food, then I had to pay for it! I replied that I had no issue with payment - but I wanted to receive what I paid for and I wanted a receipt. He told me that ""the menu states that ingredients are subject to change without notice"" and he had ""no obligation to print it out each time that the ingredients changed"".  [Note: No such statement appears on the take out menu].  

The woman finally pulled out her personal cell phone and showed a screen-shot of the transaction.  She brought out a brown bag with my returned food that had been refined in the kitchen after my complaint. We left with no receipt and the inedible food.

As we walked out my boyfriend recapped his rule: empty restaurant = bad omen.  He took the brown bag that we were handed and put in the waste receptacle as we walked back, determining that food poisoning would not be on our itinerary during our visit to New York.

Tonight I learned from Indian Curry Express that if I see mice busily scooting while the chef is fixing the meal - expect some ingredient not to make it to the final ""fine Indian cuisine"" masterpiece.

Having read reviews on this site about Indian Curry Express over charging and credit card fraud I had to close off the credit card used that evening.

The food...

Look, the food wasn't terrible. Nobody got food poisoning. Nothing was inedible, but for an $110 per person meal, I expected better. 
I tasted the following:

Tuna Tartare - The worst of the bunch. The sauce was oily and flavorless. It tasted like it was drenched in olive oil. I can't swear that it was olive oil because the flavor was somewhat masked by soy and other sauces, but it was actually a bit difficult to eat.

Brussels Sprouts and Bacon - All the bacon was at the bottom of the dish and the whole plate seemed a bit under done. Given the current popularity of these little sprouts, I'd think a place like this would have higher standards.

Mac & Cheese - This was actually quite good... quite, quite good. Had I ordered a large plate of Mac & Cheese, this would be a five-star review.

30-day Dry Aged NY Strip - It wasn't a terrible piece of meat, but it wasn't transcendent, it wasn't the best I've ever had... It was a little tough, it was cooked a little more than requested - more medium than rare - and the juiciness just wasn't what I was expecting.

My first time here. I don't live in NY, I went with my brother and friends who happen to live around the corner. He had a groupon for the place, which seems to be a pretty popular option for Beso. Great groupon btw... 8 tapas!!! We ate like kings and queens! 4 of us in all, enjoyed the sangria! (white) Though we ordered more tapas and another pitcher of the good stuff. 

The food, I thought was insanely good! I usually am not a fan of tapas in general, because I am not the type of girl that likes to share food. LOL But the arepas (Is that how you spell it?) All I know is they were AWESOME!!! Very filling and the flavors were meshed well. 

Service was cool. This place is small, so I always expect that in a small space, a waitress could tell when we needed assistance. We sometimes wouldn't see our waitress for a while... There was a birthday party going on the same night though, so I'm sure they kept her busy. I cant recall the servers name, but I think she did a great job explaining the menu. She was pleasant and even cracked a few jokes with us. 

I would come again. Hopefully for Fri night Karaoke.

***Note to those who read the previous reviews......
-Now, honestly... had I read the reviews prior to going, we wouldn't have gone. At least I know I wouldn't have. (The people in my group were hellbent on using those groupons, understandably so.) In fact, I usually check yelp anytime I go to a new place, so it really must have been meant for me to come here and check them out. I was too tired and hungry to check my app this time around. 
-Give them the benefit of the doubt. The food is really good!
-Looks as if the owner is trying to change the reputation of the place. I can respect that, especially since this is a cute little spot.
-There is a B rating on the door. I know, I know.... but yeah... also was a turnoff for me. I live in MD where our restaurants don't have ratings posted, so when I see anything lower than a A, I panic. Yet, here I am Wednesday after going to this place on Sat with no food poison. lol So.... it's fine guys.",0.0
"I didn't think it was the best burger place I've been to but the burger was pretty good. I ordered the supreme with a side of sweet potato fries. It looked very nice non eaten but it was so oily and big, It took awhile eating it. The sweet potato fries were a disappointment. I did not like them at all. Worst of all, they didn't give me a side, they gave me the regular size and pricing which was like double the side price. But the side portion is really big that none of my friends even finished their sides and they are guys. The fries were so dry and didn't taste like sweet potato at all, I just gave up on eating them. They gave us different sauces which was nice. I hesitated to try this place because my friend got food poisoning when she came. But I turned out fine!

"I attend Dada, frequently .... Lately i have noticed changes, i have always been very satisfied with the food(esp my breakfast i choose to go here because the young Spanish gentlemen man makes amazing omelettes,always warm to perfection and delicious not greasy at all)  May i say on Monday morning i was looking forward to having my delicious crepes and breakfast but instead i got  a DRY GREASY , BURNED crepe!!! , Am familiar with the faces in Cafe Dada most of the staff greats me with a great welcome. ... This isn't the first time i get a dish that looks like the cook took the food and just threw it on the plate and put it in the microwave and served it this way; About a few weeks ago by boys played there a jazz band , and i ordered a turkey meatloaf, and once again the same chef made my food , gave me turkey meatloaf with a uncooked egg and cold meatloaf , the women whom i think is one of the managers apologized to me, and knew how to handle the situation..i was very happy she handled it very professional on her part.. But after this second incident i won't be attending there, neither will my family , Am not risking my health or another human health all because the cook clearly doesn't know, anything about cooking. Such a shame a great Cafe and great employees  but horrible cooking skills from that cook . I really  hope this situation is fixed , because anyone can really be sick from under cooked food, Good luck to this Cafe Dada.",0.0

"I came here on a Sunday morning with the boyfriend and his family for dim sum.

It was a little taken a back by the fact that a hot pot and barbecue place would serve dim sum. However with their new fancy advertising up front screaming we now serve dim sum, it was inevitable that Asian families will try it out.

We walked in and the space was very modern, it felt like a more Asian version of 99 Favor Taste. I dunno if good looks=good food. Theres basically only 2 or 3 carts in the entire restaurant that circulate around very slowly. We picked up a bunch of items including dim sum classics like shirmp rice roll and chicken feet. The quality of the food was very bad, almost leftover. The eggplant shrimp tasted expired, and everything did not taste fresh. Worse of all, the cilantro rice roll we had to order fresh was made with expired flour--it was sour. I am surprised we did not get food poisoning. 

Service was the only thing that was OK. But you know its not a real dim sum restaurant when you only have 3 carts going around. I hope we never go back.",0.0
"I just got home and showered and can't contain myself. This is the best sandwich that I have ever split with one of my best friends in my LIFE! AHHHHHHHHHHH! I WANT TO LIVE IN BROOKLYN SUB. No joke. The only things you need to know is that they can put almost anything you want on to a sandwich for a ridiculously cheap amount of money and that they turn off their grills by 6pm. I almost don't even know what the hell we got because Ingrid hasn't really eaten in like 2-3 days from stress. BUT Zaneta I think got a sub sandwich with sesame seed bun with jerk turkey or smoked jerk turkey of some sorts with jack cheese, tomato, lettuce, tiny bit of mayo, vinegar & oil, and jalapenos. Lots of freaking jalapenos. And I got another beer and plopped down and poured that dog fish head into a styrofoam cup. I say that I can live here because they have everything you could ever want and bare with me I have a photogenic memory: toilet paper, towels, advil, sanitary pads, cat/dog food, fresh fruit!, mixers, amy's soup, oreos, amy's organic bunny & the parmesan mac & cheese, gold fish crackers, ramen noodles, kraft dinner, cereals, organic cookies, chips ahoy, pepperidge farm, those hazelnut pieruette twirl cookies you dip in coffee that are amazing, a million kinds of chips/nuts: including party mix with both sun chips, dorritos & cheetos. You've got to be kidding me. I can seriously keep going. I have issues. But I also want to live in this store. It's the best thing since Jesus. Also, WAY fresher than Subway and doesn't make me want to vomit after ingesting it. Two thumbs up.

"It's with pain in my heart I can't give this more then 3 stars. Jennifer's Way is clearly not this celiacs way :( I read Jennifers book in a mere matter of days and it hit home to me in a big way. Ever since I was a kid I've been struggling with my dietary tract - always belly pains, a seriously swollen belly, cramps, no stool for days, diarrhea for days  - plain agony. And somehow it's always been blamed on who I am, not on what I have or what I eat. ""She's an emotional child, sensitive, easily stressed"" etc. etc. So reading Jennifers book I realized: it's not me who causes my pains, it's what I have and what I eat. This was one of the most emotional experiences in my life, and I haven't been (feeling) the same since. I am currently undergoing the tests, have been on an elimination diet and I am almost pain free! But here's my deal: I am extremely intolerant to nuts and seeds (in particular quinoa) and there was not a single product in the shop I could buy, because they all have almond flour, quinoa flour and some kind of seed (poppy, sesame) or nut. So, after being ecstatic for weeks, after walking for an hour from one end of the city to the other, after driving my husband crazy with my anticipation - I had to leave the shop empty handed and extremely disillusioned... I could barely hold back the tears when I was in the shop and I can barely hold them back while writing this review.
But I guess it's like Jennifer says in her book; 'this shop is my way - it might not be yours' and that's exactly what it is. It's not mine.",0.0
"I have been to Route 66 two times now and I can tell you that I would not recommend this place. First of all, I have a gluten and dairy allergy. During my first visit I asked the waiter if they could accommodate my allergies and he said yes. He gave me a few entree options and I chose the veggie burger with gluten free bread and side salad. I asked the waiter twice to make sure the lunch was gluten AND dairy free. He said yes. When the lunch came and I tried the bread, I had a feeling that it tasted too good to be gluten free. Yet again he confirmed - I was safe. He even seemed quite knowledgable about gluten because he said I can't have the bbq sauce since it has bourbon in it. Fast forward a few days later and I am very sick. So I went through everything I ate and tried to figure out why I got sick. Fast forward a few days later, I go back to smokehouse for lunch. I ask the waitress for the same thing I had last time. She gave me a strange look and said they have never had gluten free bread and that their veggie burger was not gluten free. I was shocked! I got sick because of this place. She didn't even apologize when I told her about my experience. Simply put....I don't recommend this place.

"4.5 stars

My boyfriend claimed that Quality Meats has the best steak in NY, so of course I had to check it out for myself. After eating there, I have to admit that it's tied with my other favorite steak house, Angus Club.

We each opted to get the individual rib steaks. Our waiter advised us against the double rib steak for two, saying it'd be too fatty and too large for us. I couldn't finish my rib steak, so think we made the right choice! The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, pink and tender but not bloody. It didn't need the steak sauce it came with, but I sometimes paired the two together. I really wanted to finish my steak but my boyfriend wisely stopped me before I would get sick. Yes I am the type of person who would eat until the point of nausea if something is really delicious.

For appetizers, I got the bacon with peanut butter, which was the only dish I finished completely since it came out first. This was really tasty and I definitely want to try this combo at home. The complimentary bread was also great, so warm and fluffy. The corn creme brulee was delicious, but it was a lot bigger than I expected so I felt bad not finishing it. I probably wouldn't order this again unless you really like corn.

Even after all that, I still ordered dessert! We shared a dressed-up scoop of the burnt marshmallow. I loved that it came topped with a mini s'more and had a cookie on the bottom of the scoop. This was so good and had little marshmallows in the ice cream.

The only thing I was unhappy with was how closely the tables were spaced together. The two parties on either side of us interrupted our dinner, which I don't blame them for as it's impossible not to eavesdrop. It gets very noisy and I frequently had to repeat myself at a louder volume for my date to hear me. Not really a romantic date place, but QM is suited those who just want to eat a great steak.",0.0
"I've never been a fan of Turkish or Mediterranean food, so I don't eat it that often, but my friend suggested this place while we strolling through Fort Green. And I have to say, it wasn't bad! I was a little taken aback by the fact that there was definitely Italian and American foods on the menu, as well as a specialty dessert martini menu, but hey, if the food is good, then the food is good.

My friend got a salad with chicken, fresh mozzarella, and other assorted Italian dressings for a salad. The chicken was described as a ""BBQ chicken"", which I thought was odd, but my friend really liked it. I got a penne alla vodka (because I don't know anything about Turkish food, so I thought it would be a safe bet), and it was delicious.

Our waiter was nice enough - not friendly, but not rude either. The place was basically empty when we came in at around 3, but maybe it was because we came in at the in-between time for lunch and dinner. I would say my only problem with Deniz is that it had more than just Turkish/Mediterranean food, which just seems so odd to me. Also that my waiter could have definitely been a little bit better. But my experience with this place is more positive than negative, and I didn't get food poisoning like so many of the other reviewers unfortunately got, so that's a plus.",0.0
"What a disappointment overall. I love sushi and would eat everyday if I could. I've been looking for a decent sushi place in the neighborhood and this did not fit the bill. I would prefer to go to my default Happy Kitchen which is a few blocks over.

I had placed the order for pickup. I was about 30 minutes late getting out of work. When I got to the restaurant, I saw my order sitting on the counter. I asked how long my order of raw fish was sitting out in the heat and I was told about 40 minutes as it was ready 10 minutes before my pickup time. When I inquired on why it wasn't kept in a cooler or fridge, all I got was a shrug. Strike 1.

I ordered the spicy girl roll, kani salad and sashimi from the a la carte menu (toro, salmon, yellowtail, sea urchin and spicy tuna). The spicy girl roll was delicious. However, the kani salad was so-so, the spicy tuna was missing (strike 2) and the uni tasted so bad that I had to spit it out for fear of food poisoning (strike 3). The bad uni doesn't seem like an isolated incident as another yelper had mentioned in his review as well. How a sushi chef does not realize the fish he/she is serving is not fit for consumption is beyond me. It's too bad that I saved the uni for last. All I can do now is pray I don't get sick.",0.0
"I can't believe this place even has 3 stars.  I also am creating a Yelp account JUST TO POST ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THIS PLACE IS!

Food:  pretty delicious, not the best value I've ever seen.  I got the pork sliders with fried eggs on top.  Pretty good, I'll give them that, but the side salad and potatoes were throwaways.  I can also get the same quality for better prices elsewhere.  $19?  Meh.  I'll stick to a million different places in Brooklyn, thank you.

Space:  cute, but they are trying to fit in about 30% more people than they should--it is CRAMPED in there.  I'm a pretty small girl and I couldn't get into my seat without at some point accidentally passing my butt across another table.  The ""garden"" area was cold, which was not unexpected, and everyone was packed in like sardines.  Just seeing how packed it was almost gave me an anxiety attack.  They tried to seat the 5 of us at a 4-person table.  Then they charged us the mandatory 20% gratuity that is applied to groups of 6 or more.  Not cool.

Staff:  not the worst...  the hostess seemed like a nice person, but ultimately she apologetically made an active decision not to take any action to make our dining experience better.  The waiter was nice enough, but forgot an order.  The busboy was actually rude:  when I tried to get his attention, he actually shook his head at me and told me he wouldn't respond to me...?!

Ambiance:  THE WORST.  I wanted to have a lovely brunch over French food with my friends.  I actually couldn't hear them because the horrible music was so loud.  I asked them to turn it down, and they actually said they couldn't because one of the speakers was broken...?!  I guess they figured that for some reason it was absolutely necessary to have thumping club music blasting at a very specific level during Sunday brunch.  My friends and I were unable to have a conversation without screaming, and I actually felt so anxious I felt sick, so we ended our meal as quickly as we could.  The hostess said, ""Oh, when the DJ is here we play music because people start dancing.""  When I asked where they could possibly find space to dance, she said, ""On tables, chairs, everywhere, you'll see!""  This sounded like my worst nightmare and was NOT ADVERTISED ON THEIR MENU OR ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT or I absolutely never would have brunched there.  Luckily, none of this dancing actually happened--people just carried on with their brunch like normal, except with incredibly loud music accompanying the meal.

Conclusion:  If you want to have a cute French place, have a cute French place.  Don't morph into a faux-club during Sunday brunch just because you're in the Meatpacking District.  It's not necessary, it's really weird, and it's borderline false advertising.",0.0

When I stepped in, there was a nice lady who worked there that guided me through my order. When I got home, I was a bit excited to try the food I ordered. It didn't meet my expectations. The food was really cold, which bothered me a lot. I didn't even eat at least half of my food, before I stopped. So it's safe to say, I most likely won't be eating from here again.

"*WARNING* Avoid this place. The health department would have a field day with this place due to the amount of violations they have.

First, the good: The employees are all very friendly. They have a great selection of products and for the most part everything is safe. The sandwiches are delicious, priced fair, and have never made me sick.

Now, for the reality:

I've purchased expired yogurt, cheese, sour cream, milk and melted ice cream from here on multiple occasions that's been spoiled. The produce is stored improperly, in a beverage case and spoils quickly because it's not replaced frequently enough and is never misted. 

One time I purchased a small container of sour cream. When I got home I opened it up and it was moldy and congealed. I brought it back to the store and showed the clerk that the sour cream had clearly been left out unrefrigerated. I showed her the expiration date that had passed a week before and asked her to pull the rest of it, because those too were expired. She pulled some up from the back but I questioned whether those had been refrigerated properly as well, and she assured me that they were fine. I proceeded to open it up, and guess what? It was spoiled. The smell was brutal and it was clearly rotten. She called the manager and showed him and they both acted surprised and concerned and were both very apologetic. and I told them to pull it all but they hesitated instead of doing it in front of me, and ushered me to the front so they could give me my money back.

Fast forward to buying some ice cream. It was a strange texture like when ice cream melts and is then refrozen. I took it back, exchanged it for another one (I know, I should have known better...) and that one was also bunk.

Today, when going in to grab some quick spices (safe) my girlfriend noticed that on the milk the orange price tags were conveniently placed over the ""sell-by"" dates. When we peeked under the stickers the dates were all a week old. That means that they're KNOWINGLY selling expired dairy products. So crazy, malicious, dangerous and messed up.

I and my family had tried variety of dishes from this restaurant on our two visits and none of the dishes taste good. Both times we had to discard the whole foods after trying a couple of spoons.

"Yes, I made a Yelp account just to write a review for this place.

I was once an employee of Pizza Mania. 

This place is a real shithole. The owner, ""Hezzi"" is an absolute nut job. With total disregard for sensible American labor laws, he subjects his employees to long hours, sweatshop conditions,  and minimal pay. 

Hezzi is a power-tripping businessman who cuts corners, pinches every penny possible, and doesn't care about customer service let alone basic cleanliness. 

I am ashamed to have served such terrible, greasy, and unhealthy food to so many people in those 4 days. Even though I needed the money, quitting was one of the best things I ever did. Hearing the owner try to curse me off and threaten to ""take me outside and punch me in the face"" put a smile on my face and I am glad to now look back on that dark and cold time in my life.

"Wear clothes that you hate here.  Wear your laundry here.  Wear as few clothes as possible (applies to dudes and ladies indiscriminately... though you good looking ones in the latter category can feel free to wear next to nothing).

I don't make the previous statement because of some carnal desire (nothing out of the ordinary at least), but rather because you will walk out of this place with the stink of BBQ clung to not only your apparel, but your hair and breath as well... it's pretty mouthwatering, but not socially acceptable.  Kalbi scented body spray would have been a thing years ago, but alas, no dice.

Walking into this place on a cold January Saturday, you could see the glass fogged up, and the BBQ smoke wafting in the air.  The copper ""chimneys""  over the BBQ hot plates, while they add a stylish aesthetic appeal, perhaps serve more of a cosmetic purpose than anything truly functional... but whatever gives you more self esteem Miss Korea (I would love her sans high heels and lipstick... though that eyeliner she be rocking, might need to stick to that).

Party of 7 arrived sans reservations.  The lady planner I was with, Miss Thu, opted against reservations, as there is apparently an imposed pre-fixe menu with reservations.  Surprisingly, the wait for our party was relatively short, and the seven of us were soon seated and ordering the kind of soju bottles that you see Lee Hyori advertising all the time.

Some Korean BBQ virgins were with us the night I was in attendance, and I stressed that pork and beef are all you need to order... although we also got fried dumplings, the veggie selection, and the seafood pancake.  As for the meat, we got the pork belly, kalbi, pork chop, beef tongue, some other pork, and the marinated pork.  Basically, a lot of pork, some beef too.  As a rule of thumb for BBQ though, I don't get chicken, it's too expensive!

Speaking of expense, for the quantity of meat provided for the cost, you will be spending quite a bit of money per pound.  But what did you expect?  At least the quality of the pork and beef is pretty damn good.  Tender as hell, tasty sans sauce (you don't really need it for some of the pieces), the lady doing the meat flipping really knew how to cook... thank god too, as I didn't necessarily want cooking duties (overcooking stuff would be a waste of money, and undercooking would be food poisoning central.

After about 6-7 bottles of Lee Hyori soju, and maybe 10 pounds (or less) of meat, jaw dropping check in the amount of $443.  Surprising stuff, but a fun time with good (pricey) food... the booze definitely added to the end price, but it also probably helped me to stomach the bill.  So in the end, you will spend lots of money, so drink a lot here so you don't care as much... until the next morning of course.",0.0
"The cheese fondue is only topped by the chocolate fondue, which ranks only slightly below the cocktails, each of which should be sampled, preferably the evening you decide to write a Yelp review.

I mostly love this place. There are some downsides, but they're not unique to BP. It's a tiny space and a crowded area, so getting a seat is a little hit or miss. It's also small enough that when someone gets a little sick and shares that piquant melange of chocolate, liqueur and stomach bile with the bathroom floor, it kind of sticks with the place for the rest of the evening. And it's a place popular with young enough people that this tends to happen a little too often. 

Still though? It gets sincere thumbs up for me. Cozy feel, delicious food, quiet enough you can hear your date think.",0.0
"Eh - Not as great as everyone makes it out to be...the food is all very deep fried and greasy -  leaving me sick to my stomach. the bartenders are OK. They came off as pretentious to me - making several comments to me that I did not appreciate. The beers are good. The ambiance is OK - way too loud for my taste, never a place to sit at the bar- too crowded. always people hovering outside as well. I will probably skip it and go next door to E's instead next time.",0.0
"I think the Dig Inn on Broadway is resting on its laurels a bit.

Dig Inn is of course great, but I'm getting smaller and smaller portions, less and less choices and more and more oil in my food.

Today's the perfect example--I got a ""large"" salmon plate that looks deceptively like a small. What's the difference? Two scoops of veggies versus one. I think the person behind the counter needs a refresher on what two scoops should look like.

The cauliflower I got was swimming in oil after looking at the bottom of my plate I kind of got a bit sick to my stomach. All of this for $13? Really?

I'll keep going here because it's one of the best options in the area, but I've really hoped these guys would up their game lately. Doesn't seem to be the case.",0.0

There are times in life when you've had a meal at a restaurant and you wonder at which point during that evening you are going to get sick. That's the only way I can describe the experience I had eating here. They give away 25 dollar dinner certificate and no need to wonder why. The salsas are bland and awful (one is made of mayo!!!! Yak!). I ordered the snapper and it was not fresh and had a greasy film. I thought I was going to have food poisoning. My partner ordered the churrasco which was a complete joke- tiny in portion. After closing out our bill the waiter added 17% gratuity since we had a 25 dinner card. Incredible gall of these ppl. The bartender placed two drinks in front of me for the two for one specials. When I asked if he could wait bc maybe I'd wanted to try another flavored Cosmo he said it was policy to serve two simultaneously. Furthermore he told me that he would but the owner would get very angry one him. Te owner is a real douche sitting around counting money. Imbecile. Never again. In fact id be surprised if they last another 6 months.,0.0
"Well, I tried them a few times even though I saw many bad reviews. The products are okay but not any to rave about. However, last Thursday I decided to get some treats because of Halloween and lo and behold, they were shut down by the health department. There was a sticker on their door that was closed. The sticker was from the health department. So, now I am not skeptical about the other reviews where people got sick eating their products. I usually tend not to do reviews but I just thought I had to say what I saw because I am vegan and I like to find good quality products. Vegan Divas prices are on the high end and I expect a high end product.
It is just very scary to know a place was closed by the health department, I can only imagine what's going on in there.",0.0
"I love it when a company or brand uses a bad experience to learn from it, thus creating the opportunity to inspire  brand evangelism. 

Since my previous review was based on the fact I got sick off of the meal I had, I was never going to eat there again. However, I changed my mind when Camille reached out to me with a sincere message and apology. I responded back to indicate that I was thankful they reached out, but I needed some time before revisiting the establishment  because I knew I needed some distance so that the residual memories from my previous experience would not cloud the new one. Six months went by, and I decided that perhaps it was time to let ""bygones be"" and give Corner Social another try. My husband and I enjoyed a delicious Sunday brunch. I had the opportunity to meet Camille in person, and she was even more poised, professional, and kind in person. She really made me feel like the management was very concerned about my previous experience, and it was something that they were working on to improve, and never have happen again. The generosity and genuine spirit that flowed that day, convinced me that I could eat at Corner Social again. Although Harlem does have some fine eateries, I feel like this place is a great spot for the millennial crowd to congregate and have good times and great food. My husband and I watched the Ghana vs Germany game during the World Cup here, and it was awesome. The atmosphere was electric and the food was too. 

A few months later, I decided to take a good friend visiting from London to dinner here. She wanted to experience a ""Harlem Hot-spot"", so I thought it would be a good idea to bring her. I am so happy I chose to come back. The service was once again top-notch, and we decided to treat ourselves to dessert, which I had never indulged before. The sweet-potato cheesecake makes you want get up and dance. At least, that's how it made me feel. So deliciously rich. I savored every last morsel.

"I love this place!
Okay, so first I ordered a bacon egg white and feta on toasted roll, with banana pancakes (base on a review from another Yelper) on GrubHub. Super tasty! And super fast delivery! 
Then, the next day (I was home sick a few days) I ordered the same sandwich and the nuts pancakes with a large iced coffee. Consistency in the egg sandwich was great. It was hot. Also, the pancakes are still tasty! And the coffee your average iced coffee (like from a street cart). 
The delivery guy was the same guy both times, and almost too nice. You know when you're surprised the guy uses your name on the phone when he is outside and then in person remembers I was home sick and tells me he hopes I feel better. Like- am I in New York?

"I must say this is my most disappointing experience with delivery. I ordered delivery for 1 Ceviche and 1 half chicken combo with fries and salad. First, it was more than one hour since I ordered so I called the resturant to check on my order, the lady said the delivery went out and it should be by my place soon. I waited another 20 minutes. NADA. I called the restaurant and she told me to be patient because there were many orders. I told her that my order is Ceviche which it is supposed to be a cold and fresh delivery otherwise the dish can be poisonous as seafood are not supposed to be warm. 5 minutes later she calls me saying the driver is ringing the bell and no one is answering. I tell her I am downstairs and I dont see anybody. It turns out she gave the wrong address. I waited another 5 minutes to find the guy. 
Up until this point I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes to get my food. HORRIBLE. anyways i go inside to check on the food and I instantly notice that the cold dish is packed with the hot dish. AND the lime juice sauce from Ceviche was spilled everywhere. so, all of the napkins and the rest od the food had the ceviche sauce. 
At this point I am getting upset because I read Yelp before ordering and had a good feeling but I realized people were just lying. 
I dig into my chicken to eat and voila, the chicken is not cooked fully. RED area with blood all over. UGH. Ceviche was warm. WARM CEVICHE?? I never eaten that and I am frOm Lima. disgusting. Fear of food poisoning I stopped eating the Ceviche. 
in the end my food cost $25 and I only ate the fries and vegetables. NEVER GOING TO ORDER FROM HERE EVER. and if you dont want to waste your time and money, you shouldnt either.",0.0
"A bit on the pricey side but with seafood you usually get what you pay for so I prefer to spend the few extra dollars every so often on a special occasion to get top quality delicious seafood versus going to some old cheap spot where the food isn't fresh and there's a high risk of food poisoning if you know what I mean.

The ambiance isn't the best but it's ok for a seafood restaurant. For the amount of money they charge you would think that you wouldn't be sitting at a wobbly table but alas we were. I personally didn't care but my mother being the major complainer that she is asked to be moved to another table. They obliged of course but this also meant that we were getting seated in an area with a server different than the one who had previously so enthusiastically greeted us. Our next server was decent at his job but you could still get a sense that he was just going through the motions and really just did not want to be at work today. It shows, he didn't do anything particularly horrible but he just didn't go out of his way to ensure we were getting the exceptional service we were paying for. In all the time that we were eating, and it was a while due to all the work of cracking, digging, and dipping he only came by once to bring a requested condiment and never checked back up on us. 

The food was however really good so that certainly helped brighten this experience. You can always tell that your guests are enjoying their meal because the table is oddly quiet since everyone is chowing down. I was stuffed and took some leftovers home. We pretty much tried a little of everything; fish, shrimp, crab legs, and lobster. Whenever there's crab or lobster I tend to savor all the meat and neglect my sides so those also came home with me. 

I would definitely come back here and since the food was so good I will only take one star off for service and still give the restaurant overall the proper rating they deserve. I think if we had a different service this place would have the potential of rating five stars.",0.0
"Went to Dram Shop a couple weeks ago (it was just starting to get chilly) and made a note in my phone that read ""Dram Shop bad"" so been meaning to write this review for a while.
Why did I make such a note? Well my friend and I were driving around Park Slope looking to try a new bar and stopped in here. We ordered the nachos - just something to munch on while we chatted over beers. My friend actually got sick from the food and I had the McGurgles as I call them but thankfully didn't get sick.
As if that wasn't bad enough, I clearly remember having to flag down the bartender, Matt, on several occasions for plastic forks to eat the nachos, for a napkin, and lastly for the check. Was it busy that night? Nope, he was busy texting and ignoring customers. I could see that being okay if you had a bar full or regulars but new customers who are trying to engage you and you just completely ignore them? Bad form.

"My husband and I have been meaning to try Morimoto since we even got married... So for our sixth year anniversary, we decided to give it a try. (Honestly, we were so bogged down with work lately, we didn't think to make reservations anywhere until the week before... And these days, reservations in nyc need to be made exactly one month before, 28 days before... It's really become such a hassle!) 

I was just wary of going to go to  Morimoto since I haven't been eating any sashimi or sushi after suffering terribly from food poisoning from bad sushi a couple years ago in Atlantis. And, that coupled with seeing parasites at work... That people got from eating sushi.... So without knowing what I should get and just half excited about the meal, we arrived at the restaurant. But all I kept seeing on my last minute yelp reviews was Omakase... 

The host was extremely friendly and our head waitress was sweet. However, the table we were sitting at was not even a foot away from the table next to us. We were uncomfortable and we can sense that the other party was quite uncomfortable too since we can hear everything any one person said. Then, the first food server of the Omakase just threw us off. He brought out the first dish and my husband and I were just really impressed by the presentation and again, we could barely hear him since the table next to us was talking about the lady's lobster dish... I assume that the server greeted us but since we didn't respond, he very rudely says, ""I'm doing fine! Thanks for asking!"" And storms off... My husband, myself and the couple next to us all sat there with our mouths open at his obnoxious behavior. 

But, that was really easily forgotten since the rest of the service was really nice and the omakase was truly wonderful. Thank you, fellow helpers! I really have nothing bad to say about it, I really want to go have it again. We'll probably go again sometime for the king crab and maybe the Omakase again.",0.0
Ordered on seamless. The worst sushi I've ever had. Sinewy fish (salmon and tuna) and the cooked eel roll even sucked.

"Do not waste your money here! I went for dinner with my boyfriend a while back for Restaurant Week and it was such a terrible experience. I should have known from the first glance of fake candles and lack of customers to not have gone in. When we entered there was no host to greet us and we waited a good two minutes confused as to where to go. Finally, he came over and seated us in the back of the restaurant- the table RIGHT next to the opening/closing kitchen door. The restaurant was nearly empty so I thought it was a bit weird to put us there but we just went with it. 

The Restaurant Week menu was a joke because all of the steak items had surcharges. We came to a steak house to eat steak obviously and take advantage of trying a new place participating in Restaurant Week. We ended up paying the surcharges, ordering some drinks and an appetizer and our bill (with tip) was well over $130! NOT the bottom line you're expecting when you come for restaurant week... We wouldn't have cared about the bill being so high if the food and experience was better. The steak was okay but everything, and I mean everything else was terrible. The bernaise tasted like it had come from a package and was left out all day, the sides were greasy and unappealing. The food really didn't seem fresh at all. I'm not surprised to have read people got food poisoning here. 

As for the atmosphere, omg.... there was inappropriate music(90s songs R&B) playing, fake candles and no real charm to the space. When we asked the waiter if they could possibly change the music, he wasn't capable of doing this so brought the manager over. We asked him to please change the music and he gave a weird look and then went to change it to possibly worse/more inapropriate music- regae! Who plays regae at an ""upscale"" steakhouse?!

Last and certainly not least, the service was absolutely terrible- like god awful, terrible. The waiter was not professional at all, didn't seem to know much about the menu, inattentive, and just plain not trained. It was like they had hired him that day and told him throw on the uniform.

"BEWARE!

This is a real disappointment as I used to frequent this bakery.

Today I bought a piece of cake which was not only old, but MOLDY as well!! 
At first, I noticed the odd taste but since I had never bought this flavor before, I wasn't sure if this was the intended taste or not. Then half way through my cake, I peeled off the remaining wrapper and discovered green mold! 

They claim the cake is one day old but I highly doubt a cake can go moldy in one day, especially when the weather's been so cold (it's snowing outside). 

I wanted to talk to the owner (who had served me) but got a lot of random excuses as to why I couldn't talk to him or his wife.  Therefore I decided to write a yelp review instead.

"I am both befuddled and at a disarray as to how a 4 star rated Mexican restaurant on Yelp in the heart of Queens can be as bad as their food was tonight. The only thing that could have topped it would be if for some God forsaken reason I get food poisoning the next day.

Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

I think the only thing they got right tonight was cooking the food well done.

I enter the restaurant and it is packed as it should be on Cinco de Mayo. After a hell of a day I was looking forward to what many Yelpers, friends of mine, and complete stranger as one of the best taco(s) in NYC. Sadly, Taqueria Coatzingo had one of their off nights at the worst possible time to one of the most outspoken Yelper in NYC; Definitely in Queens.

The waitress who was also the hostess apparently seated me immediately after I indicated that I will be just 1 tonight. She puts me in a 4 seater only to have to ask me to get up and move to the 2 seater in a tight corner with a picture of a cock or rooster painting hanging above it. I almost felt the need at that moment to ask her what was her logic of sitting me and then resitting me in a rather uncomfortable space. As someone who has worked in the dining industry I can tell you that this is a rookie mistake. 

She doesn't look like a rookie to me...and with the amount of Asian patrons that were in the restaurant eating at the same time I was, it couldn't be a race thing. Could it be a fedora thing?

I came for 1 thing and 1 damn thing only. T A C O S. I ordered 9 DIFFERENT TACOS. Everything except for tripe and lengua (tongue). I'm glad that I saved that extra $5. Shame I couldn't save that $30 (tips included). 

EVERY SINGLE TACO WAS BLAND AS FUCK. Guacamole? Meats? ALL BLAND. What the FUCK happen? Did you forget how to season? Was the real cook on vacation? Was it April Fools? 

We're in May for FUCKSAKES...

The meats were all dry as well. The one exception to this was the spicy cubed chicken taco and the regular chicken taco. The tacos served with lemon wedges...Was there a lime shortage AGAIN???

I tried my best to try to rectify the situation by askjng for hot sauce hoping that it would save these sad tacos. It took only another 7 minutes to wave down the waitress.

The hot sauce came. It reminded me of Frank's Red Hot except without the red ir the hot part. Just Frank like getting dicked. That was pretty much the last straw for me. I asked for the check and I guess the waitress noticed all the semi partial eaten tacos and asked ""Is everything alright?""

At this point all I did was asked for the check once again, paid and left.

The best part of mymeal was the salsa that came with the tortilla chips. The salsa dip was very good and fresh. That was how they earn 1 star. The 2nd star? No diarrahea...yet. still pending.

The other sad thing is that as much tacos as I ingest weekly, I would have loved to have been a regular at this place. I wouldn't even give them another shot even if the food was on the house. Once was enough. 

Worst Cinco de Mayo EVER.

"Unfortunately the pho wasn't satisfying for my taste. They have one or two basic meat pho and that's it - no other variety or vegetarian option. Most people don't complain about too much meat but that's how I found Obao's pho - way too much (brisket and sliced) beef and not enough noodles. I hate wasting food but I got sick of eating so much beef that I couldn't finish it. Flavor of the broth was fine but they should balance the dish out more. 

The space is really nice - very big, cool wood walls and light fixtures. Service was not great though - we arrived just before the early dinner rush (5ish) and only 4 tables filled. But it took almost 15 minutes for someone to take our order and give us water when there were at least 8 waiters/hosts/bussers just standing around the POS system. Maybe they were meeting to go over things before the dinner rush but that doesn't mean they should make the people who are there wait.

"When I turned 30 this year, I realized with a bang that my time on this earth is limited. I don't have time to waste on things I hate: bosses, work, small talk, vegetables. I have to focus what little resources I have on things I love: ice cream, pizza, ramen, ice cream. 

Sundaes and Cones is the best. I have traveled the world and braved obesity, heart disease, food poisoning, ridicule, diabetes, and here in NYC even poverty, to try every ice cream option imaginable so I can come back and bring you the news that, without a doubt, Sundaes and Cones is the best. In the world.

Even as a classicist when it comes to ice cream flavors, I just can't resist the stuff they come up with: Thai Tea?? Lavender?! Come smother my face with this ridiculousness, please.

I don't know how they do it, what kind of dark magic they use, but all the ice cream here have simultaneously the 2 characteristics of: 1) so creamy that all you want to do is swim in a pool of it, but you wouldn't be able to move your limbs due to the thickness and would therefore drown and die (but what a way to die); and 2) intense flavoring that reach out with their little dairy fists and punch you in the face. I went in to try the pumpkin today, and the coconut. I was definitely punched. Ohmigod. Assault me. Assault me good.

If you still insist on trying Xian famous foods, go to another location, or try this once and tough it through the oncoming food poisoning you're about to experience.

I'm not one to anonymously put restaurants on blast for things I was offended by, but I had to say something about this:  Today I went into Lunchbox to order a breakfast burrito, and I noticed they were scrambling their eggs using the steam wand on their espresso machine, but not wiping or soaking the wand between steamings. They left cooked eggs to cool on/in the wand between every batch then steamed the next batch with the lukewarm eggs.  If you've ever been a barista, or have taken a food prep course you know that this is, essentially, a bacteria factory.

"I'm giving this Benihana one star -- and only because the cook was apparently great and the server was decent (I wouldn't know because I ended up eating at another restaurant while the rest of my party was at Benihana). This was unquestionably the worst dining experience of my life -- this includes a horrible experience I had with food poisoning at a different restaurant several years ago.

Around three weeks ago, my husband made reservations for a party of 12 at 5:30pm on Saturday, January 25th as part of our daughter's 9th birthday celebration. We arrived a minute or two before 5:30pm, checked in with the hostess and were told it would be a few minutes. We asked if it would be possible to check a few items because we had 10 kids with assorted bags/sleeping bags for a sleepover later that evening. The hostess stated that they only took coats; my husband asked to speak to the manager, who rather bluntly and rudely told him that it wouldn't be possible to check anything. My husband explained that we would then need to haul everything to the table and that it would take up quite a bit of space. Blank stare from the manager. 

The hostess then told us that a few tables were opening up and we should be seated shortly. Fifteen minutes later we were still waiting and my husband approached the desk to check on the status of the table. Apparently the tables they were waiting on had not cleared out. Around 10 minutes after that we checked and were told there were other parties with reservations at 6:30pm (this is at around 6pm, mind you) that effectively had priority seating over our party.  We explained (again) that we'd made 5:30pm reservations. The hostess then stated that the 6:30pm reservations were for private rooms and that those parties would be seated because an advance deposit had been made to secure their tables. I plainly told her that we were never given that option during ANY of the calls my husband made. She also stated that the manager would do what he could to see about moving the people along at one of the tables that had yet to move. My husband then called Uncle Jack's across the street to see if they had avaiblity to seat our party -- they did -- but our daughter wanted to celebrate her birthday at Benihana, so we decided to stay and wait it out. 

Another 15 minutes dragged by and my husband checked again with the two hosts at the front-- blank faces with no promise of a time. At this point about it's around 6:10pm and the kids are starved. My husband, one of the most patient people I know, is irate and stated that the horrible service we'd received was just unacceptable. The 'manager' told us that a table had (suddenly?) opened and we were told to go up.  We arrived at the second floor and walked straight into another hostess stand. They asked for our name and apparently they didn't see a record of our reservation -- my husband made the reservation three weeks prior to the dinner and reconfirmed three times. 

Luckily, the manager on that floor seeed a bit more reasonable and after hearing our story he told us that there were tables and that we'd be seated. He also offered to store the kids' bags for us - interesting since we were told downstairs that it was not going to be possible for the restaurant to do that for us. 

After about 2 minutes, a hostess escorted us to the table; I could  tell right away that it was going to be tight. I spent about 5 minutes trying to squeeze everyone in and it was clear that not everyone would fit. The hostess stood at the opposite end of the table from me without helping while I did my best to move chairs and children into place. During that time I kept telling the hostess that I didn't see how we would all fit. She insisted we had to squeeze in.  I finally asked her how many people fit at this table -- she calmly said that the table seated 8 but that they made an exception for our group and 'squeezed us in'. WE HAD A RESERVATION FOR 12 and made that clear from the time we walked in the door. My husband reconfirmed it three times in the weeks  leading up to the party and never once was the option of a private room encouraged for a party of our size nor were we told that there doesn't actually seem to be a true reservation system in place at Benihana. 

I ended up eating alone at Uncle Jack's across the street. The limousine that we'd booked to take the kids back to our house for a sleepover sat and waited one hour for us - one hour that we paid for and that we lost because of the unbelievably rude, blase, indifferent, incompetent and unhelpful staff at Benihana 56. Did I mention that the kids weren't able to eat their dessert because we were rushing to get to the limo and back home? The entire experience was like something out of a sitcom or maybe a Greek tragedy. Save yourself the time and money - $315 bucks for 11 people, ten of whom are 9 and under, by the way - and hit up a decent dining establishment.",0.0
"I loved this place! 
Everything from the amazing NYC vibe, cool ambiance, open view, and the most wonderful Hudson River makes this place a must. 

It's an old vessel turned into an open dining, bar, hangout spot.  They've kept a lot of the decor from the actual ship. My friends and I walked around it was pretty amazing how this old vessel is now this awesome spot with a night club downstairs. 

There's three levels to this place. The night club on the lower level, the main level when you walk in which is also the largest for seating and then the top level. The top level has the best views of the city but space is limited so if they're at capacity keep checking in and they'll eventually seat you. 

The drinks are okay... I would pass on the sangria and get a bucket of corona. There's def more alcohol in the beer then the sangria and you're paying roughly the same thing. 

Can't tell you much about the food but that it smelt great. 
This is an awesome spot! Highly recommended on a Sunday afternoon to just relax, and enjoy great weather.

"4 fried pork and chive dumplings for $1(!)... What could there be to complain about?! I, too, like a reviewer below, was concerned about getting sick off $1 goodies, but thankfully they went down well! 

They are delicious, although I might try boiled next time because they are quite oily when you get the fried ones.

Great flavour, great value. Totally makes up for being in a tiny room barely being able to move whilst someone behind the counter is yelling at me for my order. Would totally recommend! :)",0.0
"This is your REAL HOLE IN THE WALL eatery, where you look at this place and wonder if you're going to get food poisoning for that delicious 4 dumplings that you only paid a meager $1 for. We came here when there wasn't a line and without the crowd, you wonder if the yelp reviews will hold up, it tested your faith in yelp and makes you wonder if you made the wrong choice, if that $1 is going to give you a beautiful stingy nightmare and a date with the toilet later and hope that there's enough toilet paper to last you through the night...

I'm glad to say, that it was well worth it and there was NO FOOD POISONING, but I understand that those who are new to this wondrous hole in the wall dumpling place would wonder if the price was worth it. Truly, the pork and chives dumpling fried is as good as you would have it anywhere, even if you paid much more for the same old traditional dumpling, so I'd give it a try...maybe just order 1 small order if you're concerned for your well being. 

But you won't be disappointed, when nothing happens to you hours later and all is good and well, you'll want to go back for more. By late evening, they tend to sell out of a lot of items and only serve the most popular things, so go early if you want to have more options. 

I have to say, this place really amazed me, it's dirt cheap and absolutely satisfying.",0.0
"I never write reviews on here but I felt it was a must. This is now the second time I have got food poisoning from wild ginger. Each time I have been ill for days.

"Came here for an early lunch with a friend. There were only three other tables when we went there (12:45 pm on a Friday afternoon). I ordered the Chriashi which had passable, fresh cuts of sashimi. Mind you, this was a week ago and I did not get any food poisoning, so that may attest to the freshness of the fish. More on that later...
My friend ordered a spicy tuna roll and she said it was okay.

Now to the fun part.
There was a man seated beside us who was complaining incessantly about his roll not tasting very fresh and he was talking a little condescendingly to the waitress. In my head, I was thinking how I did not have any complaints about my SASHIMI (whose freshness cannot be masked by any sauces), and this guy was ranting about his roll. Anyway, to each his own right?

Overall, it was a good experience and the food was enough to fill our stomachs. Might check it out during dinner time.",0.0
"This place is extremely overpriced and the customer service is a little cold.  I can get the same-quality food at Wholefoods for cheaper.  Their sandwiches are not bad.  My favorite is the veggie burger.  Their chocolate brownies are also good, but expensive for a pastry.  Avoid the buffet if you can.  The food gets cold fast and I know people who got sick from eating it.  If you're going to eat here, stick with a sandwich or panini.  Otherwise, find someplace less expensive instead.",0.0
"BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING AND ROTTEN MEAT!!!
My family have been regulars at Mel's ever since it opened -- we found the burgers excellent, drinks good and fine service. But we have now had two scary experiences that have made us flee the place for good. First, a few weeks ago we ran into some good friends eating with their young kids at Mel's -- also regulars. But after eating a burger their 6 year old son wound up in the hospital with severe food poisoning, had to be re-hydrated with an I/V. This scared us a little, because Mel's was the only possible cause (aside from the burger, everything else he had eaten was shared by the family and no one else got sick). But we thought, well, something like that can happen anywhere, it's just a fluke and we love the place. So tonight, we went back. I ordered my usual, a Cadillac burger. The minute I bit into it I almost spit it back into my plate. The meat was rotten. The smell was so strong I almost threw up. I have NEVER sent back a burger in my life, or any other dish for that matter. I asked my husband to smell it and he was revolted as well. We immediately sent it back. Our waitress handled the situation well, but the manager did not even come over to the table to apologize and we left the restaurant determined never to return. Beware, because it is clear that despite the apparently good quality of the ingredients Mel's does not follow good food safety practices and you can get sick or be disgusted by your hamburger. So sad, because we loved the place but we definitely will never go back after these experiences!",0.0
"It sounds like it could be worth it to try North River for brunch, but our dinner experience was disappointing.

This was a belated birthday dinner while my friend was visiting. Unfortunately, we didn't make dinner plans with enough advance research, just decided to pick something in the East Village on the Open Table App while we were out museum-ing. I usually spend way too much time researching to pick out a perfect place to eat for all diets and budgets involved, but that day I decided to relax, go with it and just trust the number of stars the restaurant had. First mistake.

We made reservations here for 7pm on a Friday, we arrived about 10 minutes late but that was no trouble, the restaurant wasn't too busy at that point. We were seated and made our cocktail orders, which then took awhile to arrive. The cocktails were OK, I've had better. For food--we really loved their homemade bread, and as an appetizer we ordered the Charred Broccoli with a spicy hollandaise dipping sauce, which was delicious. I ordered Roasted Chicken Breast which I really enjoyed. My friend is a vegetarian and she ordered a squash dish, which she said was bland and boring. My Boyfriend had the burger, which he ordered medium and it came out bloody. 2 strikes

We had like 4 different servers or food runners through-out the night, it felt chaotic. I can't remember if our original server did in fact  check back in and ask us the requisite ""everything look alright?"" follow up to our food arriving, but if he did it must have been before that burger had been bitten into and we then we didn't see our server again for a while, long past the time when we would have been willing to wait for them to replace it.  He tried to eat it but stopped not quite half-way through, not wanting to get sick. (My boyfriend and I are usually sheepish in these sorts of situations, we would have said something if they chance presented itself but with the chaotic service, that chance didn't arrive. By the end of the meal we were feeling frustrated and after a another unintroduced server dropped off our check we finally decided to flag down our original server to take care of burger-gate once and for all. He did take it off of our bill and we were glad that we asked.)

We were seated in the rear of the restaurant, which in my opinion is sort of lame in the design department. Cheesy decorations with old books laying around, and faux-painted tables to make it seem homey I suppose, but certainly not a unique concept. Even the bathroom was decorated with books, like they installed a toilet in an old parlor room or something, Come on! The light fixtures in the front are nice and give a warm and inviting street presence, but it is too bad that they didn't carry that all the way through the space.

This place made me feel like my old habit of over-researching dinner plans has proved itself worthwhile.

3 friends and I came here after enjoying a yummy dinner (which resulted my my getting sick...but I'll get into this on that restaurant's review) nearby. Our intention was to enjoy dessert and perhaps have a wine nightcap.

Upon entering we were guided to a nice bench, given menus and served water. I noticed their pretty awesome draft beer and wine menu and made a mental note to come back and check them out...but our main goal here was dessert. Out of the group of 4, only 3 of us were in the mood for dessert and there were exactly only 3 types of dessert on the menu...so we got them all.

The dessert du jour was Red Velvet Cake, I ordered their Tahitian Vanilla Crème Brûlée and my other friend ordered their Molten Chocolate Cake with whipped cream. Each item was $8.

We legit waited 46 minutes for our desserts to be served and when we asked about it our waitress wasn't apologetic in the least. In fact, her response was, ""I told you it was going to take awhile. Do you still want them?"", my group and I were flabbergasted - we never had a heads up that our order were going to take almost an hour to arrive. Had I known, I probably would have just ordered a beer.

The dessert presentations were all very pretty and all came with a rose made out of cut up strawberries and chocolate syrup as stems. My creme brûlée was ooookaaaaay. It wasn't impressive, but it was okay. 

The red velvet cake was disappointing on few different levels. The icing was meh, the cake itself wasn't very moist and it was a tiny round portion - we were expecting a slice of cake...a generous one given the $8 price tag. This was a tiny little cupcake sized portion. Pffft. 

The Molten Chocolate Cake was easily the winner in this trio and as delicious and as decadent as it was, I wouldn't endure the painful service just to order this again.

One of my friends also ordered a sparkling rose wine and that took like 20 minutes to arrive to her (I think we had to ask about that too) and when the waitress came over and poured it in front of us, it wasn't what my friend ordered. It was a flat rose. We pointed that out to her and 5 minutes later she returned with the correct bottle. 

I felt that considering that we were still waiting a ridiculous time for our desserts, and the rose wine and she poured the wrong one, the waitress should have just left the flat wine and comped it. Her attitude was simply unapologetic and there was no semblance of customer service. 

Given our experience here and how there are plenty of cool places in this part of Sunnyside, I don't think I would return or recommend it to anyone...it's a shame too because my friend (who had the wine issue) that suggested Claret Wine bar really likes and is a regular patron here. But I'd only return if I was with friends who really wanted to.",0.0
"Disgusting. Avoid at all costs! I just paid $11 for raw meat and the lowest quality sweet potato fries you can find. Check my picture of the burger. And I wasn't even asked how I wanted it cooked. I just hope I don't end up with food poisoning or e-coli or something.

I went up to order and asked for the Brooklyn Au Poivre and the woman kept asking if I wanted chicken for some odd reason. More than once... I had a feeling my burger experience was gonna follow that same low IQ pattern but I went ahead and paid anyway. No question some of the worst stuff I've eaten in my life. My mistake for not consulting yelp first :(",0.0
"TRUE LIFE: I am addicted to Dos Toros Taqueria.

I've lived disturbingly close to DT for several years. I tried Dos Toros before I tried Chipotle, and I can honestly confess that Chipotle has NOTHING on Dos Toros- not even in the slightest, and I can't see how people can even compare!!  

Let's start with the ingredients: the Carnitas, Carne Asada, and Pollo are all amazing.  Fresh, delicious, and I trust that it's fresh and won't give me food poisoning like Chipotle has before.  I didn't used to eat pork until I tried the carnitas here, and now I have a full on obsession with it!!!!! I eat here at LEAST once a week just to satisfy my carnitas craving.  It is so juicy and delicious and has never let me down.  

My usuals are quesadillas or salads.  I'm not a huge eater, so the burritos and bowls can be a bit much for me, but they are nonetheless delicious (I've tried everything).  The quesadilla allows me to enjoy the juicy delicious flavor of the carnitas, complemented with the melted cheese, hot sauce, and guac, but not overwhelm it. 

The tacos are also great, especially if you want to have more than one meat.  Be careful though, tacos can add up to be a LOT of food, since each comes with cheese on the bottom already.  Add a hefty amount of meat, salsa, guac, etc, and it can be quite filling. 

The hot sauces are also great.  I gotta have a ton of spice on my food, and I usually have both the verde (medium) and super hot red sauce on my meal. Be careful, the super hot red sauce is HOTTT.  One little line of it down your meal will satisfy your heat. 

Guac, I'd give it a B+, it is good, but too much of it on your meal can cause it to overwhelm it since it doesn't have an intense flavor, but still- who can say no to guac?!",0.0
"Well I have been going here since it opened. I got to know two of the owners. I love the diners in New Jersey so this right around the corner was a dream come true. I haven't seen the brothers there in quite awhile and have noticed changes in the quality. It is slipping! Just little things here and there until tonight. I went in to get desert for me and some friends who are visiting and ordered three cherry danish and one blue berry. I asked if they were fresh...waste of time...the answer to that is ALWAYS yes. When he lifts one exposing a chocolate one under it I see what I think is coconut flakes on it until I notice they are moving!!!! I FREAKED because I was about to take fly larvae home to my friends!!! The waiter promptly threw out the pastry and actually asked if I wanted something else....great training for someone serving food! Almost as scary as the larvae. TASTE is second to TRUST if I can't be sure you are presenting me with safe,fresh,correctly prepared food to ingest then what am I paying for ....FOOD POISONING????!!!!!!!!!",0.0
"Had 30 minutes to kill before a movie and decided to stop by for a quick drink and surprisingly discovered $1 oysters for happy hour, which is before 8 PM Tuesday - Sunday.

How can you beat that deal in Manhattan? Highly recommend for a quick cheap oyster fix.

I only wish the food had been as great as the service.  It was all very heavy and oily and was probably the cause of my stomach not feeling so great after.  Not food poisoning, just was painful digesting it I guess.  The food did taste ok, just heavy.

Probably wouldn't go back since I didn't feel great after eating.",0.0
"When I first started coming here, I loved it. The guys working there were very nice and really seemed to love what they do. They knew the menu well and always had great suggestions. But they started hiring new people who would leave my food a little raw and in one occasion causing a few stomach aches around the house and in a house with a Crohn's patient, that's a no-no!
But we're masochists and we went again. This time no one got sick but the food didn't taste like anything. Now the third strike was this week there I tried to order a salmon dinner with two sides and they said I had to take a vegetable side after having to help her understand that I wanted two different sides and not just two of the same, I decided on a regular side (Mac and cheese) and the potatoes. The lady at the register told me that potatoes aren't vegetables because they had to be cooked. Which made no sense so I changed my order to a Patrick Ewing, because who has time to argue about vegetables? I waited 48 minutes for some fried fish and fries. 

Sadly I will not be coming here again, I would rather just walk to another fish market or trek it to city Island until they get their stuff together.",0.0
"This review is for a catering order I made earlier this week for an alumni network event at my job. The prices were a bit high but I went for it!

Lamb kebab tray: super juicy and very flavorful
Falafel tray: the crunchiest falafel I've ever had in my life. good flavor
Mediterranean salad: eh..it was just average

This came with rice, the YUMMIEST bread, and a bunch of sauces (tahini, yogurt, spicy).

The food itself was  good and they were generous with the portions. The manager who took my questions was very friendly. HOWEVER, I specifically asked for delivery at  7pm, as we had an agenda and the dinner break was not until then. The delivery man came around over an hour early. The food was still warm when we were ready to eat, but what if I hadn't been there to receive the order? What if someone got sick because the food sat out for awhile?

"So I've been hanging out in Astoria now for roughly about almost 3 years and am familiar with the Long Island City/Astoria part, the Steinway area (my fave!) and the Broadway into Ditmars part. I've seen Doyle's bar and walked by it now for almost a year and a half at this point...since July when my boyfriend moved up the block from this bar. 

It looks like a regular, Irish pub from the outside - charming, yet being a Manhattan native I've seen my share of Irish pubs and each time I walked by I wanted to hop in, but didn't because well...no real reason, but with so many bars in the area we just never made it in here.

Last Friday I went to my beau's apartment from work, he wasn't home as he was doing laundry to prepare for his bestie from CT who was visiting and staying over the next day. We went in the direction of the Laundromat but realized we had 35-40 minutes to kill. He was flushed, a little clammy and not feeling so great. Wasn't entirely sure whether or not he had a fever, but definitely sure he was a little sick or coming down with something. 

He wanted a Hot Toddy and felt it would help make him feel better. I wanted an ice cold beer as I had a rough week, so I suggested Doyle's since it's on the corner and right by his Laundromat. SO HAPPY I did. This charming pub has many redeeming qualities:

1.) Newly remodeled - I had never seen the inside before so I honestly can't speak as to what it was like before, but now it's got comfy booths, dim sexy lighting (not too dark, just right!), simple/minimalistic light fixtures give it a nice, classy pub feel - was totally surprised as the outside (in my opinion) doesn't match the inside, this isn't a bad thing - just an observation.

2.) Bathrooms - Yes, this is a QUALITY. People go to bars to drink, drinks make us want to tinkle. Being able to tinkle in a clean bathroom is all too often a luxury at a bar. I literally stopped in my tracks when I entered a clean smelling bathroom with a squeaky clean new steel sink & faucet, clean toilets, perfectly kept stalls, no graffiti or etchings...it was amazing. One of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen at a bar. Awesome.

3.) Prices - Food menu is your average Irish bar foods, but everything sounds pretty delicious and I've heard that the Irish Nachos here are to die for. I'll definitely check them out next time I'm here. My boy's Hot Toddy (and other cocktails) are $6 (not awful, especially when it's heavy handed and well made). Jameson on the rocks is $6 and beers on draft (imported and domestic) are $6 all day, every day and I was really impressed to see Blue Moon's Agave Nectar on tap here along with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (a Hefeweizen style beer brewed by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan in Freising, German) which I totally got my boyfriend into. He described it as ""oooh, that's refreshing!"" and he's right. Not many Irish bars have a spectacular draft beer selection, kudos Doyle's :).

4.) Friendly Bartender - Friday night the man in charge of the bar was Brendan. Brendan is friendly a hoot and gave me a generous sample of Blue Moon's Agave Nectar in a pretty crystal class. He also makes a MEAN Hot Toddy. If I remember correctly he also had a light Irish accent. Winning.

Doyle's is a real neighborhood bar and a great place to WATCH SOCCER on their wall-mounted flat screens, enjoy some food and have a good time away from college frat boys and other annoying folk. 

Also the jukebox here is FANTASTIC and was churning out awesome music - any bar that plays Johnny Cash and Arctic Monkeys gets several golden stars in my book. Love this place and will probably be a regular in no time :).",0.0

"Cute tea store. Very nice waitress, but mean hostess who wouldn't let us sit upstairs where the nice tables are. The waitress later on accommodated our move upstairs after seating some other people upstairs (they initially said no since the downstairs wasn't filled yet). 

It's a nice tea place, but I had better tea service in LA (refills on tea, tea leaves actually in the tea pot). We ordered the Mad Hatter (breakfast version), which came with 2 scones (ham + blueberry), pot of granola + yogurt, and 2 eggs. The eggs were tiny! When they first brought the tier out, I thought they forgot an egg, but on closer inspection, turns out it was just that the eggs are small. Lots of granola! I got sick of eating the granola towards the end. The ham score was meh, could have been moister. The blueberry scone, however, was very good, especially with the clotted cream and jam. The tea was alright - I wish I didn't go with what the waitress suggested (peach tea), since it wasn't very fruity or bright like how she described it. My friend's tea, on the other hand, was very fragrant (like jasmine). I thought there wasn't going to be enough food, but we could barely finish, and had to take 1/2 scone each to go (also didn't finish the granola).

We live close to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and it's so hard to find good Knaffe even with the large arabic population.  The restaurant where we used to get it closed and the bakery we frequent just doesn't have it as good.

Got sick when I got home so I knew gluten got put in there somewhere.  Maybe after we complained about the salads?  
I went back the following week because my mother wanted to eat there for her birthday.

"I would definitely think twice before ordering from this place.  I ordered from them for the first time this past Wed night (Apr 8) through seamless.com.  I ordred a cheesesteak, mozzarella sticks and tiramisu.  I know - what night of healthy eating, huh?

Anyway, food arrived around 7:30pm.  The cheesesteak was very unimpressive.  Steak had a weird taste to it.  Bread was slightly stale.  Mozzarella sicks were rubbery.  Tiramisu was not good.  It was a slice of a tirmisu cake, not an individually made tiramisu cup that I'm used to with Italian places.

The worst part was that about four hours later at 11:30pm, I began feeling nauseous.  Stomach cramps mostly.  Went to bed but felt horrible and could not sleep.  Eventually had to get up and had diarhhea twice within 20 minutes.  Shortly after that, I violently vomited.  Threw up a lot of the D'Angelo's food I had eaten.  Vomited again five minutes later.  Had more diarrhea.  Tried to sleep but had such stomach pain, all I could do was lay there and try not to think about it.  Woke up the next day with all-over body aches, more stomach cramps, more diarrhea.  Actually went to a gastroenterologist.  Described my symptoms to him.  When I told him I had eaten food I got from delivery around 7:30pm the night before, he said he was sure it was food poisoning from that food.

At any rate, it's now Sat morning (Apr 11) as I write this, and I'm only NOW feeling about 100% back to normal.

Second, after 9 pm they have this crackhead looking woman sitting in the entrance (blocking our view, by the way), and charging people an eight dollar cover charge!! For what? To see a bootleg band called mas halla!!! Third,  when we sat down the waitress handed us the dirtiest menus I have ever seen. I mean come on, can't you print out new ones and laminate them? Nooooo instead they have corrections of prices and menu items made with a sharpie. Lol I mean ghetto. The only good part was that I drank like seven beers, a Cuban sandwich 2 margaritas and it all came out to 37 dollars... so for that I gave them the one star. Never again. Wait there is more.....the bathroom OMG!!! Dirty dirty dirty, and if by any chance, you need to go #2 probably because of food poisoning,  you're out of luck.... no toilets just urinals. Haha, dim lighting probably to hide the dirt, heater on a table, people smoking weed at the bar. I don't know how this place has lasted 10 years. I guess Latinos aren't to keen on going to a good clean bar with good service and great food. That is all.",0.0
"We were trying to find a new place to try, and this definitely was a good choice. We were going to go Joe's Shanghai, but we found out that their Midtown location was closed indefinitely due to a roach infestation.. We weren't trying to risk food poisoning even though it was a different location. 

Anyway, the food was superb! It looks more of a 'hole-in-a-wall', which makes it even better. Best xiao long bao to this date! I love their szechuan wontons; they are super tasty. Definitely will be back again! 

Mott St. is an awesome location, too. TenRen's is down the street. :) Bubble tea is usually pretty good for dessert.",0.0
"Whole-y Moly. 

The BIG Negative:
We purchased meat here on several occasions only to discover it was spoiled after making the long trek home. We sense a trend...

Maybe we're the stupid ones who keep going back... What we found most appalling was the lack of sincerity from the management, who seem rather complacent at serving spoiled food. One customer service rep said that they had similar issue(s) with other customers. What they should do is simply inspect all the meat they sell, food poisoning kills!

The positives:
A good selection of gelato ;) which is very hard to taint.. here's to hoping",0.0
"I had been to another dim sum place not far from here, and a few of my friends got sick from the food here, so I opted to try this new place Golden Unicorn. Wow were we impressed! Everything we ordered was hot, and divine. The staff were quick about service and bills and we somehow stuffed ourselves in a matter of only 20 minutes. Though I do wish we had been able to sit and linger longer over our food, this is a great place for a quick and beyond delicious meal. Can't wait to come again.",0.0
"Sizzler is a perfect example of setting reasonable expectations and not being disappointed. It's a grease pit in Queens where you can go and spend low double digits for steak and shrimp. Are you going to have the best meal of your life? No, probably not. Is the salad bar going to be healthy and organic? Uh uh. Somehow pretty much every surface feels like it has oil on it. 

But the parking lot is tight- because it is PACKED. You will see diverse families of all ages here for a modest meal. The salad bar is a meal in itself and I MAY have eaten five of those delicious, piping hot fried chicken wings. We were beckoned by a nostalgic family member with baller status who rented out the party room. And you know what? We survived, and no one got sick, which is more than I can say for some other places.",0.0

They have so many choices here from sandwiches, panini's, burgers, fries, onion rings, Korean, japanese, chinese stir fry, pizza ...

They also have an extensive drinks selection of coffee which you can see when you walk in. It's like a mini little supermarket in a food area.

The workers here are nice except that guy that makes sitr fried food. He was very pushy and had attitude when I was trying to order. Ever since then I never went back to his section.

The fruit salads here are a bit expensive, the fruits weren't even ripe.

"Best place ever. When I lived in the neighborhood I was there at least once a week. The service is great-Jared and Barry are the best bartenders/ people and Sam and Emily just brightens your day. But most importantly the food is amazing! I've never had a bad meal there and I've had thousands of meals there.

"Solid local eats. I've never been disappointed the two times I dined there nor got food poisoning. I went on Monday night and we sat quickly. We started with guacamole and chips and a bottle of Modelo. The chips weren't oily or stale and the guacamole wasn't overpowered with cilantro it was just how I like it. 

Eats: we had the goat taco and supreme taco (chicken). Goat has a gamey flavor and not dry. Same goes for chicken. You do walk out of cravings goat tacos days later. One supreme taco would've been filling enough. It was pure gluttony. 

Dessert: we wrapped the meal with flan. We found it a little dry but still yummy. 

Total meal after : 1 guac and chips, 2 beers, 4 tacos and flan after tip was $42  a steal.",0.0
"This is the only dry hotpot place I'll go to. The staff are very friendly and helpful--they speak fluent English and Chinese and they are always happy to answer questions about ingredients or suggest combinations. I've been to a different dry hotpot spot in New world Mall and that place was just far too spicy for me. The first few bites were good, but I couldn't taste anything after that and I felt sick because of how much red oil they used. At Incredibowl, you get the mala feeling but you can also taste all the other flavors for the whole meal! Full disclosure: I got Little Spice, so your mileage may vary. My latest meal here was $14 for two people. And the $5 deposit is just to make sure you don't put their giant red bowls in the general food court waste area. Just get it to go if you don't want to bother returning it.

Also worth noting: I also feel really good about their food storage. You know how some places in Flushing can be a little sketchy in terms of food storage/handling? No concerns here. They use shallow trays and only bring out enough so that the food isn't just sitting there.",0.0
"Walgreen's bought Duane Reade a couple of years ago, which raised my rating of this location from ""Run for Your Life"" to ""Exhaustingly Difficult.""  See my SURVIVAL TACTICS below. 

The pharmacists are nice, well informed, conscientious, but slammed.  It helps to get to know them, as you'll want ALL questions answered by a pharmacist.  The pharmacy assistants have kind, courteous days and very surly days, but, there's no day when you can trust them for accurate information (Well, there's ONE experienced tech, IF you insist AND she has the time).  

Whether it's about medication, insurance, or their OWN records, trivial or vitally important, and even if I ask them to check again, the answers are wrong. It's consistent and serious. 

By no means are these bad or stupid people. It's poor management.  The too-small support staff is inadequately trained (I'm told the pharmacists are frustrated too). Plus, the way they try to brush off questions is so uniform that they must be directed to do so.  I've reported the problem to Walgreen's national office--no change.   

Yet, 111th is my best option now.  Disappointed when they first opened, I'd tried other places:  7 years with the dreadful RITE AID on 110th, which boasted 45-minute lines at 2 a.m., terrifying Rx errors, angry staff, and a filthy store teeming with mice, BUT was national and 24/7;  a few decent months with DR on 108 & Amsterdam, except they weren't natn'l yet + they'd shutter the pharmacy for the day if the pharmacist got sick (!);  5 years with the excellent CVS on 86th & Amsterdam until it became impractical.  Then, after a bad third try at 111th,  I went to Walgreen's on 97th & B'way, which delivered evenings and was superbly managed by pharmacist Mr. Nehru (I miss you!). He left big shoes to fill when he was transferred, but it's still pretty good. Then, sniffle!, they stopped delivering to my area (I get it--there are at 5 DRs bet 97th & 111th).

At least now 111th  is 24/7, delivers during the day, and is part of a national chain. This helps me, though I DON'T get why it's harder to fill a scrip here than elsewhere. 

After a year's experience, let me share the following survival tactics: 


1:  Never go there in a hurry.  A simple transaction can wind up resembling an excerpt from Kafka's ""The Trial.""  You'll get angry AND you'll have to come back again.  Avoid the evening rush (5-7p) when the line is long, there isn't enough staff, it's hard to get pharmacist help, and tempers flare.  Late night is my favorite, early a.m is good. Other times vary. 


2: The pharmacy assistants will automatically answer ""No, we can't,"" ""No, you can't,"" or ""No, your insurance doesn't"" to any question you ask. (Ahh, you could close your eyes and almost imagine you're in Paris). If they do agree to check into your query, 99% of the time you will get a wrong answer. It's even worse over the phone.  (Like I said, it's bad management.)

Beware: even after you know better, your reasonable nature will lull you into thinking, ""Oh, THIS question is simple and common enough for the PAs to answer.""  As soon as you realize your mistake, try to get hold of yourself.  This is the flash point where so many succumb to flailing, strangulated temper-tantrums.  If you have a sedative, take it. Then proceed to # 3. 


3:  Thank the P.A.s warmly, then quietly sidle over to the left end of the counter, where you will be within eye- and earshot of the pharmacist.  Smile and wave to let him/her know you're there, then wait with all the patience you can muster, for the pharmacist will be simultaneously:  

    (a) FILLING a prescription (maybe yours!); 

    (b) TRYING not to crack through 30 minutes of awful ""hold music"" and mocking repetitions of ""Your business is important to us...,"" piped at full volume on speakerphone, until an insurance rep comes on for the day's 27th attempt at making sense of deviously complicated Rx plans; 

    (c) STRAINING to ignore the misinformation being given to customers just 8 feet away, while remaining poised to rush in and intervene before the next, inevitable altercation erupts;

    (d)  TURNING back to the pill counter, trying to remember which prescription s/he'd been filling, then moving on to the huge stack of scrips still waiting.

As you've been undeterred, the PAs will now offer to help. Smile and wait.   As soon as the pharmacist is free, you'll get help.  On meds and interactions etc, they're very good. On the rest, you'll get an accurate answer,  though not necessarily a  GOOD one. Again, this is much easier at off-peak hours.  


4:  Check your prescription against the medication you receive.  Make sure it's the right med, and that the quantities of pills and refills are correct.  (Of late there's been a new discrepancy between refills on the bottle and in their system).


5:  If you're happy or unhappy with the service, PLEASE contact Walgreens online or by phone. We NEED a good pharmacy.",0.0
"Since I was recovering from food poisoning at TGIFridays in sheepshead bay my menu was limited and I wasn't happy wanted to try a bunch of stuff off this menu. I had the vegetable fried rice which was really good. My boy had the sesame crusted salmon which I had a bite and was really good.

We were sitting outside by the water. There was a lot of flies which was annoying. Maybe screening that area would be a good idea!

Will be back to try other things on the menu when I'm back in NY!",0.0
"This was the most fantastic experience to-date in New York. My co-worker brought me here with the entire team for a post-work dinner. She warned us ahead of time not prepare mentally and physically for the feast and, boy, was she on point. 

Flashy and seemingly cheesy from the outside, the scene gets even more conspicuous when you enter. Think - hanging red lanterns and all. We sat at a large booth upstairs, giddy as could be. 

Depending on your party size, you order various types of broth that will be placed on heaters that are scattered all around your table. We were a party of 9 and we ordered 5 broth: 2 original, kimchi, super spicy and pork bone. 

We then ordered close to 20 items off of the menu, to be dipped into the boiling goodness before our eyes. The seafood was excellent AND AND... no I did not get any food poisoning, despite the fact that we essentially paid 25 bucks for an unlimited buffet of seafood goodness. The rice cakes in the kimchi broth were also excellent.

Per my coworker, the best course of the action is to order many items and really flavor the broth even more. Then at then you order from a selection of noodles - we got udon and rice. Then let them also simmer in the extra flavored broth. Order eggs, crack them, and poach them in the broth as well - not too long, just enough so that they still are still soft.

Basically you close out the feast with the best noodles in new york. Sounds like an excellent deal to me. 

At the end, you can get a scoop of ice cream for the road.

"Judge Roy Bean Public House is just meh.  The bar seems like a decent place to grab a drink afterwork, but there are no happy hour specials.  However, the food is inedible.  I came here for a quick bite with my family after a busy tourist day in the city.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was disgusting.  The waiter said this was his favorite item on the menu, and I am not sure why. The sandwich was filled with processed ground-up chicken and made into a patty.  After eating only a few bites of the burger, I felt sick.  The other members of my table ordered the chicken wings, grilled cheese, slides and burgers.  We were all less than impressed by the food, however the fries were tasty.  

I don't think I would ever come back to Judge Roy Bean Public House despite the close proximity to my office.  The lack of drink specials and the horrible food make this place a huge turnoff for me.

"I first tried Patricia's when it was located further down East Tremont and I got sick because of the food. Went back a few times (I thought  just because I got sick the first time doesn't mean I should write the restaurant off) and I was never impressed with the food. Tried the food when they moved to the new location and my son got sick so I stopped going to the restaurant. My office has ordered from Patricia's a few times but I always avoided the food until recently. My office ordered from Patricia's a couple of weeks ago and I had a plate. The food was decent so last night, after a long day i decided to give them another shot and I am glad I did. I ordered the tuscano calamari, the fioretti boscaiola and the rib eye. Everything was delicious, I was so impressed! I don't know if they've changed chefs or what but I will be eating here again.",0.0

"After cancelling a reservation a month prior due to a poorly-timed case of food poisoning (not that there's ever a good time for food poisoning), my wife and I finally made it for dinner here with a couple of friends this past weekend. Given the tight seating - some bar seating, a couple (literally) of 2-person seats near the entrance, and one big communal table - you definitely want to make a reservation, especially on the weekends. Weekday availability is lighter, at least from what I've noticed on the website, so you could pull a mid-week walk-in if you're feeling adventurous. Getting seated was straightforward, and service once the meal started was okay. It was a bit iffy at first - a long time taking our order, and then an inordinately long time preparing the cocktails (I think the bartender forgot, or our order wasn't placed properly) - but it picked up after that.

The cocktails here are done very well, from both a flavor perspective (I really liked mine, which had the duck fat-infused whiskey) and an aesthetic standpoint (the fizz on top is in the shape of a duck...maybe why it took so long). The beer list - less impressive; when the most appealing option is Peak Organic IPA, it feels like there wasn't as much consideration but into the beer selection. For the food, we had the tasting menu as we were a party large (or small enough? I forget the requirement) to warrant it. You start out with a host of pickled vegetables, all of which are pretty solid. My personal favorite was the sliced green peppers dipped in duck broth, which cut the edge off the peppers while adding a bit of flavorful depth from the broth. We also had the fish skin chips as well, which were quite good, if a bit hard to handle (the veggies kept falling off).

We started getting into the thick of the meal after that, starting with our four appetizers. The clams were pretty solid Kumamotos, which is a nice, clean, slightly sweet start to a meal that generally didn't tend towards those descriptors. The oxtail dumplings were very solid well, with the meat cooked just the right amount and marinating in the rich broth inside the dumpling. The foie gras tarts had to be the highlight though; it reminded me of torchons I've had with rich fruit, and the strawberry pairing with the slices of foie gras were just divine - it's hard to beat the rich fattiness of the foie with fruit pairings. After that, it was on to the shots of consomme (a nice palette cleanser / preparation for the rest of the meal) and the duck, which is easily the best Peking-style duck I've had in NYC. Perfectly cooked, very crispy skin that maintains the great flavor of the duck, and very succulent cuts of meat made it a treat all around. As for the dipping sauces - I preferred the hoisin by a long shot; I appreciate the others, but it seems more like a nod to pan-Asian tastes (peanut sauce) and American Thanksgiving preferences (cranberry sauce)...or maybe I'm just a traditionalist when it comes to this! The main plates and the rice came out shortly thereafter...we stuck with the vegetarian fried rice, which was executed really well and was plenty hearty enough that no meat was no issue. While the ribeye has a supplement on the prix fixe, it was definitely worth it - cooked to medium rare perfection, which I oftentimes feel is undercooked - it had so much flavor, and such a rich marinade, that it is definitely one of the best steaks I've had in some time. The sea bass (our other main) was pretty solid, very well prepared and well-flavored, but it wasn't as memorable as the steak. In the end, we passed on dessert as nothing quite piqued our interest.

All in all, this was a very pleasing dining experience. The duck was great, and nothing really struck a bad chord with regards to taste or preparation. It's a lot of food - so don't come on a half-filled stomach - and the service may come off as a bit inattentive at first, but it really is a very enjoyable experience. With a rustic, farmhouse feel that is below street level, it's easy to lose yourself in the food and good conversation with friends. Definitely a place I'd like to come back to again to try out some of the other plates as well.",0.0
"Tiny little place, basically the size of a closet! You order while standing outside, no room to enter the ""restaurant."" I am curious to see how this will work out in the winter. 

Tried a chicken taco, a pork taco, and guac and chips.  For the price (a little over $3), I thought the tacos were large and filling.  The tacos only come with onion and cilantro, but I asked and they added lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and cheese.  Both tacos were tasty, but I preferred the chicken which was delicious (pork was a little greasy but also tasty). 

Guac and chips were pretty solid as well. 

As an added bonus, the food seemed fresh and I did not feel sick after eating it (which is more than I can say for Chipotle!)",0.0
"Food is amazing but don't eat here if you have food allergy issues. They say several things on the menu are gluten free, which was great for me. At first no problems but then I started getting really sick after eating there. Eventually after talking with several employees I've discovered the cook is an old guy who doesn't really care about or understand the food allergy stuff, and will randomly throw flour or soy sauce into things that are supposed to be gluten free. As a result I got nailed several times. Bummer because it quickly became my favourite place to eat after the first couple times there, but had to stop going after getting sick from gluten. But the food tastes amazing, so if you don't have allergy issues go for it. If there hadn't been serious miscommunications about gluten in food I've have given 5 stars. The bi bim bap is great.",0.0

Lots of comfortable seating at the lower level, especially those colorful plush seats (Please save a seat for me). You can watch the television while eating. Homey. I like.

"Went during restaurant week.  Chilled cucumber soup was not bad, but the roasted Bonita was the worst dish I've ever been served.  It came served over a disharmonious medley of bland fried pork fat(how?) jasmine rice gratin (billed as fried rice), dandelion greens (inedible, interlaced with what felt like grains of sand),and  a green oily smear dotted with what I can only assume was Hardee's barbecue sauce with added Worcestershire sauce to make it more runny. I took a few bites of the fish, which was at least not over cooked, before I tried (and spat out in quick succession) both the greens and the pork. 

The verbena mousse may've been good if I wasn't too sick to my stomach to eat it from a few bites of the fish.  I ate some plain white bread, and the ginger cookies that came with the dessert. Those were nice and helped to settle my stomach.

My companion had the Red Mole chicken, which she also declined to finish.

Two stars instead of one for the waitstaff, who were charming, but probably should've at least reduced the bill somewhat to account for the inedible slop they put in front of me.",0.0
"WARNING:  This place can be pretty rough if you have any stomach issues.

So I wrote a review right after getting home from this place.  Unfortunately, my review has to change.  I was feeling full when I got home after eating here, and it only got worse.  I couldn't sleep till 3am (I ate there at 8pm), and even when I woke up I felt like I had something stuck in my stomach.  It was a feeling of being super full, my stomach just pushing against my clothes.  Felt so uncomfortable that I couldn't sleep.  Mind you, I have GERD, but haven't had any issues for months.  Also, my friend that took me there told me her friend with IBS ate here and felt horribly sick afterwards.  I don't know if it's all the fiber but something's up.  Thus, went down from 3 to 2 stars.  Just not for me.


Original Review:  

The shakes were great, had the Red Coconut one and I could taste both the strawberries and the coconut.  Very filling, like I would have been fine with just shake.

Mexican platter was good, but I didn't care for the rice.

Overall, it was good, not extremely flavorful, and maybe a bit too pricey.  Just OK for me.",0.0
"I wish I could've loved Minetta but I think I ordered the wrong things. The famous burger was incredibly expense and heavy. The fries were incredibly ordinary for such an expensive dish: a decent burger with regular diner fries. Maybe I'm not a bone marrow fan (so take this with a grain of salt), but bone marrow has the consistency of greasy gelatinous fat with no flavor. I thought I was going to have a clogged artery after eating it. Also, it's a huge portions, so it's best to share! Expensive wine glasses ($14). Fun spot but overly crowded (people kept bumping into me when I was seated) and loud and made me feel pretty sick afterward.",0.0
"I've never left a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth and the worse part was that my husband also felt the same way.  

The food itself wasn't bad. We had the spicy appetizer and the Monkey Roll along with the Three Style sushi with spicy tuna roll.  Aside from the spicy tuna roll which was definitely fishy, the rest was tasty.  Far cry from the best I've ever hard or even delicious, but sufficient to satisfy our sushi craving if not for the fact that we should NEVER EVER EVER leave a sushi restaurant with a fishy taste in my mouth.  We were both so horrified that we feared that we had to run across the street to buy a pack of gum to get rid of the flavor and it took a while! I genuinely feared that I would get sick when I get home. 

I will NEVER return to Iron Chef.  Don't be mistaken by the packed house, there are better places nearby, namely the one across the street which is DEAD, but SUSHI is unbelievably fresh.",0.0
"We celebrated my 30th here. It was a perfect July night, not too humid just right. The retractable rooftop is what attracted us to this location and the other reviews we read about the ambiance etc. 

Pros: nice crowd. A little bit European and sexy crowd. Not pretentious at all, like a lot of the usual rooftop haunts we go to. The bottles of prosecco are like $40. Amazing deal! Music was great, and the bartenders were friendly. The view of Empire State was sick!! Makes you remember why you love New York so much!! Great photo ops.

Cons: you have to wait on a line unless you have a table with bottle service which is a minimum of $300. If you get there early enough there are places to sit without having to commit to bottle service. We had a group of 8 and we were fine. I felt like I was in college going to places like suede or limelight. Was really turned off by that. They closed up the outside / roof around midnight. So it got a little hot and crowded.

"Pretty standard take out sushi joint. I've never been to the restaurant, but my boyfriend has and he says it's clean/fine.  We've ordered take out twice.  The fish is pretty fresh. I never felt like I was gonna get sick.  The miso soup was actually pretty good.... It was flavorful and not super salty. I've tried the yellow tail jalapeno, tuna avocado and spicy crab.    Please note.... they do NOT de-seed or pickle the jalepenos before putting them in the yellowtail roll.  They just cut up a hot ass jalepeno and stick it in the roll.  Damn near burned out my tounge, (and my eyeball when I went to take out my contacts later :-/) I routinely order yellotwail jalepeno rolls and I've never had an experience like this.  It's good that the jalepeno is fresh, but please take out the seeds.  

Moving on.... my boyfriend ordered the fish katsu bento box.  It was decent... fried... he seemed to really like it. 

All in all I would order sushi from them again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",0.0
"Came here for my 30th birthday with my husband and I was really looking forward to some great lobster. However, my lobster was overcooked and rubbery.. Tasted musty and old. It was barely edible to the point where I could only eat half the tail. Left the rest to be tossed because I am 5 months pregnant and was seriously worried I was going to get myself very ill eating bad lobster. My husband's halibut was overcooked and the sauce was boring and uninspiring. We could have made this better at home. His dish came with two sprigs of asparagus. TWO. Why bother with the vegetable at all?!? The butter for the bread was salty and disgusting. Also inedible. 

I was dressed for an upscale midtown restaurant.. The rest of the customers, not so much. I felt like I walked into a happy hour bar in Times Square. The atmosphere was LOUD, very unromantic, and very little space between tables. Waitstaff even clapped loudly and sang happy birthday to another table like we were at Red Robin or Olive Garden. My husband and I waited to open an envelope with the gender of our child written inside and felt like this private special moment was being shared with the entire room we were so crammed together.

I went in starving. Left starving and worried I'd get sick. I'm upset we dumped $180 on a completely inedible dinner and ended up going elsewhere to get some small plates.",0.0
"I am only writing this review for the Green tea crepe cake. I have no idea how long the wait is or if people are rude. All I want is that green tea crepe made from 20 perfect layers of amazingness with creme and whatever heavenly magic they add to it. 

One of my friends ordered this as their wedding cake and I'm pretty sure I ate a whole cake by myself. I ultimately got fat and felt sick from all that food, but I was surely happy. As an awesome anniversary present, my gf got me a few slices of the cake again... Once more, I got fat and stayed that way ever since.

If you want to get fat and be really satisfied with life. Eat the Lady M green tea crepe cake. $8 a slice is worth a few more hours at the gym for this foodie.",0.0
"I have been walking past this place for months and decided it was time to try it. After looking at instagram photos I kinda of had an idea of what I wanted. I walked in and this place was extremely clean. The menu was simple and to the point. Staff was friendly. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, loaded tots and nutella milk shake. I know, I know i felt sick after and it was almost 20 bucks but it was worth it. I am not even going to tell you how amazing it all was. peeps the pics and go try it!",0.0
"The good:
-Huge backyard.
-Great charcuterie options and reasonably priced. Loved the goose liver pate the most.
-Good beer selection and select $5 happy hour beers.
-Nice waitresses, though a bit forgetful.

The bad:
-Backyard was closed due to rain, so everyone was crammed inside the communal seating. The place is basically two storefronts with a giant wall in the middle, so it's very narrow. There are seats at both bars, but it's better to snag a seat at a table. You'll probably have people running into you since the chairs are stools and most people are fat and careless.
-The happy hour oysters were just terrible. They were on ice, but they were basically warm. Felt like I might get sick. They were also not shucked particularly well. I would avoid.
-The bread basket that came with the charcuterie was huge, but not evenly toasted. Some pieces were just really cold, which made me afraid that they were repurposing old bread...
-Only a few beers on the happy hour menu (3 of them).

The ugly:
-Your ugly babies. Stop bringing them to bars.",0.0
"The coco acai juice was so good that I am still missing it all the way from California. I like how customers can add booster shots to any drinks. My friend felt sick that day, so we added some vitamin C or immunity booster shots into our drinks. The drinks still tasted delicious. On a cold winter day in NYC, Juice Generation was still a great choice if one just wants to feel healthy.",0.0
"WHERE IS THE STAR FOR GIANT HEARTS IN EYES?

Oh my god. Savory, crispy gluten-free fried chicken with your choice of sauces (or none). Perfect spicy kimchee tofu salad and other side-dishes. Hilariously giant portions of delicious french fries! Attentive, super-friendly service for our group, which included a small, messy baby. I didn't even get to the bibimbap, but everything I sampled from our table was crazy delicious. 

And did I say gluten free fried chicken? GLUTEN FREE FRIED CHICKEN. I've gotten sick after eating at several nearby restaurants advertising ""gluten free"" who were obviously just catering to the trend and not taking it seriously for people with celiac or a serious intolerance. Ssam appears to practice immaculate food prep, as several fellow GF friends can attest. I'll probably be eating here once a week at least.

"We walked in fairly late...around 10pm, but come on!

The pizza, which they 'heated' was cold.  They literally added water to their 'hot food' in front of us so that it didn't look so dry.  Green beans were ice cold.  

$6 salad was just a little pile of lettuce with some Fetta.  really lame. 

Food was nearly inedible.  Oh and over priced.  The only good thing is we didn't get food poisoning!

"While there are so many dumpling places and dumplings are so easy to make at home, it's very hard to rate the ""best dumplings"". For some people, the best dumplings are made by their grandmothers! However, this tiny dumpling place does have something special to offer. The price is very affordable: 4 huge pork chive potstickers for $1. ($1 pizza sounds less attractive now.) 10 boiled dumplings for $2.5. The filling is a bit small for a huge dumpling like that. The dumpling wrapper is very well made - it's moderate thick, smooth and delightfully chewy. The panfried dumplings are crispy on the outside and juicy inside. 

I saw them cutting a huge pie into pieces (@$2.5). The sizzling cutting sound tingles my every taste bud. Unfortunately I was always full on dumplings. I don't like the sour & spicy soup. The soup base was weak and the ingredients were not enough, but $1.25 for a small one. I feel thankful that they didn't put the potstickers directly from the pan into the styrofoam boxes. The hot potstickers always burn holes in the styrofoam, another form of food poisoning. Not enough dumplings on site, I carried a bag of 50 pieces of frozen dumplings home tonight.",0.0
"IF U HAVE A GLUTEN ALLERGY: DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!! They mean well putting GF options on their menu and their regular people food looks incredible but TWICE I ordered GF fair from here and got violently ill. Not one person from the cashier to the waiter clearly and most importantly to the chef understands what a Gluten allergy is. They must just offer GF pasta and pizza as an option for people who like the taste and will not get sick from cross contaminaton. 

The 1st time I got sick I ordered a GF pizza delivered to my home. 1/2 way thru my 2nd slice I was violently ill vomiting and everything else along with it :( I checked my reciept and saw that there was no ""GF"" notation so they admittedly gave me a regular pizza :( When I called to confirm they were very apologetic and as sick as I was for the following 24 hrs I chalked it up as an honest mistake.

Months later I decided to give them another shot. Itallian GF is tough to find so I tried to be optimistic. This time I went in and ordered to-go so I could relay how sensitive I am and what happened last time. They brought out the ""GF pasta"" and when I told the counter guys the pasta looks different than the GF pasta I had eaten there in the past they assured me they changed vendors and that was the GF pasta...maybe it was and perhaps the sauce on the pasta meal I ordered has flour in it and they dont know to distinguish what meals contain gluten even with one ingredient as GF...Again within the hr I was prayen to the porcelen god for the rest of the night and everything that goes with it...nothing worse than undigested food coming back up :( 

Unfortuantely, I dont think they took my 1st call seriously and Im sure they didnt take my 2nd one either. They are not GF certified in how they prepare their food and I should have known better. Some are better than others but if you are considering taking your chances on this one...dont say I didnt warn you!",0.0
"AFTER specifically stating that I do not want Avocado on my food since I am highly allergic. My food of course had avocado on it (shrimp tempura). I became terribly ill to the point that I began to vomit blood!! Once I gathered myself I immediately called this establishment to tell them of their life threatening error. I asked for a refund but of course they challenged my claim stating that it was not possible for them to have put avocado on it(the dish typically comes with avocado, I was making a special request making it more than possible for this to be true ). I told them I have it in trash and it has avocado in it. At this point I was extremely livid since I order from here at least once every other week and was quite disappointed with the way they were handling this situation. Instead of giving me my refund they said they would send me another order! Because everyone wants to eat the food they just spent the past 10 minutes vomitting!! I said fine since it appeared that a refund was not happening. When the delivery man arrived he wanted the old food back !! 
One: thanks for not believing your customer!
Two: what are you going to do with the food?! 
Three: I told you I ate it hence why I was sick !! 

I did have two pieces left but I vomitted all over the container. I told the poor delivery guy he could have it if he wanted but that would be terrible to have to carry back for they sake of their stubbornness. He began to call them at the restaurant which was when I had enough and told him they could keep their food and I was going to report them and maybe sue them.

SO after this horrible experience I have decided that I will NEVER order from here again. I should sue!!! I could of died and they handled this situation like I was at fault!! I didn't like that one bit. I literally feel horrible and they did nothing to make me feel better about the situation.",0.0
"MEAT, MEAT and moreeeee MEAT! I've been here a bazillion times and everytime I leave here, I'm sick and tired of eating meat (in a good way!) It's usually pretty crowded during dinner time on weekends from 6:30-10pm. After around 10pm, the crowd begins to slowly wobble out from their impending comatose state from all that they've consumed. The open buffet consists of every raw Korean piece of meat you can think of. You can take as much as you want on each trip to the buffet area, which is located smack dab in the middle of the main dining area, and bring it back to your table to grill. They also serve cooked foods, such as dumplings, chicken wings, corn on a cob and various soups and porridge. Lunch is always cheaper than dinner, with dinner coming in at about $30ish/person these days.

A few notes for those who have never dined here. Every 10-15 minutes, a waitress will stop by to change your charred grill and replace it with a new one. In addition, if you have any types of meats that need to be cut up into smaller pieces or sausages that need to be cut open they will handle it for you too when they come by your table. As for advice, the experienced customers will know that you should NOT wear anything you don't want smelling like Korean BBQ for days/weeks, yet I see people who wear their nicest clothing here anyway. 

Sure, you can throw your clothes into the washer/dryer, but for some reason the smell of Korean BBQ haunts you! Days after coming here, I would think that I can smell Korean BBQ on some articles of clothing I didn't even wear there! I also highly recommend not having any plans the rest of the night, like going to a club straight after eating here, unless you're going to head home to scrub yourself down for a good hour. Everytime I come to dine here, I don't wear my nicest clothing anymore. I try to minimize the amount of jewelry too (i.e. don't wear a watch, chain) or you'll be stuck washing it all down afterwards, even your sneakers. With all that said, ENJOY the aromas of Korean BBQ!

P.S. Their Sunkist oranges are the best oranges in the world. They're so sweet and ""citrusy"" so save some room for them at the end!",0.0
"TURN DOWN FOR BRUNCH. 

I gave this place 3 stars because I wish I could give it 5 for atmosphere and service but 1 for food. $30-some dollars gets you alllllll the champagne you could want at brunch. We had a huge group of 17 for a birthday party and they treated us really well. 

The turn off is that the food is pretty bad. You're not going to get food poisoning or anything awful like that, just generically blah plates that you don't each much of and then in turn, get more drunk on champagne. 

Moral of the story: YAY DRINKS AND BELTING JOURNEY SONGS AT BRUNCH. Boo food. Sorry Paradou, still love you for a crazy day!",0.0
"This is one of the best halal carts around. I never order the lamb, it's the same lamb that every cart gets. It comes in a solid block so there's nothing special about it. It's also processed lamb. I always get the chicken since their chicken is very simply prepared. It's not overly spiced or marinated like other carts. Their white sauce is mayo based since you see empty buckets of mayo next to the cart. Their salad is probably just cut up and never washed, but honestly I don't care. 

I eat here at least once a week, and never got sick for the past 8 years.

"I went back. I can't help it. I have made the executive decision that until I get food poisoning, I'm going to risk it.   I mean I don't go very often at all, so I figure the probability of having a bad dumpling is low. Touching the soy sauce and sriracha bottles is probably the worst part...but I'm going to try and use a napkin next time. The bottles have slimy feel to them, considering the hundreds of grimy people who touch them everyday, they probably are to be avoided.   But then again, if you are that risk averse, you probably are not eating here. 

So eat, drink, and be merry...for tomorrow we die (hopefully not from a bad dumpling).",0.0

"Definitely, easily one of the worst burgers i've ever had. 

I had both the truffle burger and the california burger.

The california burger is the primary reason for this bad review. 

The california burger was disgusting. It tasted weird and funky. 

It made my burger not taste like beef. I don't know what kind of sauce they put in that, but it is totally disgusting. 

I felt like vomiting after eating that. 

The truffle burger was only slightly better. It didn't have the lettuce or tomatoes . It was basically meat and bun with a freaking u stamped on it. I don't give a damn about the fancy logo if the meat tastes like crud. 

The truffle fries, god this was awfully weird tasting, its like they put too much truffle oil on it or something. tasted funky. 

I personally am insulted that the reviewers on here would give this place a 4. 

Must be either the classic or manly burger tastes better most likely. 

But the two i ordered definitely suck. I had these cooked well done though. so i'm not sure if it tastes better raw or something? 

Seriously disgusting and they don't even have mayo, they just have garlic aoli or whatever which looks like mayo. DISGUSTING!!!!

"I don't normally write 5 stars, but I really don't feel like anything was particularly lacking and I think it's a very good concept and an overall good experience. I really liked that before you get on the boat you were greeted by a friendly crew.

There's three decks in total. Only the top deck is outdoor. If you have a big group, go when they dock, which is when people leave so that your group can get a table together. The ambiance was both good for crowds and good for romantic dinners. I don't recommend bringing kids. Some lady next to us threw up either because she was sea sick or she drank too much or both. Either way, the crew responded to it well by cleaning it up right away, so that's another reason for my five stars. 

The lobster roll was no where near as tender Luke's and the bread was a very dense type of bread. But I felt that for the same price $18, you get double the meat and a free boat ride. The amount of lobster meat alone was worth 18, in my opinion.

The tiger shrimp appetizer, there's a lot! Order if you're an absolute shrimp lover otherwise, the account they give you is definitely meant to be shared.

The boat ride itself was nice, 30 minutes. If you have long hair and plan on eating bring a scrunchies, trends to get windy making eating a little annoying.

Overall I think this is a great place for dates and parties.",0.0
"I've noticed several of these boil restaurants popping up over the city and I'm doing my best to try a few of them. I thought Red & Gold was fair, nothing special but not so bad that I felt sick from the food. I went with my girlfriend and we each got a lobster boil with the works. The boils we got came with mussels, shrimp, squid, corn and noodles. The seafood was fresh and tasted good with the sauce but we both felt like the portions were relatively small. We both can knock back large seafood meals so we weren't expecting this to fill us up completely or rip any buttons off our jeans but we were still quite hungry when we left which was frustrating. We also thought the noodles could have been prepared better instead of just stuffing them in the bag. The service was very good, however, and the waitress helped us pick out the best sauce and seafood combination. I likely wouldn't come back unless they were doing some sort of significant promotion or special.",0.0
"Seeing as I don't trust Gristedes with any of my seafood selections, I decided to give La Rosa a shot and save myself food poisoning and a subway ride. I've been to La Rosa before for little things and aside from the claustrophobia-inducing floor plan, the employees are friendly and helpful. 

I bought a pound and a half of cooked shrimp even though I was put off a bit by the overly fishy smell of the seafood counter. Yes, I know it's a fish department. No, it's not supposed to be blatantly noticeable and the line of good and bad is fairly obvious to me. When I got home I rinsed them just to be safe and although they were fine, many were sloppily cleaned. I felt like David Spade in Tommy Boy -""Uggh, do you always have to de-turd these things?""

I used a little more than half and refrigerated the rest. Sure enough, the next day they'd about all gone home to Jesus and I wasn't going to push my luck. Shrimp should really keep for longer than that. Maybe I caught La Rosa on an off day and I'll still go for other things and leave the seafood to the fish market. They are cheaper than Gristedes and others on some items and the produce is quality so La Rosa is still OK by me.",0.0
"New York City food carts are notorious for taking niche cuisine and using the food cart model as a gimmick to drive sales instead of providing real quality and value. Uncle Gussy's is a Greek version of the beloved chicken/lamb over rice formula and provides what consumers want, value, not gimmicks, which has proved wildly successful with long lunch time lines and glowing Yelp reviews.

If you come during their most busy times, prepare for a 10-20 minute wait as they are popular in the area. Once you get up though, you notice that even though they serve typical halal cart dishes, they take on a much cleaner look, unlike most poorly maintained halal carts. They have a clean presentation, adapted for more discerning consumers in the Midtown area and neat menu and working area should assuage the fears of most food poisoning paranoid individuals.

But the food itself is delicious. A big serving of long grain rice, yellow, but as much as their halal counterparts, with the typical side ""salad"". They then serve a cleaner and tastier meat, which is handled with care. This is then topped with delicious onions and a subtler tzatziki yogurt sauce that complements and doesn't overwhelm the dish. This cleaner, Greek take on chicken/lamb over rice is a winning combination and justifies the praise Uncle Gussy's receives 

While nothing extraordinary, it is a fantastic lunch spot for Midtown workers. Uncle Gussy's serves a tastier, cleaner, more ""deluxe"" version of the classic chicken/lamb over rice, without having to play food poisoning roulette. At $7 a platter, it's quite the deal for the area given the quantity and quality of food. It's one of the few food trucks that provides solid value and is worth trying.",0.0

"Really? Arguably I'm slightly spoiled because I lived in LA for years. If you were to go to a place as divey as this in Mid-Wilshire or Rosemead or the Valley, you'd probably come away with a tasty meal for 7 bucks. Here you pay 10 (cash only) for a large but very bland burrito with cheap, gristly and overcooked carne asada. Some reviewers have praised the other dishes. The burrito is sorry enough that I don't think I'll go back to try the rest of the menu. You'd be significantly better off -- and spend slightly less money -- at Chipotle.

It goes without saying that the place is shabby. The only reason I've given them 2 stars instead of 1 is that they were quick, not rude, and didn't give me food poisoning. My daddy always told me never to trust an important package to a messenger service called Speedy Delivery. The same timeless wisdom may be applied to Great Burrito.",0.0

Spotted Cupcake Crew on 8/2/14, without a line and sugar craving kicked in!
Boy, was I disappointed. Rude, arrogant service, overpriced and icing that tastes like shortening with a tiny bit of chocolate flavor. The trifecta of FAIL.
I could only eat 1/2 of 2 of the mini cakes that were $1.50 each before feeling as though I had swallowed a cup of Crisco. Felt sick for the rest of the day and had to eat super healthy for the rest of my visit to rid my stomach of the greasy feeling.
I've had delicious cupcakes, I've had OK cupcakes...these are wretched, unfit for human consumption cupcakes.

"I came last night (4/8/15) at around 9pm to meet w/ my girlfriend for dinner since she works in the neighborhood.  I arrived before her and had a beer and checked out the menu.  Not long after she arrived and within moments we were seated.  

We ordered the nachos as an appetizer because nachos are fun. They did not disappoint.  

While we munched on those we took a fair amount of time mulling over the menu trying to craft the perfect meal that we could both share together.  We wanted to share two entrees and deliberated over the decision for about ten minutes while we ate our appetizer.  Our server came back and we shot him our order.  Easy and no fuss.

One order of Chicken Enchiladas and a Carne Asada burrito ""wet"" with both sauces.  Based on the descriptions on the menu and our prior experiences with the place, we were very exited about the meal we were about to receive and when it arrived not long after we were both glowing.  It was beautiful, Norman Rockwell stuff.

The food LOOKED perfect, the presentation was top notch but the first bite revealed everything to be room temperature at best.

The enchilada sauces (green and red) on the wet burrito were both under room temp and the meat and everything else inside was the same.  This was confusing due to the presence of seemingly melted cheese on both dishes.  I took a couple of bites and just sat back feeling overwhelmingly confused.  

There's nothing that really compares to the sensation of chewing on cold steak and wondering how long it's been at that temperature.

The thing that concerned me most is that my girlfriend is a T1 diabetic and food poisoning is enough to put her in the hospital for three or four days.  I've experienced this with her twice before (not from Calexico) and its terrifying.

The place was busy and the server was nice enough so I didn't want to raise a fuss so I asked for the remainder of our cold food to be wrapped up.

I've been a cook for over 10 years and in all of the places I've cooked, served, or tended bar, this would never be acceptable.  I ran into some friends who live in the neighborhood about five minutes after leaving and told them about it.  They reciprocated the exact same scenario they'd experienced about a half dozen times.  Their ultimate response was that they had to give up on the place after giving you guys the benefit of the doubt.

  If you're going to flash all of the articles about how good your food is and keep showing up on these ""best burrito"" lists and the like, expect people to be excited about the food you serve.  Also, expect them to be extremely disappointed when you serve them food that doesn't even register as lukewarm by the time it hits the table.

That being said, the beer was cold, no complaints there, but cold drinks should never be the highlight of a meal.

With tip included, $69 was spent, $18 of which went to beer.  We could really only laugh at the absurdity of our experience and left still feeling confused.

A friend of mine who runs a burrito joint further down the road on Manhattan said it best about places like this; ""They're playing baseball while wearing tuxedos.""",0.0
"I've been here more times than I can count but since I never got food poisoning yet I'm giving it four stars (*knock on wood*) This is your typical applebees; order, eat, and go. I usually split a two for twenty with a friend for some quick daytime grub and bounce. I've gotten a drink maybe 4 times in my life at this AB's. They were strong I must admit, but I just don't understand why anyone would drink at an applebees. Anyway the foods always been decent and I've never had an issue.",0.0
"Honestly this place would have received 5 stars if it wasn't for what happened today. Won't say that its a horrible place because that would be a lie. Ever since Tomo opened in my area I instantly started buying food there. Let's just say sometimes I bought food from Tomo on a 3 time a week basis. The driver already recognized my face and so did the staff at the restaurant, they always said hello when they saw me at the restaurant. When I didn't order in a while, some staff would tell me, ""hi long time, how have you been?"" Yes I ordered that much! Around April of this year I ordered some sushi, ate it and it was yummy as usual! The next day I had to call out of work because I was so ill with food poisoning. Despite of this I still ordered food from here. I even moved to another neighborhood and still ordered from there. I ordered some Philadelphia rolls today and asked for the salmon to be cooked.(The salmon is smoked) I don't like to eat anything raw. When I received the sushi some parts of the salmon looked cooked while others were raw. I called back and let them know. I was told that it was cooked and that there was no way it was not.  I felt like they really didn't care after all the business that I have given. My orders were big and not less than 25 dollars most of the time. Considering that and the fact they already recognized me I thought the would fix this by simply sending my order how I asked for it. I asked the lady over the phone to remove my info as I no longer want to do business with them. She replied with a simple, ""ok we will remove."" The reason I asked for this is because they had a habit of leaving my credit cards on file. When they would print the receipt my full credit card number would be on there! So yes they lost a customer, a really good one I truly made lots of business for them! Doesn't take away from their great food but it's also about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",0.0
"Spot was ok. Been here a few times, mostly for drinks. Decided to sit and order some burgers with my husband. His came out right and he actually really enjoyed it. I ordered the turkey burger, and thank goodness I cut it in half. Was totally undercooked and definitely would have gone home with food poisoning had I ate. Of course sent it back, waitress took it for the chef to look at and came back to say it was undercooked and a new order would be out. No apology. So 10 minutes later still waiting - which by this time my husband is done with his meal. Waitress never cam back to offer a free drink while I waited or to even check in to see if we needed anything. Come on people - this is VERY basic customer service. If you have to send your food back for possible food poisoning, the least you could do is offer your patrons a drink on the house. Get it together people please!",0.0
"So we usually enjoy bare burger but this time around was different. The spot was packed during lunch hour and we ordered two turkey burgers, the SoCal. They had our order ready almost immediately. The turkey was barely warm, making us question how long did they have these sitting out or how undercooked was it? The fries aren't the best, they are a bit on the oily transparent side. We were both scared of food poisoning from eating cold turkey burgers so didn't finish our meals. I expected better :-/",0.0
"Disgusted beyond belief. Never had a problem with this place and have been ordering for a few years because the selection is so extensive. Ordered dinner in tonight. Hubby got chicken parm. Unfortunately, it was raw inside. My toddlers were sharing with us and my stomach is in knots thinking about this. 

Called them up to tell them. They refused to give credit which is fine, the guy said that people take advantage of it and end up getting a free meal. That's great, however I still have raw chicken under a gallon of sauce? The guy said they would deliver it again in fifteen minutes (which if done so, delivery guy would have discovered said raw poultry awaiting him). An hour passes, another hour... call back....

This guy had the nerve to say ""keep it for tomorrow, heat it up so it's not raw anymore"" what in the world, seriously. Can you say salmonella? Call to the health department? BBB? 

Needless to say it wasn't redelivered. 

Fyi, salad gross, baked clams awful dry disgustingness. Vomit (if we don't already have food poisoning.)",0.0
"This place is the reason why I think many New York natives criticize the transplants. Hana Natural is all pomp with no substance. The food is outrageously expensive and is not any better than what you would find in Cityfresh or Key Foods. This place pretends it is a Whole Foods, but at the end of the day it is just lipstick on a vegan, gluten-free pig. 

The only up this place has is that there are some pseudo-Asian options available here that are otherwise hard to find in the area. Aside of that, the beer is expensive and crappier than Cityfresh (or The Sampler and Hops and Hocks). The food is expensive. The produce selection is limited. 

Nobody who lived in Bushwick ten years ago shops here, because they know better (granted, I did not live in Bushwick ten years ago, but I know better too). 

I don't think you will die of food poisoning if you shop here, but your wallet will suffer a slow and painful death (unless you have a huge trust fund and you never look at the prices of food).",0.0
"2.5 star

this is the SAME place as the Mentaiko ramen placed where I got food poisoning from that was shut down just a month or 2 ago. 

And I believe the same owner and same staffs.  And the interior was exactly the same as Mentaiko ramen. They did not re-renovate at all

Me being a groupon queen, I came with another groupon on a Wednesday night. And this place was empty. We were the only customers throughout the whole dinner. 

Soup: egg drop and hot and sour: both were just ok. Definitely had better

Appetizer: tang tang noddle: super salty again. with tons of MSG..nothing special 

Entree: beef stew: super lack in flavor and it was labeled as being very spicy but it was not spicy at all. Hot pepper chick: the worst one of all. Not authentic at all. Too much breading and no flavor. 

Service: decent. I almost felt bad for the waitress working for such a slow place 

overall: not authentic Sichuan food at all. Go to the one on St marks, or even Hot Kitchen just around the corner. I am just happy at least this time, I didn't get food poisoning again.

sorry but i won't be coming back again",0.0
"I order from here at least once a week. Usually the food is 4 stars, but the food I ordered tonight was one of the worst meals I've ever had. 2 stars at best. I had the fried oyster roll (bitter and hardly edible), the Sake roll (cold and gooey), and The seaweed salad (wilted and soggy like it was made yesterday). Maybe they're trying to poison me? Or maybe it was a one off. Either way not sure I'll be ordering from them again soon. Fingers crossed I don't wake up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. Gross.",0.0
"Wait time for a Friday night at 10 was only 20 min and the hostesses were helpful...then it goes downhill from there.

30 mins from when we sat until they took our order, and they weren't overly busy. 

Ordered the duck lettuce wraps for an app - the food came out quickly and had a nice presentation but we took one bite, looked at each other and spit it out. The duck tasted diseased - it was truly awful / one of the worst things I've ever tasted. So after hailing down a server for 20 mins, we had it taken away. 

Next was massaman curry - which was alright but nothing you'd order again. 

Was excited to try Spice but it was a disaster. On the positive side, we're both feeling lucky to have escaped food poisoning.",0.0
"Bit of a delayed response. I had came to this restaurant only after having eaten at their flagship in Brooklyn. Their Brooklyn location was great, the wait, while long as expected in a packed all-you-can-eat location, was more bearable as the hostess was quite welcoming and asking if we would want any beverages while we waited. This place, not so much as a ""it'll be a short wait."" In fact, service here is just about non-existent. 

How is it possible that we can order something over and over again and never receive it? Is this some ploy to reduce on the amount of food being served? I assumed it had something to do with the 2-hour time limit given to patrons and assuming that the slower they served food, the less we'd eat in a given time-frame. We had to order one of the meat dishes 3 times before it was ever served. I'm not 100% sure how this is possible since orders are taken via tablet. I get it, there are definite gluttons out there, but we were one of the last tables in the restaurant with a group of 12. At least have the decency to bring us enough food to fill each person's hotpot. (Half the group went Korean BBQ, the other half hotpot, which brings us to the next issue...)

The barbecue grill is probably the most useless heating element I have ever seen in my entire life. The hotplate took almost 30 minutes to cook thin slices of meat. We gave up on the potatoes as we were hesitant to eat raw tubers. The waiter attempted to place blame on the overhead air conditioners, but that was a lie given the fact that we never turned it on until the end of our meal. I think it may be a bit of an issue when the heating element used to cook your own food doesn't cook your food thoroughly...

Finally, the place lost our birthday cake. We came with a nice ice cream cake from a local bakery and had asked for it to be refrigerated. Somehow, they gave the cake to the wrong table, claiming that the other table took the cake out of the restaurant. The manager (I assume) returned to our table with the other table's cake, which, thankfully, only had ""happy birthday"" written in Chinese. I'm not 100% sure how the other table managed to take our cake by mistake, considering the fact that our cake came from an entirely different bakery, with different packaging and a clear plastic bag. 

In terms of food quality, it's comparable to other hotpot restaurants. The quality of the food is subpar at best. If you want cheap eats, come here, albeit with a smaller group. Skip the BBQ or you'll get food poisoning and don't bother coming for a birthday. I assume they'll lose your cake too. Maybe they'll offer you free ice cream like they did for us (which you get for checking into the establishment in the first place). 

This place is all of ""meh.""",0.0
"five star to defend this place-   They have been working out some kinks, and try very hard.
The food issues mentioned in other reviews have been fixed-  -  The food is now  excellent. (they made some big changes-  and oh yeah-  cruising in the right direction)
The dining room- meh
 the service - meh
  but give them a shot -  The best restaurants are the ones trying to build a reputation, not resting on one.


(my review is way to high by my standards,  but likely just a response to  Hailey s-  who doesn't seem to understand how food poisoning works, and just blamed the last place she ate)",0.0
"Ok I know this establishment doesn't need another review. 

But I have been to the franchise a multitude of times both in this location and the cooper sq location. 

Pros: 

-fun cooking it yourself 
-locations ideal for before after activities 
-good happy hour deals
-good drinks 
-selection of meats decent 


Cons: 
-poor service...I mean really poor service
-higher risk of food poisoning with cooking it yourself. Or cancer with overcooking. Just can't win
- a bit on the pricey end since it's not all you can eat. This applies to both happy hour and non happy hour

"The guy that works the deli counter is a straight up A*hole. They do not subscribe to the notion that the customer is always right. They routinely raise their voice to customers, I had ordered the same exact sandwich from their deli several times a week for multiple weeks and the price magically changes half the time. Also they are known to recycle their old ""hot"" food from the night before and use it the next morning (yup this is insider information I knew the delivery guy). So all in all, old reused food (with a potential for food poisoning for sure) and a deli guy who could care less if you ever come back to the deli again. Do yourself a favor and walk a block in any direction and go somewhere else.",0.0
"obviously I'm scoring on the scale here, the food cart scale.  Here's my biased  grading system: 
one star:  major stomach cramps, vomiting and/or  diarrhea
two stars:  unidentifiable meat pieces, overcooked/dry rice, mild upset stomach 
three stars: everything went ok, nothing to write home about
four star: well balanced meats, fresh veggies, flavorful rice, good proprietor attitude
five stars:  must be pretty incredible

This cart has two options - chicken and lamb. That is it. Oh, there are colorful photos of falafels, etc. Don't be fooled - they don't make them. 
But as far as chicken and lamb go - they are excellent. I am not sure how Lisa, the previous reviewer, feels cheated with a huge helping of rice, veggies and chicken for $5 but this lower-middle class Sheepshead Bay resident feels the price is fair for well made, fresh, quality food. I don't have it for a week - I crave it. 
There are two other things going fo this cart - 
1. it's open 24 hours a day (guys working in shifts). 
 2. great attitude - 'a little white sauce, lots of red sauce and just a splash of green sauce, and no peppers in the veggies and just a couple of pieces of chicken and the rest is lamb""  ""No problem""

"I give it 2 stars because they actually used real wood chips for the bbq here.  However I have to give it such a low rating because 1/3 of my party got food poisoning after.  

Either the banchan or the seafood pancake or the japchae did it in for my friends.  One person even left before any of the bbq came because she was feeling very ill.  So my deduction is that it happened at that point.  We didn't even drink at the restaurant.  

The meats are good and there is someone who cooks it for you.  The food I would totally come here again if people hadn't gotten sick.

Huge disappointment.  Has anyone else gotten sick??",0.0
"So...per the review from the former employee of Bud's on this page...Bud's is finished. Walked by tonight on my way back from the movie theater and was shocked to see it dark on a Saturday night with two pieces of printer paper stuck on the door that just say 'CLOSED'. After my last visit I figured it got shut down by the board of health but I guess they just weren't paying their bills..?

I had two unmemorable experiences here. The service both times was horrendous and the food was DISGUSTING. Came 2 weeks ago to watch football with a group of people and got some appetizer platters. The food all came out cold, the dips looked like they had been sitting out for hours (if not days) and it was just nasty, greasy, overall no good. I was afraid to eat some of it for fear of food poisoning so I stuck to dry tortilla chips. They even messed up the mozzarella sticks - how is that possible? They had an extensive beer selection but were 'out' of several of the beers we tried to order. Don't put a million beers on your menu if you can't even keep them stocked! Losers. The ladies bathroom was also gross, toilets overflowing, no toilet paper in any of the stalls and no hand soap. I hope someone with some actual business sense takes this place over, hires a decent chef and makes it into a normal place to hang out...that part of Steinway could use it.",0.0
"I know this place gets a mix of reviews, but hubby and I have been coming here for a few years now and we've never had a bad experience.  I normally order the raw steak pho, but I've also ordered the tofu salad, the appetizer sampler and the lettuce wrap dish.  I service is fast and consistent.  When we go at our usual time, they always remember us and are very friendly.  Bottom line, this is a great spot for consistent and cheap pho, especially if you find yourself in K-town late night, which we often have.  I have a very weak stomach and am very susceptible to food poisoning, but I have NEVER gotten sick here, the countless times I have eaten their food.

I am disappointed in the ambience and the fact that the ladies room has been in the same state of relative disrepair for all the years we've been going.  They can definitely step up their game, but I am giving them a 4 instead of a 3 because they have never let me down!",0.0
"I ate this while drunk and it was DELICIOUS. The lamb and rice paired perfectly with the white sauce. Split this with my friend. I am still drunk so I will go here whilst sober and see if it's still as good.


UPDATE A WEEK LATER: Demoted to 3 stars. Why? Because I tried this while sober. When drunk, this is the food of the gods and the best thing you will ever taste. When sober, it is cheap greasy bland street meat that not even the white sauce (too acidic this time!) can mitigate.
Go here if you....
- are drunk
- are EXTREMELY hungry
- have just completed strenuous exercise

And, in my sober state, I am worried that I will contract food poisoning....


UPDATE 3 WEEKS LATER: I got drunk again and this sounded like a good idea. Not only was I drunk, but I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. The combination of drunkness + extreme hunger made this fantastic. In that state, I ate the ENTIRE PLATTER + a shit ton of white sauce. Afterwards I wanted to die.",0.0
